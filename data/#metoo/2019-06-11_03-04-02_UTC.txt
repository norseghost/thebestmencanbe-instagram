•• S I L E N T •• Treatment 
#Advocate #Idaho ————————————————————————
Refusing to listen, talk, or respond to a partner is sometimes called “the silent treatment” or “hostile withholding.” Many abusers cut off their partners emotionally to hurt, punish, or control them. Some abusers even refuse to acknowledge their partners’ existence for hours, days, or weeks on end, making the partners feel as if they are somehow less than human — like a ghost. 
Being ignored is especially difficult for a person who is isolated by abuse and coercive control, and depends on the abuser’s approval to feel worthwhile and safe. Stone-cold silence can reinforce the feeling of powerlessness and fear.

In light of the restaurant industry’s rampant sexual harassment revelations, San Francisco restaurateur, writer and activist Karen Leibowitz had an idea to create posters that could act as a “what to do” PSA, similar to the choking first aid posters that are ubiquitous in New York restaurants. With a little help from @cherrybombe editor-in-chief @kerrybombe and Brooklyn-based designer @kellianderson, her vision was realized, and these posters were born. 🙌 Read the full story from the Summer 2019 Innovation Issue of Edible Brooklyn (and get a free download of the poster) via the link in our bio. #EBdailypic #timesup

We can't just "get over it". We would love to be able to do that. We live in a world that is irritated with each other's mental health. You get sympathy and understanding if you break a bone. You hide any mental health issues for fear of being judged, dismissed, or even accused of faking it. Therapy is expensive, and rarely covered by insurance. No wonder so many of us are walking around broken and lost. .

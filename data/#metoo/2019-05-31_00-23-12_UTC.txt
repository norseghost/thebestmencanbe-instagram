We all have hard days ✨
Every.single.one of us ✨
We are all walking through our own hard things ✨
It’s also so easy to get caught up in lies
✨
Sometimes taking the time to stop and reflect on who God says we are is the best thing we can do ✨
To know you are worthy, you are loved, you have a purpose, you are able, you are mighty, you are strong and you are doing a good job

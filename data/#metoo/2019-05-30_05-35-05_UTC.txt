I'm delighted to announce that "Pudica" was featured in a public lecture at the Australian National University. The question posed for debate was: Can you ever truly separate art from the artist? 'Against the backdrop of the #metoo movement, the conviction of abusers and pushback against misogyny throughout history, how do we separate art from the artist and should we?'⠀
⠀
Hosted by Double J's Zan Rowe, and a wonderful panel including: ⠀
⠀
- Professor Denise Ferris (Head of ANU School of Art & Design)⠀
- Dr. Kim Cunio (Head of ANU School of Music)⠀
- Dr. Robert Wellington (Lecturer at the ANU Centre for Art History and Theory) ⠀
- Dr. Monique Rooney (Convenor of the ANU Screen Studies program and Senior Lecturer in English Literature)⠀
- Ray Mardia (Lawyer and Writer and ANU Alumna)⠀
- David Caffery (Director of both Art, Not Apart Festival and Dionysus and ANU Alumnus) ⠀

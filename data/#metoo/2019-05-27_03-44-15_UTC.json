                        "text": "The power of #MeToo, though,\u00a0 it takes something that women had kept quiet long\u00a0 and transforms it into a movement. It isn\u2019t a call to action or the beginning of a campaign. It\u2019s simply an attempt to get people to understand the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault in society. It's getting women and men to raise their hands. \nWhen i was in sixth grade i have seen flippy iron -rods in markets and bus stands to catch my attention . Old wrinkled iron -rods tried to touch my body on my way to school. Have you ever had a similar experience???? \"YES YOU HAVE \" .\nWhen i became mature i did\u00a0 question it and stood along for that helpless girl or boy in tears who doesn't know what is going around ....!! Now , When someone\u00a0 start to glare on my body , i learnt to ask them \" Did you find anything interesting than your women's (wife sister mom or daughter) ..??\" because\u00a0 now i understood what was he searching ...Here\u00a0 society silently granted\u00a0the permission for verbal abuse.\nAfter watching these hash tags i understood one thing that #metoo is normal !!!! Dehumanization is made more likely and even institutionalized in our society - our workplaces, our dating and relationship norms , our family, in our building architecture, our technology, our media and entertainment, our language, our policing, our military, our morality , our custom and practices and many other places. \nHere i wish to raise my #metoo for the outspoken , for the abandoned , for the girlchild who couldn't recognize the smell of fluid from her uncle's hand , for the little boys still unaware and playing with strangers\u00a0 finger tips... and also i started to change that #metoo to #metoowillreportit. Raise your voice for children, protect them and make them aware from abuse through the concept of unacceptable \"bad touch\". This communication must be friendly, and frank, and teach children how their sexuality works so they don\u2019t unknowingly harass others.\n\u2665\ud83d\ude4f"

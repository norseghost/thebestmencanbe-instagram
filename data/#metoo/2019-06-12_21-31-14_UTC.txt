I forgave myself for what I did to me. So your judgment is self projecting. I am not my past and my past will not become my future. 
I've been an alcoholic,
I smoked half of my life away before I stopped. 
I slept around like a harlot thinking it would bring fulfillment.
I've been sexually assaulted and never knew how to say no or stand up for myself before that and even thereafter.
I've tried to commit suicide multiple times and all attempts failed. 
I self mutilated long enough for my thoughts to become scars and for my inner self to become nothing.
I've been addicted to narcotics.
I was exposed to adult vulgarity at 5 years old and spent half of my teenage life trying to break that addiction.
I've been a cleptomaniac. Before you point your guilty finger at me check if you've had my shoes on your feet. I went through all of this alone and healed myself with God's guidance and when I met my soul mate letting all of it go was easier than I ever thought it could be. But you; looking at me like I'm beneath and you talk about me behind my back, YOU don't deserve my kinship because after all I have been through I have learned what loyalty is and I have learned what friendship is and you stick to your shit when it comes to being there for others so If you can't return my loyalty you can turn right around.  #metoo #idontmind #mentalhealth #atpeace #healing #gettingthere #everyday #progress #diditwithyou #onlyyou #onlyGod #grateful #positive #Imadeit #life #happy #thriving #itsokaynottobeokay

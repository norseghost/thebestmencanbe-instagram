What is it? How do we reconnect with which has been lost? 🌿Source energy is the vibrational existence that connects us to the earth, each other, and our universe. Everything in our universe physically vibrates and never stands still, including ourselves. 🌿When we struggle with mental health whether is be anxiety, depression or other, we can experience disassociation from reality, and vibrate at extreme unnatural lows. 🌿How can we reconnect with our earth and source energy to raise our vibration?

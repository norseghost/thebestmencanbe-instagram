❁ WHAT ARE SEXUAL ABUSE, ASSAULT AND RAPE? ❁ (TW: r*pe, s*x)
This comes from the website of Planned Parenthood. 
Sexual assault or abuse means any unwanted sexual contact. This happens when someone uses force or pressure (physical or emotional) to get you to do something sexual.
Rape is when someone forces or pressures you into having sex. Rape usually means forced vaginal, anal or oral penetration by a body part or object.
Some examples of sexual abuse and assault are: 
someone touching your breasts, butt or private parts without your consent
someone showing you their genitals or making you touch them without your consent
someone rubbing their genitals against you without you consent
someone forcing you to kiss them
someone holding you down, and kissing, touching or rubbing against you
someone smacking your butt without your consent -

The person doing this could be a complete stranger, a family member, a friend or someone you are dating. It doesn’t matter. It is still wrong. Everyone has the right to decide what happens to their body.
If a teacher or an adult tries to touch or kiss you sexually or asks you to do something sexual with them, tell another adult as soon a possible. What they are doing is not okay. They are 100% WRONG and it’s only their fault, not yours.-q: If you were forced to be on any reality show, which one would it be?

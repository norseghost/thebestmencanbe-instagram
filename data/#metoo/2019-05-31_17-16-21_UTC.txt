खुदा होना चाहते थे तो तुम्हें ख़ुद को खोजना तो था ही नहीं, तुम्हें खोना था खुदको। खोजने वाले खोजी होते हैं। खुद को खो दो आज, अंतन हो जाओ आज। (Something I heard in an osho's speech)

This topic I'm discussing right here is a little controversial and can be easily misunderstood in this era of women empowerment.
First off I'm not against women empowerment or feminism although I have a little different definitions. For the independent women of today, we are loosing our essence , that abstract feminine side which is our trait, it's something that we own. 
But due to this revolution of us becoming independent and more masculine, which is beautiful by the way, we have forgotten how to be soft, how to loose oneself, how to be an art and the most important HOW TO LOVE.
Lately I've realized that love basically is what makes us , creates us and breaks us. Love is the ultimate truth. But we consider love to be merely a relationship. A girlfriend and boyfriend thing. Two people wanting to make out and have sex. Isn't it so so wrong and limiting?
Love is surrender, feeling like the person standing next to you, is not just a homo sapien rather that is the energy, everything that you are willingly loosing all of you for them or maybe yourself, as there is no difference. No illusion of distance. When you love you connect. You kill yourself to become nothing and everything all at once
Both men and women are incomplete without this experience

When SELF CARE is a part of your daily routine.....
Yesterday I participated in Her Love Spell Baltimore. We photographed, networked, and dined at Ampersea Baltimore Harbor after making our beauty statements. The weather was absolutely perfect for lunch on the patio with a group of beautiful women. Self care isn't just about what we do to our physical selves but more about the whole self..Mind Body and Spirit. I can truly say my soul was fed yesterday afternoon. Between the positive vibes and the breeze of the Bay, my soul was free. This is how I choose to take care of me...living my Best Life.

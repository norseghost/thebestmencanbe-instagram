Adélaïde Bon’s memoir, ‘The Little Girl On The Ice Floe’, translated from the French by Ruth Diver, is a work of the utmost shining brilliance. A vital meditation for the #MeToo age, Bon’s story of rape and trauma is told with punishing detail, unravelling as a novel, told in a mix of first, second and third persons as Bon battles a history of suppressed memory and dissociation. This is a book wrought with emotion that draws the rawest emotion from its reader, leading one deftly through Bon’s own complicated journey. Ultimately it’s the book’s third part, that recounts the trial of her rapist and the testimonies of his other victims, that is the most unforgiving and somehow uplifting, finding solace and strength in voices, in the pursuit of justice, regardless of the complexity of its outcome. I also loved Bon’s decrying of “our fascination with the guilty parties”, her insistence that we should “celebrate the courage of the hundreds of millions of victims to whom no-one ever listened and who manage to make it to the end of the day alive, feeling so abandoned, so downtrodden, and so terribly alone.” In a time of endless portrayals of Ted Bundy and Charles Manson, these words in particular struck a chord. Thank you to @quercusbooks for sending @_yourshelf_ a copy of this book, newly published in the UK by @maclehosepress.

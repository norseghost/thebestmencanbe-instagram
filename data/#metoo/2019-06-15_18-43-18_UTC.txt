Time does not heal all wounds...In order to heal, we need to confront our past and make sense of it and then peace with it. And there is no set time schedule in order to heal. And even with time and hard work, there are wounds  that are so deep, scars remain as does some of the pain. But with time and fearless, hard work, I believe we can get to a place we can not only survive but thrive.

“I wanted to go places where I feel like as a black man we don’t always go. It hasn’t been part of our culture. When I was talking about being molested, it was like man, you know what? I’m going to write about this,” he said.⠀

“In black and brown communities we do deal with this. I’ve visited prisons where men are like, ‘I was sexually abused.’ A guy on my own team came to me and said, ‘It happened to me when I was younger.’ I’m not caring about the stigma. I’m going to speak it with the hope that other people heal from it.”⠀

He says he blocked the situation out of his memory, but it resurfaced in 2017. “I kind of wiped that out of my mind for a while. For a long time. I had a tendency to do that, to tuck things away in a corner. My journey back to it came with all the work I’ve been doing on myself, from prayer to meditation to therapy to art. I didn’t even realize it happened until I was doing a film called The Tale, which deals with that subject matter. I actually told my costar, Laura Dern, ‘Yo, I think this happened to me.’ It just started coming back to me.”⠀

He said he has always been close with his mom, Dr. Mahalia Hines. He said the conversation, “wasn’t as heavy as I thought it would be. She worked in Chicago public school as a principal and teacher, so the stories she’s heard....Obviously it’s different when it’s your child. But she said, ‘I hate that these things happened, and I know people that it’s happened to before. Are you okay?’ She checked on me.”⠀

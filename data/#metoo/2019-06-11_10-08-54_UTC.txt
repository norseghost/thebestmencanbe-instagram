I used to ignore bad behavior of others and keep giving people the benefit of the doubt. People revealed to me who they were (bad) through there words and their actions - but I NEVER BELIEVED THEM. That was naive and dumb. That had me trusting and giving my time, love and energy to bad, negative and even abusive people. Honestly, ignoring red flags nearly killed me. So now I see and acknowledge  red flags AND I act accordingly. I will do what I have to do.  Don’t get it twisted. I just won’t argue about it. Take care of you.

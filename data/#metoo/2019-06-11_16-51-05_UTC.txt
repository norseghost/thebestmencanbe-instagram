Thank you to Hot Lunch Music for such a lovely review of FIRE GOES TO DIE 🔥 You made my day ☀️👉🏻

"Many stories have come out since the start of the #MeToo movement, but Vezilj’s “Fire Goes to Die” does an amazing job of summarizing the feelings and experiences many girls have had to face over the years. With a heavy guitar sound reminiscent of something you may hear from Johnny Cash and beautifully light vocals, this song speaks to the strong, unwavering woman role-model today’s world needs." 📷: @jus10h

The Narcissistic Trick.
.
We've all heard of gaslighting. That game narcs play to keep you guessing to the point of losing your mental footing and question your sanity.
.
Well there's another trick in their bag of wonders. 
I call it the Emotional Reset.
.
They will take you down a path where you become angry and fearful. They will put you in such a state of anguish, and when your just about to pull the trigger and speak your mind, they do or say the most endearing thing. .
They make you feel amazing and finally seen and heard and that they really do care after all. Then what you just went through the past week will be swept away. Gone with the wind. Like it never happened.
.
He has just successfully Emotionally Reset you. Only for him to ramp you up all over again.
This is the game. The control. You are his puppet and he is the puppet master.
.
I've created these workshops to shed light and educate you. I want to help you be set free.
.
Please consider this as your golden ticket to finally understanding and freedom. See link in profile.

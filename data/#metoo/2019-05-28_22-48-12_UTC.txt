Little do people know is that I have a story myself. When I was 18, I had gotten pregnant. I'd only been with the guy for about 5 months, and I really liked him. We both were in shock, and decided not to have the kid as we could not afford it. I was still living with my parents, as I was about to head off to college for the first time. I did not want them to find out so I went to Planned Parenthood and got my abortion. They made me feel so comfortable, and even helped with sponsoring us to pay for it. That guy I was with then I am now married to and we've been together for 6 years now. He's the love of my life, but if we had a kid we would not be together. I feel so much better after having had it, I have no regrets and know that I was not supposed to have a kid at 18 to raise one as a young adult. I still do not have kids and don't want to have them until we have a stable environment; I want to cherish our time without kids for now. I'm still young and want to live my life. I feel stronger and more empowered to share my story with others to let them know they are not alone. Reading the #abortioncoalition stories is amazing, and helps me reach out too!!

new episode of #letitoutpod today with NYC dating expert @clarapersis. I spent a weekend upstate with Clara and loved chatting with her about her take on #dating and #partnerships in 2019. We discuss everything from using #dating apps, #chivalry in the #metoo era, going up to cute people IRL (so scaryðŸ˜³) and so much more. This one is a two-parter so weâ€™ll get more of Clara next week too ðŸ˜Š The link to listen is in the bio - I hope you love this one as much as I loved recording it!

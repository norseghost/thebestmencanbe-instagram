DON’T CALL ME DARLING is a protest song against sexual harassment and toxic masculinity told through 50's, punk, Tchaikovsky and jazz. 🔥🖌 I wrote this because cis-guys kept calling me darling. "Aw it's so CUTE and COOL when cis straight men say or "joke" that lesbians "should" kiss for them, remind us that they have a penis and libido and how totally "ok" it is that patriarchy "rewards" them with freedom of movement," SAID NO QUEER TRANS / NON BINARY/ WOMXN / PERSON OF COLOUR EVER. ⁣⁣⁣

Fake admiration and unwanted attention crumbling to aggression and ignorance. Every time someone annoyed me I added another verse but to be honest if this song was as long as it needed it to be, it would last more than a few weeks.⁣ ⁣

🎧 Hear the song with subtitles via my BIO LINK where you can also discover five facts about this song! 🦑 Squid & The Krakens were my first band (2013-2016). We performed this when we headlined Transpride, Brighton in 2016! A slightly different line-up played on our 2nd EP " The Flying Coffee Machine". If you really like it, you can buy it on Bandcamp for £1! I won’t mention iTunes I guess..😏

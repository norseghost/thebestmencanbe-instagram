#repost for #youknowme I am the 1 in 4. I am stronger now than I was 10 yrs ago. But I still and probably always will, hurt, for the decision I made. Even though it was heartbreaking I know it was the right choice at that time in my life. If I hadn’t had the choice I genuinely don’t think I’d still be alive today to write this post. The ONLY person that has any right to make the decision about wether or not she can carry on with a pregnancy or to judge a woman for the decision to terminate a pregnancy is the pregnant woman. No one else gets to judge or decide. No one! .

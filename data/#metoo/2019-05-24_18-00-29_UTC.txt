With everyone so excited for Nv tags dropping today I can’t wait to get my hands on the best deer tag in the nation. The coveted California Archery only tag. It’s a six month long season just about!!! I’m really hoping I get it this draw season! •
Is anyone excited for their archery only tag this year?

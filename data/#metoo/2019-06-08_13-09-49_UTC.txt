Another important stigma we have to break. “It was a spur of the moment tinder bootycall. I got to hers and decided I wasn’t really in the mood anymore. I felt bad so we cuddled a bit then I said I wasn’t feeling it and wanted to go. She stole my phone, locked her door and stood in front of it and wouldn’t give my phone back or let me leave until I had sex with her. I did it because I didn’t want to cause a scene. I got home, threw up and showered for 30 minutes to try and feel clean. I never reported it but let’s be honest even if I did, there’s no proof and I’d be laughed out the room as a guy complaining about having had sex.”

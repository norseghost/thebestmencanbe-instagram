In todayâ€™s world of equality obsession on every front, there is one HUGE inequality that glaringly remains. For every one white abortion there are almost four black abortions. Simple math shows that abortion is the most racist area of American society. Do black lives really matter? Not too much to those who vehemently support abortion. #blacklivesmatter, #metoo, #abortion, #abortionrights, #blm, #prolife, #costsofabortion, #katyperry, #kanyewest, #kimkardashian, #plannedparenthood, #snoopdogg, #nancypelosi, #arianagrande, #justinbieber, #prochoice, #humanrights

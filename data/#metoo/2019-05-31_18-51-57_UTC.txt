"Just what do we think our stories deserve? Is it arrests, convictions, loss of income or social status for the accused? This is because we have, as a movement, really invested in the carceral system to validate and vindicate our experiences of violence. But for many immigrants and women of color, who are targeted by those systems, this is asking one abuser to hold another abuser accountable."

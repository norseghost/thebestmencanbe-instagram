#story it's a long one but if you're my friend please watch.  I had a very scary experience after work yesterday and am sharing 1. Because I feel helpless to do anything else and 2. To make sure all of you,  especially the ladies, stay alert when traveling alone at night. .

For those who know me and consider me "strong"...im really struggling a bit with my sense of self right now.  I'll be okay, i know this isn't on me and will continue fighting the thoughts creeping in that say otherwise. .

Diversity & Inclusion 
Organizations are now realizing that their revenue is tied to diversification and not of just race, but gender, class and thought diversity.  The challenge is that many organizations don’t know how to effectively engage diverse members of their team to increase productivity and create a culture of inclusion.  I offer a high intensity training that will address critical barriers, discuss your organizations pain points and use innovative methods to address diversity and inclusion using an upstream to downstream approach. 
Although each intensive is customized to your organization's unique goals it features: *  Scope of Work
*  Hands-On Didactic Education
*  Executive & Leadership Coaching
*  Organizational Development Consulting
*  Evaluation Summary
* 12 Nurse CEU’s

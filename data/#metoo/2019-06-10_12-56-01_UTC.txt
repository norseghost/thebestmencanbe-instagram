We are excited to introduce our June Issue featuring Mindy Raymond @mindy_benson, President of @newrepublicstudios, who is pioneering innovative progress in the film industry and advocating to bring more production work to Texas. We looked to history to find a matching map of Mindy’s career and this issue’s inspiration, uncovering a woman whose extraordinary and under-documented contributions to cinema were unparalleled…a brilliant auteur who intuitively used her medium to advocate for progress and invite women colleagues to sit at tables and climb ladders with her an entire century before today’s #TimesUp and #MeToo movements galvanized. That woman was Lois Weber, and she lived from 1879 to 1939. Mindy Raymond shares on her mission to bring more productions to Texas, her career background and how it prepared her for this new leading role, and her inspirational takeaways from the life of Lois Weber.

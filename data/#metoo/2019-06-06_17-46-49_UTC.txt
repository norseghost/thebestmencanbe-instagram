Today we visited the exhibition “She Persists”, on view at Heist Gallery in Venice. .

The group exhibition, which is timed to the Venice Biennale, brings together work by 22 artists. Among those selected by the show’s curators, Mashael Al Rushaid and Sona Datta, are Judy Chicago, Lynda Benglis, Guerrilla Girls, Mithu Sen, and Hamra Abbas. Tonia Arapovic has contributed a film starring Rose McGowan, one of the leading voices of the #MeToo movement.

One of the biggest lies we tell ourselves as survivors is that we're not worthy, we don't deserve happiness or joy or love or family or a million other little things that we see others enjoying. But that's the thing: it's a lie 🙅🏼‍♀️ You deserve happiness and healing and all the joy 😍💙 You are worthy of that and so much more 💐💐💐 #fridayvibes #supportsurvivors #believesurvivors #metoo #youareworthy

This book came out four years ago (?!) and I'm fortunate/tired/heartbroken/lucky to still be asked to speak on how it keeps moving through my life and communities. You can find me and this dog-eared reading copy at the #feministsdeliver conference this Thursday, where I'll be part of a panel with @fireseed.facilitation and Jamie Lee Hamilton on #metoo as a cultural movement, facilitated by Sonmin Bong ðŸ’•

This is (perhaps not surprisingly) the first time I've been asked to present my queer-specific work as part of the larger cultural conversation about sexual violence. You can bet I'll be talking about that, too.

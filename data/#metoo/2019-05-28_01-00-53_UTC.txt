It took 10 years for me to be able to read my War Journal. Honestly, I believe it was because I felt so much guilt for leaving my boys and girls behind. I was there to protect them...and I felt guilty for leaving. There are people in my journal who are no longer here. They gave their lives to make the world a better place. I’m ready to share my stories and my lessons learned, my failures and my successes. I am wired to help and protect...this is my why. 🧜‍♀️💪🏼 #sirenstrong #publicspeaker #motivationalspeaker @athenasvoiceusa @heroicpublicspeaking #war #warriors #honorthefallen #memorialday #veterans #militarystories #fighters #wso #aviator #HERo #metoo #woman #womenempowerment #mentoo

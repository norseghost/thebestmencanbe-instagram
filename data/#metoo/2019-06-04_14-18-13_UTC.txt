Today's Tip Tuesday is for you, hiring managers!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Screening candidates can be challenging, especially in the digital world. When you interview the "perfect" candidate, it's always a good idea to check out their online presence (and not just on LinkedIn...here on Instagram too). Are they showing up as their best self both in person and online? Does their authentic self portrayed on social media match your culture goals?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This doubles as a tip for candidates as well. Personal branding online is crucial to being hired for your dream job. Hiring managers are looking at your online presences, so make sure that you're showing up as your best self.

I'd love to hear your thoughts! Do you check social media profiles as a hiring manager? Why or why not?

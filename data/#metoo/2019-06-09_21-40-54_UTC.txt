I have always seen certain people in movies and music as my hero’s. Elton John is my Number 1. I have always wanted to run away and escape my life to become them. Travel back in time to the 70s or the 80s to live a different life. Listening to Eltons music as much as I am still little old me, gives me an escape to those worlds and to my future as a performer. It gives me hope that one day I will be sitting on movies sets acting my little heart out! I will work hard, listen to songs of Elton while it rains and forget who I was born to be and become who I want be!

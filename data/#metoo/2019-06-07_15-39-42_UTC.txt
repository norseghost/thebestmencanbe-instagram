For nearly 100 years, the ACLU has been our nationâ€™s guardian of liberty, working in courts, legislatures, and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties that the Constitution and the laws of the United States guarantee everyone in this country (from the ACLU website). Their role, essentially, is to protect civil rights and protect 1st amendment rights. They were involved in the 1977 Nazi trial in which they were in accordance with the supreme court. Interesting note: their average donations are 4-6 million a year; after Donald Trump's election, the donations skyrocketed to a cool 120 million.

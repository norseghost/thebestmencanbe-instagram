We were tired of trying to fit into someone else’s cookie cutter mold to make it in the Hollywood film industry. We were fighting to fit in an ocean with a current pushing against us. Trying to appease an industry that doesn’t want us to be ourselves. That makes us feel shameful for who we are. Stereotyping us into characters they create and in a box we can’t break out of. 
How do you stand out when they want you to look the same? How do you stand out when they don’t like the way you look? You have to live your life as plain as can be until someone says: I choose you! 
How do you get back up when you get thrown into constant rejections?
When Maissa is too white to play an Arab but too Arab to play a white person. When Blakely is too tattooed to be viewed as wholesome, or he is too bald to be the good guy next door. When Jesse sounds too gay to play a “regular” male role, or Kelsey is too brown to be considered a lead in Mid-Western American film and Julie has to compete with every brunette in her age range. 
Don’t be too sexual, don’t be too gay, don’t be too pretty, don’t be too ethnic, don’t be too Arab...
Well, f*ck it. 
Let’s make a show with all these characters. With strong females, with gay men, with Arab Muslims, with unapologetic sexual content including fetish and kink. Let’s put a Muslim Arab woman in the same scene as sex toys - something unheard of! Let’s put men spanking each other, let’s talk real #metoo experiences! Let’s choose diversity and inclusion. Let’s choose sex positivity. Let’s showcase an audience that always feels left out. Let’s change the narrative. That’s how the little idea of what Dirty Love came to be for what it is today. 
The indie film movement is making a comeback and that’s what’s going to make a change in the Hollywood film industry. Change is coming and we are going to be part of it. 
Thank you to everyone who has supported us! ✌🏼

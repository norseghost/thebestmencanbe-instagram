#newborn the transforming monument of Kosovo. Built in 2008, it has seen many different skins. This week it is called Reclamation! 99 faces of women who have formed part of Kosovo's history, influence, change and future. I've had the honour to meet some of these women this past week in Prishtina and Prizren. How cool is that!!!!!! ❤️✊️💗💪

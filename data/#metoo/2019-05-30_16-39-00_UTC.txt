Most of us think we know what our kids are up to in their spare time. We believe our children would never do anything to hurt themselves or us. Mehek’s parents must have thought the same. But little did they know she was using drugs and alcohol. And that it all began at the age of 13. 
Here to talk to us about how drugs and alcohol destroyed and reshaped her life, is Mehek Gidwani, who’s been in recovery since 2011. She shares her firsthand experience about taking drugs and alcohol and talks about discovering the roots of the illness, the know-how behind the addiction and how she has found freedom from the obsession. She’s now a trained Recovery Coach and yoga therapist and has started her own addiction recovery program helping others recover.

She’s our gentle but very strong NRIWoman and this is her story.

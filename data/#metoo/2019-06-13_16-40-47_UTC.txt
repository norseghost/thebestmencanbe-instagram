In a disappointing turn of events, the Mumbai police has given #nanapatekar a clean chit in the #tanushreedutta sexual harassment case. Apparently there was no evidence against him in the case.
***
Tanushree issued a statement against the Mumbai police saying that they were ‘just as corrector as Nana and gnat the witnessed in the case had been intimidated and bullied’
***
Last year Tanushree’s allegations against Nana Patekar sparked off the #Metoo movement in India. Women from different fields called out powerful men who had harassed them.
***
Denial of justice, corrupt legal and judicial systems and society’s judgement and harassment of survivors are just some of the reasons that prevent survivors of sexual abuse from coming out in the first place.
***
Tanushree plans to continue fighting for justice. She was one of the main catalysts behind India’s #metoo movement and we thank her for her courage and voice to stand up against sexual harassment at workplace!

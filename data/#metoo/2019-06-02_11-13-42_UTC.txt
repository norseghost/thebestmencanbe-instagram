Netflix's The Perfection unlike it's name is imperfection but that doesn't stop this from being a good film.

The first 2 acts of this film felt at times like the writers didn't know what film they were trying to make with their fairly well played out, if somewhat slow, bait and switches on horror sub-genres and villian but this left me at points feeling disappointed, annoyed, frustrated and scratching my head wondering if this is gonna happen with every title carded chapter throughout this film. Then the third act came and they settled on what this film was suppose to be all along, a rape revenge movie, where they try to push through their message in all the rather satisfying and enjoyable limb-lopping madness.

This film tried it's hardest to be a poster child for the #metoo era, but it was a swing and a miss I feel falling into the same old worn out movie tropes this horror sub-genre has to offer with nothing new being brought to the table. What saves this however from being just a convoluted mess is the two compelling and empowering performances from the female leads, Alison Williams and Logan Browning, who have great chemistry together and the rather over the top so called "shock" moments.

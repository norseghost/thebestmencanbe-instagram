                        "text": "Do you trust yourself? Do you ever speak your truth? Do you know your truth?\n\nWhen you allow yourself to speak your truth, you learn to trust yourself!! You learn to dream for You, not for your well meaning but flawed family, not coz religion dictates, not coz you must, not for your Instagram followers, not for your boss, or partner. You learn that you KNOW the way! You learn that YOU are the sign you've been seeking. Trust yourself!! *Last Wednesday I sat tearfully reliving my story to the NHS IAPT Mental Health service (Even counsellors need counselling, I can't rationally deal with cptsd or the burden of palliative & trauma care without it, a surgeon can't operate on themselves! I've also reached breaking point with hypervigilance and need more support!).\nI was scared, vulnerable, exhausted working through the list of symptoms, checking my memory recall, explaining the trauma, and the affects it has on my daily life. My therapist looked at me and said very simply: 'Trust yourself, your doing the right thing for you, I trust you;TRUST yourself. Cue tears and more tears. When you've been repeatedly told for years through maternal suicide, childhood verbal, emotional & sexual  abuse, narcissistic abuse, hyperreligious upbringing & distorted media influences to NOT trust yourself, that you are not good enough, not worthy, a sinner, a bad influence, too weird, too rebellious, too loud, too damn much. You stop trusting yourself. You don't believe in yourself and you forget your worth. BUT you are more than good enough. You are you, your trying your working on being the best version of YOU! Not the best version of their truth, but the best version of Your TRUTH. Noone else can walk your path, they can walk with you or lead you astray or block your path to detour you to theirs BUT noone can walk your journey but YOU!  TRUST YOUR TRUTH!\n#nfiniteheart #t3lesto #mentalhealth #trauma #depression #MeToo #healing #survivornotvictim #fighter #cptsdwarrior #counselling #fight #youvegotthis #strong #trustyourtruth #trust #bethegood #onlyoneyou #youknow #truth #yourjourney #yourpath #follow #followyourpath #abuseawareness #suicideprevention #hypervigilance"

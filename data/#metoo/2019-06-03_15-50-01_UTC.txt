Not sure if this is still going on but yesterday it was such an unexpected gift! We took the little man down to the mall to see the new dinosaur exhibit at natural history & found this! Hundreds of quilts made by survivors of sexual assault lined up all the way to the capital. This one in particular really moved me, I thought of you guys & how much I value & cherish my relationship with all of you! While I haven’t experienced sexual assault I can certainly relate to having other women come together & support one another. Your words of encouragement give me the fuel to move forward, & not give up, one day at a time... ❤️❤️❤️#womensupportingwomen #believesurvivors #metoo #timesup

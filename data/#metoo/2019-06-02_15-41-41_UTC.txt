In the midst of the #Metoo movement and the push to understand consent, my body my choice must include our baby boys. Women it is hypocritical to ignore(support) the violation & mutilation of our lil boys. There are no good reasons for infant circumcision. They too deserve respect & basic human rights. 
We cannot address sexual violence against women and ignore the normalized sexual violence against newborn boys. The implications of this are serious. There first sexual experience is a mutilation of their most intimate part without their consent. Let's leave this practice in past where it belong, just like female genital mutilation.

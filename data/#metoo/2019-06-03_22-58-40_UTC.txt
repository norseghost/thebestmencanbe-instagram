Your body needs rest. It's not possible to go go go all the time like that. 
Cars needs gas and regular maintenance. 
You are so much more than a car. 
Darling, you are made of stars. 
It's not needy to need: it's human. 
It's who you are. 
You are not a machine. 
Water your plants and water yourself. 
Let go of this mask, this seeking, this perfection, this "one day" attitude. 
One day is here. 
It's today. 
Tend to your current sleepy needs and be patient with your energy. 
It comes and it goes.

Really, I just can’t help myself. I was looking at posts for #NotMe as a response to #MeToo, and this popped into my feed. It’s from @no.filter.here. 
It is really rather appropriate since I’m writing about #ImpactInvesting in #PrisonReform and the difference between #PrisonAbolition and #ImpactPolicing, meaning initiatives that promote #decarceration and #profitability. 
Heaven help us bring our folks home, be they in jail, prison, or migrant detention centers. May we end all forms of violence, from rape to incest to militarism to human trafficking. May we make peace real.

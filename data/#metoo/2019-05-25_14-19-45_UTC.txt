This right here is a victory for me. No it’s not because I feel confident or because I think I look good (although I am feelin good about me these days!) ((TW: sexual assault))
.

It’s because I went to a show last night. Just something local at a small venue. For the first time in a while, I wasn’t hyper vigilant. I wasn’t anxious/scared for no reason. My eyes weren’t constantly moving to identify everyone in the room as a threat. I am a sexual assault survivor. And I have been doing months of trauma therapy in order to get my life back. And this is what healing looks like to me. The little things make a huge difference. .

If you are a fellow survivor I say this because I genuinely want everyone to feel healing. If you are constantly playing the scenes over and over again in your head and you feel anxious and depressed and like a ball of awful energy. If you feel nothing and have to suppress feelings. If you are ready,GET HELP. I’m serious. Find a way to see a professional trauma therapist. Call up people and ask if they do EMDR m. If therapy isn’t an option (because it’s expensive I know) there are some free Instagram accounts giving out amazing info: @_mombojombo_  @the.holistic.psychologist @heathertuba and much much more out there. The info they give has been a great supplement for me, and can at least help you to understand how trauma effects you. Also, just know that I see you. I acknowledge your pain and send you love.

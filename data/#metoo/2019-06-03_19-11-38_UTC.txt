Have you had this experience?  The more important an activity is to your soulâ€™s evolution, the more resistance you will feel. When you reach that resistance whether it is self-doubt, fear, or something else, do not back down.  Do not quit.  Keep moving forward. Work through the resistance.  You were meant to do this! ðŸ’œ

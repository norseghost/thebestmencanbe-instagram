(he wasn\u2019t too bad at this point, i\u2019d only had a comment here and there, and this was my first job so i didn\u2019t really know what to think). anyway i gave him my number, and he immediately tapped it into his phone, looked at me, smirked and then phoned it. it was actually my number and my phone starting ringing next to me, but i still felt humiliated and kind of scared because what would he have done if it was the wrong one? it was only me and him at the bar, he was my boss, this was my first ever job and i was FIFTEEN YEARS OLD. he was in his THIRTIES. \ni\u2019ll now never work in a pub again, not as a kitchen porter. FUCK THAT. (my older brother is the best guy you\u2019ll ever meet, he\u2019s a feminist and goes to rallies for women\u2019s rights, he did stick up for me and quit with me after a week of putting it up with...just putting that out there, my brother didn\u2019t just stand and watch and not do anything!)\ni\u2019m backkkk, still hella poorly, but backkkk!\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\n\u2022\n#feminism #feminist #metoo #prochoice #lgbt #loveislove #bodypositivity #equality #wlw #selflove #selfcare #selfconfidence #womenempowerment  #blacklivesmatter #alllivesmatter #gaypride \ud83d\udc96"

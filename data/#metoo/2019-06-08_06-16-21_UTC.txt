True power: Tarana Burke at the 30th International Trauma Conference tells the story of her nonprofit “Just Be” girls programs and how they coined the phrase “Me Too” to establish solidarity for survivors and raise awareness of pervasive sexual abuse and assault in 2006. She would go into schools in Alabama and ask for lists of all the girls who had been suspended and create girls circles with them offering tools and support for recovery. She basically intuited her own trauma informed practices for processing story and embodiment. Trauma is nothing new. The best treatments are found in community, in doing things we already love—singing, dancing, skating, yoga, play... Now we have the science and a language to shift power back to its source—ourselves. #metoo

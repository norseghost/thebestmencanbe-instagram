This moment is really all we have! The past is the past and the future is the future! True joy comes from being right where you are right now! I’m not saying it’s easy (I struggle everyday trying to stay in the moment🙋🏻🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ like really appreciating this sink full of dishes right now🤣) but if you are searching for joy try practicing being present! Today I’m going to practice loving the ordinary moments! Candi 🌸

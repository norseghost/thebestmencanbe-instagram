I’m sitting here working on my new play script and I had to stop and take a moment to take this in. I mean, to have an opportunity to bring your work to the world? It’s a beautiful thing.  I’m thinking about the Toronto arts community, Native Earth Performing Arts, Marjorie Chan, my mentor, all the many fellow artists in both Toronto and Vancouver who have encouraged and supported me.  The Ontario Arts Council, Volcano Theatre, Cahoots Theatre, Buddies in Bad Times Theatre, NEPA, Canada Council for the Arts, my beloved friends...the list goes on. I feel blessed beyond my own imaginings and I cannot wait to see where this all goes. I promise to give back, always.  Abundance is a real thing, friends, and it shows itself in many glorious, creative ways.  #artist #playwright #actor #newplay #storyteller #believerindreams #metoo #artandlife #abundance

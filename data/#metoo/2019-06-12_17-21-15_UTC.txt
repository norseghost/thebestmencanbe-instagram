We are troubled to hear that yet another former university doctor has been accused of sexual assault, this time at UCLA. It’s important for survivors to come forward and to tell their stories so that Dr. James Heaps is brought to justice. There is strength in numbers.

Let’s hold Dr. James Heaps and any university system who ignores the signs of abuse accountable to the fullest extent of the law!

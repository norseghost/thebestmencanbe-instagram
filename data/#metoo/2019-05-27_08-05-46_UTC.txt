When you’re the one who cares the most, loves the hardest, and misses too much, you give all of yourself to those who matter. Everything you have is put into others because you truly believe in the magic of relationships. You walk around with so much to give, and sometimes, that is too heavy a burden to bear. Sometimes, people don’t need your love. Sometimes they just don’t want your love. Sometimes, they simply take advantage of your love. If you care too much, you’ll know the feeling.
One would think with all this love to give, someone would embrace you with open arms and refuse to let go. One would think this person wouldn’t want to see you break. One would think…
Am I not good enough for you?
Do I need to express myself more?
Do I need to express myself less?
Do you appreciate me?
Do you know how much I love you?
Do I even make you happy?
Do you miss me?
Why won’t you tell me you miss me?
Do you think about me when I’m not around?
Do you dream of our future together?
Would you pick me over her?
…what about her?
Why do I love you more?
Do I need to change?
Am I beautiful enough?
…thin enough?
…smart enough?
What is wrong with me?
Am I not good enough for you?

To the those  who love with their entire hearts, who pour all of themselves into the relationships, into the people, into the family members, the friends, and the men/women they love—don’t ever change.
Don’t let the world make you harsh because it doesn’t understand the power of forgiveness.
Don’t let life turn you cold because people haven’t discovered how loving doesn’t make you weak, but actually gives you strength.

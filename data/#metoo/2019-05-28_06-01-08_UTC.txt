Miss you two is an understatement. So blessed that last year I was already three months pregnant with your sister Amelia grace and now nothing will ever keep her and mommy apart ever again. No one is better than your mommy and I promise that I will love you babes long after my dying breath! Give the mama bear and the grands a squeeze from me #pregnancyloss #memorialservice #mybabies #evelynmarie #dj #duckie #iam1in4 #metoo

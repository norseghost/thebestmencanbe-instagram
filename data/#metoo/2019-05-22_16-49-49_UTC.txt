“I’ve learned abusers make sure that the adults are on their side, so that when a child says something against them, then the adults call that child confused or a liar.”

Everyone says they would of course believe and support a child, but when it actually happens to someone we know, we automatically think something else must be going on because we know this person. They would never do anything like that, and they never acted like that with us - right?
•
Well that’s exactly how abusers set up their “chessboard” and maneuver us around it so we will say exactly that and believe them.
•
It’s actually really easy to get off the abuser’s game - if we believe, protect, and defend the child no matter what.

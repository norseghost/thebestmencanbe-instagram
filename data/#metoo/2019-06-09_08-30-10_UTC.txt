As a memoir author of my book It's No Secret which breaks silences over childhood sexual abuse and the impact this can have on ones health and wellbeing throughout life I now run an online Support group called Speak Out Sisterhood for women who have experienced childhood abuse, sexual violence and or domestic abuse.

We support, cheer, advise and embrace each other and our experiences.  Some of us speak out, other's only speak and acknowledge their past to themselves. 
It's their choice. 
What I do know is that the more we break silences and share our stories the more we challenge myths, break taboos and give courage to other's to acknowledge their past in whatever way they choose.

I shall not hush, I shall continue to beat my drum loudly until violence and abuse against women and girls STOPS.

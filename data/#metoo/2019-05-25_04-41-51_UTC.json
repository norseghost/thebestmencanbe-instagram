                        "text": "I created this account while struggling with intrusive thoughts telling me \"no one understands\" \"you are alone in this world\". I spent a good amount of time trying to think of a username that matched my goal. A goal to reach out to others who felt isolated because of their mental health. A place where I could go and reassure myself that I wasn't alone in my struggles. \nHaving lost contact with practically everyone because I couldn't even text them; I knew I had to start with that fear. \nHowever I failed. \nI couldn't message them, it had been to long and I couldn't do it. So I figured I'd try and start fresh, reach out, push myself into public view. \nI knew I wasn't alone in feeling/ being alone.\nThat's where my username came from. \nNot some crude informal invitation. \nAnd now I'm facing an untreated \"symptom\"; to which I've yet to get any answers about: dissociation. Normally I can keep it at bay but this level of stress and anger has opened the door to a living hell in my body. Do you have any idea how terrifying it is to dissociate and lose all sense of yourself. It's not fun for me. It's not fun for my family.  It NOTHING like what you see in movies. It takes away the things I normally can use to cope.It's scary and Isolating. \nIn this moment of slight clarity I've decided to change my username. To what? I don't know yet? \nBut I can tell you one thing: every single male who messaged me demanding I speak to them, demanding I send pics, demanding anything from me. \nYou have been incredibly lucky to have gotten to speak with me, you had the chance to be blessed with kindness, blessed with unlimited understanding,but I swear to the goddess if you had been speaking to me in that tone in real life. I swear to god. I swear you would have seen hell herself. I am not blessed to have endless patience.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nim fine with respectful conversation but if you take personal offense to this post; you and i won't get along. \n#mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthjourney #mentalhealth #depressed #depression #dissociation #anxiety #anxious #ocd #ocdawareness #metoo #metoomovement #girlpower #feminist #selfcare #selflove #mybodymychoice"

At the World’s largest conference on #genderequality I’ve reflected on the words of many advocates and agents for change. From #Design icons @johncaryjr to #MeToo @taranajaneen and the numerous other necessary founders and key catalysts of some of the most important movements of our lifetime they all have inspired us to speak up with our voices and take power with the tools at our hands. I feel blessed as an educator and creator to bring these lessons back to the classroom but also share my students' understanding of #ThePowerOf ...Design. Here now I continue as always to reflect on #thepowerofdesign and #thepowerofwomen. .
Thank you @women_deliver #WD2019 #genderequalitymatters

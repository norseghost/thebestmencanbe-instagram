I canceled my family membership. Because all we really have is our actions. I stand by a teacher and students who are standing up for their dignity. What do you stand for, the side of an institution that came up with weak and flimsy excuse and blamed other people for their institutional discrimination. What does that say? I believe the self policing by the museum, the self serving statement and their conclusions that it was a misunderstanding and that museumgoers were at fault are weak cop outs. They took no responsibility and cast doubt and shadow on the word of children and their teacher who lived the raw experience.  People talk about being satisfied with the evidence, who has the evidence, who saw the evidence, who concluded that they did nothing wrong? #mfaboston. #unfollowmfaboston #cancelmfaboston

As for me, I am a father and a proud Latino, I am also a lawyer who has lived similar experiences at the hands of judges with heavy double standards and ignorant lawyers who donâ€™t where their Klan hoods in court but should so we can signal them out like #mfaboston. I have also as a kid and as an adult been racially profiled and followed by security and by police just because of the color of my skin or the language I choose to speak to my children. 
This world needs to hear from children when they are mistreated, from women, from lgbtq+, from minorities and anyone who is discriminated against. All discrimination should be brought to light to be weeded out. Because that is how change happens. This is how we protest, by likes and comments and by pulling memberships and boycotting establishments who act inappropriately themselves or through their agents. 
This was my response to an ignorant comment who afterwords blocked me so he didnâ€™t have to look in the mirror without his Klan hood. ðŸ˜‚

This is also Lynn Gehl. Every Tuesday from 12-1pm she holds a protest outside of Maryam Monsef's office to encourage the federal government to eliminate gender discrimination in the Indian Act and pass Bill S-3 into law with all clauses removed. .
.
.
Bill S-3 was voted through by our MPs back in December 2017, the UN told Canada to implement the bill and remove ALL sex discrimination from the Indian Act this past January and in February the Senate told Trudeau to pass the bill.
.
.
.
Right now Monsef and Trudeau could " issue an order-in-council that proclaims the clauses into law. Once proclaimed through an order-in-council they immediately become law and there is no requirement for them to go through the Senate and the House of Commons." .
.
.
They could sign a piece of paper and Lynn Gehl could get back to doing whatever brilliant works she does but they don't because we are a country ruled by white supremacy and colonial violence. .

I've put the link to her petition up in my bio. If you swipe left you'll see the letter I sent to @JustinPJTrudeau @MaryamMonsefMP and @Carolyn.Bennett.StPauls. If you want a copy DM and I'll happily send it along.

This is really scary. But it feels important to put out there. I will not be telling the details, as I do not feel comfortable sharing them, but I think I'm finally ready to join this magnificent, strong movement, with my own voice, and my own experiences.
Furthermore, I need this to be out there not because I want attention, not because I want pity, not because I want anything other than people who are scared, who feel alone, to know that they aren't. They are not alone. We are not alone. I am not alone. No one is. 
If anyone at all is out there seeing this, feeling scared and alone: you are not. And if you need someone to talk to, even if I don't know you-- and I know that can be terrifying all by itself so no shame in speaking to someone else just as long as you talk to someone-- I will be here for you. I will be a someone to listen if you need me to be. I will be here for you. No one should handle this type of thing alone. 
You will be okay. 
I will be okay.

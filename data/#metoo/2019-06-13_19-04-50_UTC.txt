ðŸ’™ðŸ’¥ðŸ’™ Reposted from @dhlovelife -  This is a picture of me after an intense scene in #sense8 
But  Iâ€™m using it to focus attention on a critical issue - please read 
#NicoleBrownSimpson and #RonGoldman were murdered 25 years ago on this day & their families and loved ones have yet to see justice served - however, months after the murders & spurred on by the tragedy, President Bill Clinton signed the Violence Against Women Act into Law 
The #VAWA began to take domestic violence out of the shadows - creating a much needed helpline and somewhat improved law-enforcement responses. 
1 in 4 women in America will be the victim of intimate partner violence &  Nationwide more than 1,100 women are killed each year by their intimate partners, most often by gunfire - in 2017 alone there was a  74%  increase in reports where  firearms played a role in abuse & an 11% increase involving children 
In April this year, the House voted to reauthorize the #VAWA, but the bill faces an unlikely future in the Senate.
Thereâ€™s still so, so, so much more to do to protect victims of domestic abuse & violence -  Please Call Your Senators!  #MetooÂ

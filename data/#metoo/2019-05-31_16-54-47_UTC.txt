I’ve always been very hesitant about sharing my work on social media, but sometimes our work as artists is too important not to share. Not genius or ground-breaking, just important. I hope you’ll hear us. I hope it moves you somehow. 
Special thank you to my dancers for their emotional investment in my work, commitment to my choreography, moments of improv, and for sharing their stories. It’s time to fight. ***I do not own the rights to these music selections/recordings. ***Recording credits: “This is What Donald Trump Thinks About Women” - The Democrats (YouTube) “Best of Bernie” -Eireen Cullen (YouTube)

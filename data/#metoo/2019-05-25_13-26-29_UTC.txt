It's good to see @natalieportman speak up. Many of us don't - because we're afraid, because we don't have the resources, or the words, or because we are facing a threat of retaliation.

When I was in my late teens, I had a man in his 50s talk about his sexual history and offer to pay me for sex while trapping me in the window seat of a long-distance bus, I was followed home by (sometimes drunk) grown men on multiple occasions, and a teacher at my high school in his 30s decided he wanted to date me. All I wanted was to be safe, study, read books, and meet my friends. Instead, I got a plethora of unwanted sexual advances from men who I've never met before or after to a man who met me on a regular basis as a teacher since I was as young as 14. The world is a scary place for young women. I hope it won't always be this way. #metoo

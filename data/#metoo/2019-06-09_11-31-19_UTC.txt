The Tony Awards ðŸŽ­ are tonight. The two nominees for Best Revival are Cole Porterâ€™s Kiss Me Kate and Rogers & Hammersteinâ€™s  Oklahoma. Theater is all about perspective and my oh my, how different yet fundamentally similar these American musicals are.
.
One is a lively faithful revival based on Shakespeareâ€™s Taming of the Shrew and the other is a complete deconstruction of a classic about love on the American frontier. What they surprisingly have in common is the subtext; American society protects and elevates bullies.
.
Me Too ainâ€™t no thang here. The audience laughs and applauds at the witty foreplay as Kate, the female lead, is bullied, abused and stripped of her consent by men who need her work product to profit. Everyone stands idly by as it happens. She fights tooth-and-nail but eventually admits to being helplessly in love to the fella who betrays her trust. ðŸ¤” Oh, did I say the dancing is spectacular!
.
Okalahoma, on the other hand, is a decidedly dark deconstruction. While remaining obedient to the text, this production shifts perspective from one of young love to the destruction of Jud Fry, a loner, a farmhand, by a community that shuns outsiders. 
You will be hard pressed to think the cowboy and the farmer can be friends after Curly sings "Pore Jud Is Daid". High schools are gonna have some splaininâ€™ to do if they wanna stage this show from here on.
.
Though I enjoyed both shows, my vote for Best Revival goes to Oklahoma. It is an audacious production that has made the 76-year-old musical relevant to todayâ€™s conversation. Itâ€™s a must see. And you get a bowl of chili, rice and cornbread during the intermission. ðŸ˜‹

Feminism: A range of political movements, ideologies, and social movements that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the genders.

It's not supposed to be about hating men. It's about wanting to be seen as an equal, a partner, a person to stand beside you not behind you. Men and women working together to make the world better. 
Thanks to @brittanysuetattoo for doing an amazing job on the tattoo, to @shayraeslays for being my partner in crime today, and to @metoo_springfield for working to help and educate the community.

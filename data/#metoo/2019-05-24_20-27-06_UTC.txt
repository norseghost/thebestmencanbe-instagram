Yo @taranajaneen where's the #MeToo movement on this one? Or is it still not your business/responsibility to go after white men?? We all know you're white funded but damn, really? Not a peep?? That figures. We all also know you're not as stupid as you look. Not try'n to mess up your butter biscuits and ur spot in the big house, huh? 😒 #CooningOnTheRise

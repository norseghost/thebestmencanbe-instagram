Woke up to someone trying to videocall here. I ignored. Then he sent a video of him playing with himself. By this time I might have been a bit angry so I wrote. " That is disgusting. And it is small so I am not sure why you wanna show it. Congratulations on the report and block!". #bitchmode And after a minute I felt bad for calling it small because I know that is a sensitive topic to guys. But then I got mad at myself because I should not feel bad! He should feel bad, ashamed and everything for sending that to me! He is the one sexually harassing me so I have no regrets anymore.  The sad thing is that I get These every day. Yesterday someone even made this üòç scale for me to judge his dick. Creative but still oh so disgusting.

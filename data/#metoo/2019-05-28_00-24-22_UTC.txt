i think fatigue is one of the hardest things for people to understand. healthy people canâ€™t comprehend what itâ€™s like to sleep for 13 hours and wake up exhausted, to have to rest after a shower, to feel like that flight of stairs is mount everest. fatigue is different than being tired, fatigue is still there when you wake up and it stays with you all day. itâ€™s a lack of energy, a feeling of mental, emotional, and physical exhaustion. 
today iâ€™m beyond fatigued and i have the worst migraine. iâ€™ve been going going going this whole weekend because i just moved from oregon to washington. unpacking and moving into a new house is EXHAUSTING especially when you have me/cfs. i think i need to rest for a week ðŸ˜´

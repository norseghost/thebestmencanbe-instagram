We might be feeling uncertain about how Australia will deal with our family violence epidemic after a conservative government has been re-elected.
But we also know that the Liberal Party of Australia responded to our policy survey about nonviolent abuse, along with the other parties we contacted.
We wanted to have the election commitments of major parties in writing so we could hold whoever came into power to account.
We were shocked that the Australian Labor Party opted to completely ignore our enquiries.
Both @BillShortenMP and @LindaBurneyMP received separate and timely communication from us but did not respond in any way.
We will post correspondence from the parties who did respond on our website shortly.
We feel that this demonstrates how uncomfortable powerful groups in Australia are about having conversations that address family violence.
But just because it is difficult to talk about doesnâ€™t mean it is ok to ignore it.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised India’s vote in the United Nations against a resolution to recognize Palestinian NGO Shahed, signaling that India might have a new partner. Netanyahu tweeted on Thursday: “Thank you Narendra Modi, thank you India, for your support and for standing with Israel at the UN.” The previous day India cast a vote against giving UN observer status to Shahed, which Netanyahu’s government accuses of having links to Hamas. The vote represents the first time that India has cast a perceivable pro-Israel vote at the UN. #Israel #BenjaminNetanyahu #Netanyahu #UnitedNantions⠀

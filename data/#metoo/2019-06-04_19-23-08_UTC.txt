.
Does your heart have room for one more beat. 
Can your mind receive just one more dream.
Do your lips have time for one more kiss.
Or will my love for you dismiss.
.
Do your hands feel empty without my skin 
Can you see just one more dream within.
Can your lungs inhale just one more breath.
Will you accept this one request.
.
Do we have time for one more dance.
To blend our bodies and loves enhance.
Will we be done and lost for good.
Or will we dress our hearts with love.
.
Can I stay hear for one more day.
As we make love and wash away.
Can you accept my heart once more.
And give to me, give to me yours
.

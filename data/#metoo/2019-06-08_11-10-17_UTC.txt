A short poetry about s. abuse

TRIGGER WARNING!

My soul got shattered into thousands of pieces, every night you crossed the line.
My body freezed and my mind was somewhere high above me.
You stole my childhood.
You killed my soul.
And buried me alive.
That’s how it feels like.

Sentences close people said to me when I told them; after years of being silent and struggling with my mental health by myself. -Get over it, it happened years ago!
-Why do you even think of it?!
-If you struggle with it it’s your fault cause you don’t  wanna let go of the past!
-You could have said something!
-You don’t have the right to feel bad about it cause you could have prevented it by  telling someone!

IT‘S NEVER YOUR FAULT!!!

Please keep that in mind! You deserve so much love and peace and your soul need time to heal!❤️ It wasn’t easy writing this.
But it’s still a taboo in our society and I wanted to write those words, to show other human beings that they are not alone❤️ Much love to you all!❤️ PS: Sorry if there are spelling mistakes, my english isn’t that good🙏🌹 .

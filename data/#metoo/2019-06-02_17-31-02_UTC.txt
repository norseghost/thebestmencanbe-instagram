Iâ€™d love to express my gratitude to Princess Angelique Monet and Princess Moradeun Adedoyin-Solarin for making it a mission to promote and support - with the United Nations - film projects which REALLY aim to give voice to important causes. As giving voice to women is not merely stepping on a red carpet wearing a black dress.

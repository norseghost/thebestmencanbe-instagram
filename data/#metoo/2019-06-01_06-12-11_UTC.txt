If she wore a short skirt or dresses then she was doing it to get attention from the boys .
If she wore pants,shirts or had short hair she looked just like the guyzz.
If she hung out with girls and no boys then she was "too reserved like what the fuck ?!" If she hung out with boys alone then she was "doing it " with all the men .
If she liked to play sports she was laughed upon and told to go work in the kitchen .
If she wasn't athletic then she was a typical girl , too -feminine.
If she was incredibly successful and a total boss ,
She had apparently slept her way to the top.
If she was strong then she was called unemotion "like do you not have feelings"
If she was sensitive then that was just the "menstrual mood swings".
If her clothes were revealing then she was just "asking for it ".
If she was at covered up then " girl loosen up a little bit ".
Like in this society there was no way she could win , she was always wrong.
Or some kind of use object.
Good thing she was stronger than all the them .
Good thing she rose up despite the fuck they said .
Good thing she was made of fire .
Good thing nothing they said touched her for she was a fighter.

Well ladies and gents, where do I begin.  The year has come to an end.  The Era or the Mike Lynch matignon may be at its end.  From the first day I met mike by the water fountain by the gym, to our last theology class.  Mike has had an impact on me, and everyone reading this.  Not just known for his life on the ice, but the boys have learned to love him for his life off the ice.  No homo tho it’s that bromance love.  If we don’t get mike back next year I know I speak for all when I say, “good luck mike, we love you”. That’s a wrap.  #BoyYouLookinLikeYouGonnaCry #metoo #LongLiveLynch #bromance

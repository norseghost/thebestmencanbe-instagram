As mentioned in my previous post, this weekend has been a challenge. I’m learning to process these emotions, instead of pushing them away like I have done for so long, and then move forward. Part of recovering from years of abuse involves not allowing this person to continue holding power over me. I let myself feel all of the emotions all weekend. Except it was a tidal wave. I didn’t work out, I didn’t practice choreography like I needed to, and I ate like I was punishing myself. And then today, I woke up, and allowed myself to push past it. Enjoyed a walk around my new city with my family. Living in the moment and making memories with my husband and children. And tomorrow I will wake up and do it all over again and make even better choices. Truly one day at a time. Patience. Kindness. Love.

*For my followers who know me in real life. I’m actively working on finding a therapist. This is the next step. I’m trying to find one that is either Latino/a or Black or another POC because I feel that’s important with my history. That struggle in Pittsburgh though... 🤣🤦🏻‍♀️ .

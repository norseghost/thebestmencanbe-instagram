My Morning Cup of Coffee - "I've learned to love myself unconditionally because I am a queen". Stand in the mirror and say that 10 times and see how you feel. #SusaninspiresðŸ’‹ #transformationalthinking #SaturdayCoffee
I love those lyrics from India Arie's hit song "Video". Acceptance of oneself is difficult enough. Lets not reject one another on the basis of beliefs. Perfect love casts out all fear. Be strong enough to have a conversation. Be humble enough to listen. Strong Women Love Unconditionally. I Am You, You Are Me and Together (only together) We Are.  #Coffeeforthoughtâ˜•
There are no mixed messages here. I BELIEVE IN PERFECT LOVE...

cw: sexual assault, domestic violence "You asked if you could hold my hand...
I never thought you would cut it off" 
Sometimes I need to make pieces that aren't silly or funny. This is a personal piece about being a survivor of sexual violence- but it was also made to speak on domestic abuse. 
On average, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States. During one year, this equates to more than 10 million women and men. 
Every 92 seconds another American is sexually assaulted. 
intimate partner violence accounts for 15% of all violent crime. 
only 34% of victims are able to seek medical care for injuries related to domestic abuse. 
Between 21-60% of victims of intimate partner violence lose their jobs due to reasons stemming from the abuse. (https://ncadv.org/statistics) (https://www.rainn.org/statistics/scope-problem) 
Because of this I'd like to donate any and all profits made through my store with this piece to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence and RAINN.

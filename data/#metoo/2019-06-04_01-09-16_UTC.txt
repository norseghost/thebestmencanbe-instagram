I went to Pure Vitality Wellness Center for a BioMeridian scan! I found out so many things about my body! Apparently my body hates avocados ( which Iâ€™m not mad at because I donâ€™t like them anyways ðŸ¤£), dairy, goat, and especially caffeine! I have a vitamin D deficiency, candida, hormone imbalance, and no vitamin B like at all, apparently thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m so exhausted not just #momlife ðŸ¤ª. Looks like I will definitely be ordering ALL the supplements this month! 
Have you ever had a BioMeridian scan? What did your body tell you?

Credit to @wholesomebadass : My older son asked the meaning of this phrase yesterday.  He recognized it pretty quickly and we were able to name safe ways to endure until we may safely exit. “Having an elephant in the room” means that there is an obvious problem or difficult situation that people refuse to acknowledge and in which attempts at discussion are prohibited if not  punished.  A scapegoat is typically the one who needs to examine or reconcile the matter.  RATS 😡  I forgot to add “disconnection” - that shitty feeling of separation from others, ourselves, and #reality ☠️ •• My son related the example of my relatives gathering with his father and his brother and without me— and everyone behaving as if I do not exist — the unspoken rule to not mention me or things that relate to me.  He articulated a pretty sophisticated understanding of these politics.

I was able to share with him how this is a symptom and the normal way of being in sick relationships— which one or more people are addicts and/or abusers requiring complicit denial.  The threat of truth speaking or having feelings is real. 
The room with the 🐘 is the least safe place for truth speakers and deep feelers. #elephantintheroom #empath #thestruggleisreal #beware 🤐🙈🙉🙊 #silence #rape #metoo #incest #shame #survivor

Today I went back to my apartment and stayed for a long period of time since my assault and since my ex started stalking me. I threw out all the blankets used in my sexual assault, all his stuff he left behind and started to take back control and power in my life. I’m no longer living in fear and it’s glorious 💖🐅 #survivorstory #ptsdawareness #mentalhealthawareness #ptsd #metoo #survivor #ptsdrecovery #recovery #anxiety #depression #mentalhealth #mentalillness #positivevibes #selflove #selfcare #believesurvivors #believewomen

Thank-you FCM for inviting me to be your Keynote Speaker at the annual Women’s Breakfast today! A room full of PHENOMENAL, TENACIOUS, and RESILIENT WOMEN! I am honored to be representing Teamsters Local 855, Teamsters Canada, and the Canadian Labour Congress. It is imperative that we continue to communicate the importance of diversity, especially in leadership positions. We MUST continue knocking down the barriers, because the world WILL be very different, WHEN it is led by women❣️😉😘 #FCM #FCM2019 #clc #teamsterscanada #teamsters855 #womeninpolitics #cdnpoli #femtors #sheroes #payequity #childcare #metoo #equality #wecandoit

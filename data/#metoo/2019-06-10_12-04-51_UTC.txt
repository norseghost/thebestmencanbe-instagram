"The central image is a a mannequin head and part of a torso of a woman. But, it's only part. And, I think that's sort of symbolic of the movement for women: that it's unfinished, that there's still things to be done." — artist Jim Bremer on how his #artwork was inspired by the #MeToo movement

In these polarized times, #CatoInstitute’s inaugural #art exhibition aims to provide a unifying platform of civility and creativity. #Artists from across the country—in a wide range of media—share innovative and thought-provoking perspectives on freedom and the enduring need for its protection.

Freedom: Art as the Messenger is free and open to the public Monday-Saturday from 10:00 AM-4:00 PM from April 11 to June 14, 2019.

Post your photos and share your thoughts on the artists' interpretations of freedom using #ArtMessenger.

You can also browse the entire gallery online, and register for a variety of events at the link in our bio. All the artwork is for sale. #CatoEvents

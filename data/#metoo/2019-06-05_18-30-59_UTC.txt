#MeToo, #TimesUp, and #BelieveSurvivors have dominated the public narrative over the past couple years, highlighting the long-term impact sexual violence has on survivors. We strive to create safer communities where sexual violence is no longer tolerated, and we believe everyone can contribute to this vision. 
NJCASA will host six virtual conversations from late June to August. We want to talk to YOU: the conversations will focus on how parents & caring adults ðŸ‘¥, athletic leaders ðŸ“¢, and mental health professionals ðŸ§  can get involved in preventing sexual violence.

Sign up to be part of these conversations and learn more about how you can get involved ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ (Link in bio!) #safernj #safernjkids #safernjsports #safernjminds

TONIGHT, I will be sharing some of my work as a creative advocate, screening a short film - Caressed, followed by a talk w/ Q&A. 'Caressed' is an art film and a self-portrait, mixed-media video installation combining performance art and a poem I wrote about a traumatic childhood memory growing up in a cult and being sexually abused.  This piece is a part of a series with my personal work within the art movement: What’s Your Elephant – Creative Conversations about the Unspoken.  The intentions behind sharing this very personal ‘elephant’ is to break the stigmas and open up the dialogue surrounding unspoken topics such as abuse, survivors of abuse, awareness, the power of a ‘share’ and how the arts can be used to heal, to empower and to educate. .
What’s Your Elephant is a movement that creates a safe space for people to use the arts to have dialogue and bring awareness to the unspoken.  It includes visual and performing arts, interactive arts, creative community building, hands-on projects, workshops and events.  You can connect with the movement via Facebook and Instagram - @WhatsYourElephant .
The Pompano Beach Cultural Center created this monthly Film Series to Showcase Local Emerging Filmmakers at the City’s Cultural Venues.

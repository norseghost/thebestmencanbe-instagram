17-year-old Noa Pothoven had requested euthanasia under Dutch law but been refused. She died in her home after refusing fluids and food since the beginning of the month. Her parents and doctors agreed not to force feed her, and offered palliative care instead. Pothoven’s autobiography details her experience with sexual abuse, PTSD, anorexia, and depression. She hoped it would reform how young people facing mental health crises would be treated.

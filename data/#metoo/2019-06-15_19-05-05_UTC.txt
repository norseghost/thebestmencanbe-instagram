"I want to use comedy to raise awareness about sexual assault, rather than reinforce the rape culture that encourages it," says our featured artist of the month, Diana Varco.

Her one-woman show, Shattered, is a dark comedy about dating, dysfunction, and sexual devastation — told through the voices of 35+ characters. 
Read more about her journey as an actress, comedian, writer and storyteller — and her mission of using humor to heal in our latest blog post.

Plus, if you are in the LA area, you can see her show TOMORROW at the Lyric Hyperion theater in Silver Lake!

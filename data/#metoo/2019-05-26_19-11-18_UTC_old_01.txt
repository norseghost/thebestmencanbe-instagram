I’m sorry for the pro choice abortion spams but the recent laws in Alabama are really pissing me off. Women should be able to make the  choice of carrying a child if they want because, you literally don’t know anyone’s situation. Banning abortions takes it away from human beings who realllyyyy need one like in cases of rape or the mother’s life being endangered.

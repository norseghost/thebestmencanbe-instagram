** NEW Episode 43 now live ** She started using drugs innocently, at the tender age of 13. What began as fun thing to do hanging with friends, went onto become an addiction overtime and ended up being the most important thing in her life. Taking muscle relaxers, Ketamine, alcohol and more,  seemed so paranormal to her. But when her life started to fall apart, is when her family intervened and rehab was her only way out of this addiction.

Here to talk to us about how drugs and alcohol destroyed and reshaped her life, is Mehek Gidwani, who‚Äôs been in recovery since 2011. She shares her firsthand experience about taking drugs and alcohol and talks about discovering the roots of the illness, the know-how behind the addiction and how she has found freedom from the obsession. She‚Äôs now a trained Recovery Coach and yoga therapist and has started her own addiction recovery program helping others recover.

She‚Äôs our gentle but very strong NRIWoman and this is her story.

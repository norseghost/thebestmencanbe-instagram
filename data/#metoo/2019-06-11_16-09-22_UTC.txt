Not so simple to share pics of my family when I've willfully estranged myself for the betterment of my own health and increased safety for my only child... I adore them in every way they choose to show up in this world. Being their parent fuels me to be a better advocate. They're such a poser for photos but an amazingly honest soul who knows what they like. 
@esdubs, as far as I'm concerned... you're now my brother. Tell yo mama she's got another dissociative kid. ðŸ¤£ You've been a better brother to me than anyone else and I adore you forever and always. #spreadqueerjoy #30daychallenge #photochallenge #day11 #myfamily #queerkidstuff #queerfamily #queerfam #queerfamilies #survivor #metoo #posttraumaticgrowth #selfhealers #nonbinary #enby #lgbtqia #pride #prideðŸŒˆ #pridemonth

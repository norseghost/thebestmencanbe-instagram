Going off of my last post a lot has happened these last couple of weeks. As I might have mentioned in previous posts I’m currently prosecuting my rapist and it’s brought out a lot of information about him that’s hard to swallow which is partly why I started this page to begin with. We’ve had several hearings of which a lot of restrictions have come from (I have an order of protection, he has to wear an ankle bracelet, no contact order even through a third party, he can’t be around any female without supervision, can’t watch porn-lol-and a whole lot more). But once the hearings are over obviously there has to be a conclusion and he didn’t accept a plea deal which would consist of him registering as a sex offender since I’m not his only victim (found that shit out in a hearing) would have to do extensive therapy, take regular polygraph tests as a part of his therapy, give a verbal confession to all the charges (2 felonies one of which is mine and a misdemeanor also in conjunction to my case) and do community service and something else I can’t remember at the moment. But he obviously didn’t wanna register so he took it to court where I will stand trial (possibly if she’s not selfish) alongside my witnesses (ex best friend) who was there when I was raped. So that has been my life the past couple weeks while also recovering from ankle reconstruction which has been kicking my ass😊 if you’ve read this far I ask you what your thoughts are on all this cause I don’t even know how to feel about it so please comment below❤️ more updates in future posts #metoo #rapesurvivor #ptsd #survivor #dearrapist #findyourself #nomeansno #endvictimblaiming #consent #healing #timesup #support #rapevictim #rapeawareness #strength #endrape #hope #cptsd

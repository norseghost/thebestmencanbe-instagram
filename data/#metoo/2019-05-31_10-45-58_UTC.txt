*1 week left!* Come along to the free ila launch event next Friday June 7th from 6:30-9pm @ Old St. Gallery to listen to Winnie share her story.

ila is a social enterprise that aims to shed light on gender inequality and how it leads to gender-based violence. We do this by bringing together a community of young, socially-driven individuals, purposeful brands and sexual violence survivors to make a difference. Our ilaX events, inspired by TedX with a gender lens, are at the core of this interaction. But any great vision starts with 'The First Step', which just happens to be the theme of our launch.

Make sure to grab a ticket as space is limited. Did we mention free drinks on us? ðŸ¤— Ticket link in bio x

At what point are we going to have a real conversation about the Beckys, Karens, and Dianes who are actively harming people of color doing reproductive justice work?

How can you truly serve patients of color if you're actively hurting the people of color you're supposedly in solidarity with?⠀

“Abortion rights activists depend, to some extent, on one another, and the relationship between Roberts and JWHO is a fraught one.

The posts did not name names, but Diane Derzis, the majority owner of JWHO and the majority or sole owner of two other clinics in the South, readily did when I called her: “It’s about Laurie, specifically.” She told me she takes particular issue with some of Roberts’s children sitting on the M.R.F.F. board and occasionally joining her at conferences, despite the periods when the fund cannot afford to cover clients. “I called the I.R.S. I reported it. I feel like a — what’s that called? A whistle-blower,” she said. “I want to know — where’s the accountability?””

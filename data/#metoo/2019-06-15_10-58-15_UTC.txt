Bollywood Actor Acquitted Of Sexual Harassment Charges ￼

Bollywood actor Nana Patekar was discharged of sexual harassment charges after police said on Thursday there were no sufficient evidence against him. Patekar was indicted by actress Tanushree Dutta of sexually molesting her in 2008 on the sets of a film they both featured. Patekar has been denying the allegations. But they resurfaced in 2018, causing India’s #MeToo movement and leading to Dutta registering a new charge.

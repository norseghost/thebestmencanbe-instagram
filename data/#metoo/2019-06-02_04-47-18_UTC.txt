It's hard to grasp the concept of choice when you never had it before. I was telling my therapist that compliments make me uncomfortable because I never got them before. They don't feel real and it took me a while to realize people expected me to say "thank you". Taking our lives back is awesome and powerful, but we gotta figure out how and what it is first. .

It's sad that I lived so long without basic decency. People don't understand because living like that is beyond comprehension. .

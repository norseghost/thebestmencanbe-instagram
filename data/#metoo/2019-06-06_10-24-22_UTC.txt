/DEATH AND HER CHILDREN/
.
'Pull out'
'Harder',
'Come on, almost there'
'Finally'.
I hate to admit this,
but this blood-smeared knife is soul food to me right now. Even though I can't take off the veil of repercussions from my head,
there is absolutely zilch that I regret. Your blood constantly oozing out of the stab holes makes me want to flush all of those years of trauma into the pool in which your body stays put now. I swear I haven't been this content before. You taught me dirty games while I grew up, long long before I could label the games as 'Clean' or 'Dirty' and so
for years, I couldn't undress the scarf of squick. Back then, I didn't try retaliating because I didn't know how to.
Tonight,
You did it again.
Almost in the same setup,
the same place,
in the same parts of me.
But remember?
I had warned you that I breathe fire now and that I will burn your body with my one exhale,
which has this baggage of my dead yearning and joy constantly triggered by the speckles of brewing rebuke.
You should have listened to me when I squealed: 'NO'
But you kept arguing whilst your chin was drenched with lust disguised as saliva.
I wasn't playing hard to get, someone should have already told you.
Look,
What you made me do. I killed my Father's eldest brother. Father didn't teach me this.
But he taught me to not be tolerant while someone consumed you. He taught me to seek vengeance in fair ways. Maybe my way was a little extraordinary, but tell me.
What choice was I left with?
When you kept your fat filthy fingers still smelling of cheap tobacco, down there.
I just couldn't bury myself again.
So I had to stab you exactly 15 times,
to mark the number of years I lamented for.
Life is good now.
Your death is my liberation.
Now,
I am a free woman, for a few more hours before they punish me for a murder, this brutal.
But I swear,
I am the happiest today.

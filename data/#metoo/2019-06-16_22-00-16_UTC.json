I actually intentionally use cameras that I know every button and adjustment by touch without needing light for night shooting. .\nBut for 5 minutes all I could hear through my headphones was our footsteps and clothing brushing between boots and torsos. That and the racket sound of a couple old shooting contraptions. I couldn\u2019t see a damned thing other than shadows. The ultimate sense of focus and being on a mission. I also understand maybe only 6 words in Rukiga. The red light check was to pull me back into reality to prep myself for what we would film next. Momentarily backlit and visible to Matt.\n.\n We\u2019ll be releasing the official 1 minute trailer for Victors this week. The documentary premieres October 12th in Michigan and chronicles concepts within EDJA\u2019s first years putting a stop to sexual assault and gender based violence in Nyakagezi Uganda.\n.\n.\nMatt and I double shoot many of the real life scenes and he caught my silhouette right before I shut my headlamp off. We tried to shoot with ZERO input light from a production sense, I wore boots to protect my ankles and a dark hoodie to stay hidden. We hunted down two perpetrators this night thanks to Bosco, the police and members of the community coming forward. .\nThis is a pulled @mattstauble frame.\n.\n.\n.\n#edjafilm #victors\u00a0#yourvoicehaspower\u00a0#nomore #metoo #prevention #enough #documentary #film #uganda #bts #dappgeo"

Yes they cannot be alone ever! 
Things they tell the new supply:
1. I’m getting a divorce because things just didn’t work out but she’s being difficult 
2. We are separated 
3. She’s crazy 
4. She just won’t let me go I told her it’s over
There’s many more. What that really means is I’m still sleeping with my wife/girlfriend and telling her I want to work things out. There is also other women I have relationships with but since you are new you don’t know the real me. They ALWAYS overlap and recycle. They are masters at living double lives!

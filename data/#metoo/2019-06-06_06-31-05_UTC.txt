Picture this. Its 2019, people need to establish organisations like @thursdaysinblack , @projectconsent & @thursdaysinblackvuw to fight for the rights of victims of assault to not to be blamed for it. Thank you for the locals @wgtnrapecrisis & @wgtnhelp for the amazing work you do!. The #UDHR was signed in 1948 to make the world a better & safer place to save humanity from horrible treatment yet in 2019 academics have written a book called 'The Devils Advocates' which refers to the broken  criminal justice system that has let up to 90% of abusers walk free across the world for reasons such as "wearing attractive  clothing which suggested they were asking for it and many more obsurd reasons. Its 2019 and people still try to silence us. People lost their minds watching #13reasonswhy season2  because Bryce was set free while his victims suffered little did they know its an everyday reality and it was made to reflect the #brockturnercase. Its been over 50 years. We need to keep fighting back at the culture that tries to silence us . But they wont stop us, as long as they keep trying, we fight âœŠðŸ‘Š #standtogether #breakthesilence #standinsolidarity #nomeansno  #itsnotweaktospeak #thursdaysinblack #protest #overit #humanrights #reality #shityoushouldknow #metoo #consent #violence #sexualviolence #activist #activism #brockturner #angry #mentalhealthawareness #ptsd #anxiety

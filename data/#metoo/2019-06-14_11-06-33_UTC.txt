We want everyone to know the whole truth about sexual assault, so educating victims, the public and prospective jurors is a big part of our mission. The unfortunate reality is that many perpetrators of sexual assault are family members or relatives. As isolated as you may feel, youâ€™re not alone in your experience. If your perpetrator was a family member, starting the healing process can be intimidating, but start anyway. Find someone you trust and start sharing your story with them.

Listen, I'm sorry for the injustices, the meanness, the ill-treatment. 
I get it.  I've been #churchHurt too. Not only as a #member but as a #pastor as well.

Here's the thing, my #Relationship with #God didn't lessen, it got deeper! 
You have to learn to depend on God. Men may fail. Leaders may disappoint you but never let it affect your relationship with #Yeshua 
Still dealing with the fallout? DM for #prayer and check the link for info on scheduling yourself for a free 15-min Encounter Session. 
Let's get past this and get to your #purpose .

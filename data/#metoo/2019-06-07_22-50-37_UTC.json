I GET TO CLAIM MY OWN FUCKING IDENTITY. \u2063  TW:s/a \u2063\nThe posts popping up on so many lovely humans\u2019 feeds about claiming your own identity have me feelin all the feels these days. \u2063\n\u2063\nSix years ago, the first woman I dated told me that dating women was a \u201cphase\u201d for me because I am an \u201cassaulted lesbian.\u201d As Maddy explained to me, an assaulted lesbian is a woman who has been assaulted by men and finds safety and security in the arms of women. \u2063\n\u2063\nNewsflash to Maddy: I\u2019ve been assaulted by two of my female partners. Sexual violence does not discriminate. \u2063\n\u2063\nIn my experience, the impact of the first intimate relationship with a woman cannot be understated. I was just out, attempting to find love in myself for the parts I\u2019d resented before, and dealing with the commotion of understanding myself while simultaneously trying to help others in my life understand me. It was exhausting. So when Maddy called me an \u201cassaulted lesbian,\u201d I took it. What this very \u201cexperienced\u201d lesbian said about my identity must be true. I was a \u201cfake lesbian\u201d trying on a new identity. \u2063\n\u2063\nThat phrase, \u201cassaulted lesbian,\u201d still takes the air from my lungs. There is no such thing as an assaulted lesbian. It is one of the most demeaning, undermining, hurtful, and bigoted labels I\u2019ve received, and through all of my transformation, it haunts me. \u2063\n\u2063\nSix years later, I wish I could tell Maddy that her words were inappropriate and dismissing. \u2063\n\u2063\nMy love for Chloe was not constructed from the hands of my perpetrators. Our emotional and physical intimacy is not filling a chasm that my traumas left empty. Chloe is my room and space to heal.\n\u2063\nI am not an assaulted lesbian.\u2063\n\u2063\nI am a lesbian who has been assaulted. \u2063\n\u2063\nI am a lesbian. \u2063\n\u2063\nI am a survivor. \u2063\n\u2063\nThose identities mingle within my everyday life, but they are by no means a single derogatory label. \u2063\n\u2063\nI was born this way. \u2063\n\u2063\nNot molded this way by the hands of perpetrators. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063 \u2063\n#tbtn #lesbiansurvivor  #survivor #loveislove #metoo #lgbt #30daysofgay #pride #equality #sexualassaultawareness"

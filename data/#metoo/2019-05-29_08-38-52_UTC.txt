Misophonia is the hatred or dislike of sound.  It is characterized by sensitivity to specific sounds accompanied by emotional distress,  intense anger, as well as behavioral responses such as avoidance and violence

According to “Psytrillogy Today”  people with Misophonia interpret these sounds as deliberate acts of terror, a war on their peace of mind, and the fastest way for someone to be punched in the face, left at a lunch table, and/or hung up on. .

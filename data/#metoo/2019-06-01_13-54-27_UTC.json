Again, a child becoming victims after falling in unreclaimed coal mine pits. Although she rushed to IA Moeis General Hospital, Natasya's life was not helped, she became one of 34 victims East Kalimantan coal mine holes and 117 victims in the past 4 years throughout Indonesia because 3033 holes in coal mines were gaping and poisonous.\n-\nNatasya Aprilia is still in grade 4 elementary school, she was killed in a coal mine hole that was left without reclamation near the residential area, the gaping hole of the mine was only 2 kilometers from the house of the closest residents in Simpang Pasir village, Palaran sub-district, Samarinda.  The holes without ban boards, no security posts and no fences, even though residents have complained for a long time and asked for the hole to be closed.\n-\nNatasya followed 2 victims of other children who were also victims in this same area of \u200b\u200bthe company. Previously in 2012, Maulana Mahendra (11th) was also killed in a mine pit around the area, as well as in 2016, Muhammad Arham (5th) who died after his body burned due to falling. He accompanied his father working in a pile of hot coal which was scattered due to the management of a bad post-mining area by PT Insani Bara Perkasa, the mining area became a field for killing children.\n-\nThe mine pit case has become an important question at the presidential debate yesterday, but until now the government has not made a serious effort, we are really worried and very anxious that victims continue to grow whose victims are small children as recorded by documentaries currently viral, Sexy Killers.\n-\nFor more information follow @jatamnas\n-\n-\n#femicide #femicidio #metoo #sayhername #NiUnaMenos #1Jfeminista #28M #GerakBersama"

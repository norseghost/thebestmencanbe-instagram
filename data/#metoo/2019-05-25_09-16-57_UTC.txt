There’s a lot about this that doesn’t sit right with me. First of all the trivialising of rape and deciding to focus more on the fact that Kate and William met at St Andrews than the victim or the event. There’s a hint of comparison between this female being victimised at the fashion show and Kate who “caught William’s eye” at the fashion show herself. Putting something as disgusting as rape at a university side by side and comparable to the story of two young students meeting just doesn’t feel right and doesn’t give the victim her due respect.

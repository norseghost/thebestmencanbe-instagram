Donezos! I'm so grateful to have spent this week with such inspiring people, in a totally inclusive, supportive and accessible space - this is rare. Today was full of enlightening convos around Me Too, solidarity with sex workers, the amazing grassroots organizations that have grown from Vancouver, and of course, the icing on the feminist cake, @jodywilsonraybould showed up to put a fire in our bellies 🔥🍰♥️🙌 I'm exhausted and so happy

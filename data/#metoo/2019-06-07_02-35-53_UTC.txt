Got it done today, 3 brutally hot miles with my favorite sidekick, it’s kind of disheartening somedays to see how the humidity slows me down so much but I’m doing the damn thing! I’m proud of myself and I’ll keep pushing myself.. and the fluids ☀️🔥👏🏼🎊 FORWARD IS A PACE, just keep going (but don’t pass out 😂)

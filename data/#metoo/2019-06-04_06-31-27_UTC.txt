MARINA ABRAMOVIÄ† published a letter to her dear friend Jan Fabre on Facebook right after the accusation of sexual harassment against him, saying: "Dear Jan, I know you are going through a very tough period, but one thing that you have to have in front of you of walking the dark tunnel, is that there is always light at the end. The light that guides you and me and all of us artists is art. 
A good work of arts has many lives and never dies." AMAZING!

This is my aunt Bib.  She’s made every birthday and every graduation.  She’s loaned me money, helped me out of jams, covered for me, and has always been one of my biggest fans.  And yes, she might’ve let me see the movie Scarface when I was way too little 🤷🏽‍♂️, but she’s pretty much one of the best human beings on the planet.  She’s hella funny, smart, she don’t take no mess, and she’s been openly gay for as long as I can remember. .

Our family is a HUGE ally for the LGBTQ community so we’ve never had a problem giving her the kind of love and support she truly deserves.  But even with that, her journey has been a difficult one.  Growing up a Latina in South LA trying to navigate her way to accept who she truly is and knowing that she wouldn’t always get the acceptance from others must’ve been incredibly hard.  She has experienced societal pressures and even cultural pressures from some of her very own people that literally had her fighting for her life.  No, I don’t pretend to know her experience on any level.  There’s no way I can.  But what I do know is that there are many people out there like my aunt Bib, who share the same kind of stories...stories of struggle, stories of resilience, and stories of fight.  But please know this...your stories and your lives are an inspiration. You make me wanna be better.  Thank you 🙌🏾 #pridemonth💜❤️🧡💛💚💙

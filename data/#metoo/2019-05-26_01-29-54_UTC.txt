Suicidal feelings are not the same as giving up on life. Suicidal feelings often express a powerful and overwhelming need for a different life. These feelings can mean, in a desperate and unyielding way, a demand for something new. Listen to someone suicidal and youâ€™ll often hear a need for change so important, so indispensable, that they would rather die than go on living without change. And when the person feels powerless to make that change happen, they become suicidal.

I hate what happens here. A 5 month old baby animal! So similar to a dog and even smarter than a dog. The same emotions and consciousness as the dogs we love and protect. Look at her little hoof at the end, the last video. 💔

The story of Jasmin, told by the activist who found her at #meatthevictimsnl :
The room was covered in darkness and sounds of grunts combined with hundreds of feet on the plastic floor. Only a spot of light at the end of the hallway was revealing the individuals responsible for the noise. Even though crowded, they were curious and they were moving around. This was the time we saw her - lying on the floor, unable to move while the others were eating her alive and violently spasming with meningitis. She was looking around in terror with her only eye, too weak to even scream.

Driven by her helplessness, we got her out trying to minimize her suffering and at that moment decided to negotiate for saving her life. The negotiations were going on for hours and for a while it seemed as if she had a chance to make it out of that hell that she was born into. Without any reasoning the police decided at the last moment to deny that for her, so we had to leave Jasmin behind.

Born to be killed, she will most probably die in agony like some of her sisters and brothers we saw. To kill an animal unnecessarily is cruel and violent. Until law recognises this fact we promise Jasmin we won’t stop. Until every cage is empty.

❗ 1 in 3 women have experienced gender-based violence and harassment in the workplace.  But there is still no international law against it. 🙅🏾‍♀️Right now, trade unions, women’s groups and international movements are working to change this. 🤝 In just 2 weeks, the Australian Government will vote on a new international convention at the International Labour Conference that aims to end violence and harassment in the world of work. 👩🏽‍⚖️All women deserve to work in safety. Sign the petition today urging the Government to back the ILO Convention. Link in bio! #AllWomenWork

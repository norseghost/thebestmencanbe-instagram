This is a compilation of various news sources describing the events that occurred last night in London, where a lesbian couple were attacked and beaten because they refused to kiss on the men’s demand, for their enjoyment. This hasn’t been covered much in the community yet and so I hope it will. For this to happen in Pride Month just shows why we still need it. It makes me sick. • #lgbtq #queer #lesbian #bisexual #gay #womenempowerment #feminism #metoo #pridemonth

#shameful Posted @withrepost • @agirlhasnopresident So, I was sent this post by a follower and after a busy day, I spent some time looking into it. I read and re-read the post several times and I spent some time reading and coming back and re-reading the comments, finally, at some point, even one watered down comment from the company. But still, I looked into the company, and even some of the employees, and even those at the corporate office, which is right here in Nashville. I low key know one of the ppl listed on the corporate site, but I’m gonna let that go for now, as it’s very low key and it’s irrelevant. Anyhoo, I think these shirts that @ilovejuicebar is asking their employees to wear are ridiculous! They’re something you’d expect to see a cocktail waitress wearing with a pair of hot pants and roller skates in the late 70s. In the #MeToo era, have we not moved past this? “Squeeze me?” Are you seriously asking for your employees to be man handled and perhaps even sexually assaulted? What will the company do the first time a man grabs the thighs of a woman (because that’s what’s pictured on these shirts) working in their store? Will the company stand behind them, defend them? These shirts don’t make me think that will be the case. When an entire staff walks out, a company needs to ask itself, why. Sure, these shirts are not the only reason, as made clear by this post, but damn, READ IT! Take it seriously! You’ve got a WOMAN AS YOUR CEO!! Shes also the CEO of Vui’s Kitchen @vuiskitchen which I know well. This is 2019, not 1976! Treat women better than this and listen to them when they’re telling them that that’s not what you’re doing! Yes, profits are important, but if that’s all you care about, instances like this will show that.

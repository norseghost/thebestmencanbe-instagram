Why we all are so curious to know about what others are doing with their lives why donâ€™t we just sit on our thrones and play our role in the world? There are a lot many whys in everyoneâ€™s life but we are unable to find the answers just because we have been taught to stay quite even if we have the ability to speak, we are asked to close our eyes even though everyone is watching and know that something is wrong, we are urge to divert our paths just because LOG KYA KAHAIN GAY? And just because of this mind set this society is suppressing us & ultimately we all will loose our identities. Let us all learn the meaning of real DEMOCRAT & let the world know the power of being democratic.

My question is being humans no matter from which religion we belong to. Do we have any right to molest the people around us? To ruin someoneâ€™s childhood to drag someone to a point where nothing but death is the last option left for them?

Reading newspapers, signing petitions, mourning upon incidents, taking rallies out are more than enough? Are we united as a nation? NO.

We are complaining we are fighting but the ones who are supposed to take notice are still sitting in their air conditioned rooms waiting for another zainab to die.

We still have time we can bring change we can show that we as a nation are united and such monsters are not amongst us and should be hanged till death not only twice but thrice. .

A Mother’s Love:

My Mother is the only mother that’ll teach her son to wash, cook, and clean so he don’t have to rely on a woman then come wash, cook, and clean for him like he don’t know how lol! 
Oh, the bag doesn’t contain a dead body...it’s dirty towels traveling 500 miles for her to wash (got my car smelling like wet ass soup 😜). Love thy mother as thy self 🥰⭐️

When one of the ugliest parts of your past comes for an unwelcome visit... I am totally beside myself at the moment!! I have no idea what response this person was expecting from me! I'm putting this out there because there are people who know this man and think of him in a high light. Not from my perspective, and I'm so pissed at the gall of him reaching out in my direction at all, much less friend requesting me!!! I was under the age of 10 when he was doing unspeakable shit to me, and my parents and his continued over and over again to leave him to babysit us three girls while they went out. And when I got old enough to realize that the "special attention" I was getting was wrong and I told my mother, she told me I was exaggerating and nothing was ever said or done, I assume out of the discomfort of it all on their friendships. I'm all kinds of wonky over this and I want people to know that know us both!! This was wrong of him to contact me... And back then what he was doing was worse. Best part is that we have no mutual friends, so he's looking me up! Listen to victims when they speak. Believe them!! #metoo

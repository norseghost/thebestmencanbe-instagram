See what people are saying about Candy Apple Butterscotch, #newauthor Rebecca MacCeile’s debut publication. “This is an impactful read if you have ever experienced any sort of abuse. I appreciate the author’s candor and willingness to write with such openness. She takes responsibility for herself as much as she describes the lasting effects of trauma.” “It is WORTH THE READ. It’s about a woman empowered and, my God, that is a wonderful thing indeed.” “The author gets to the point while still painting a very clear and definite picture for the readers and I love that. The accounts of the trauma are laid out in such a way that you know what’s happening and are able to imagine it but you aren’t bombarded with intense graphic imagery, which I appreciate as a survivor myself. Would definitely recommend!” “This amazingly written gem takes you inside the author’s world and keeps you there, making you feel like a discreet “bug on the wall.” I could not put it down.” “I wish everyone would write a memoir. It would be so much easier to understand people. I haven’t been through anything as violent or traumatic, but I think this story is relatable in a lot of ways. It just makes me see a lot of things differently in every day life. It’s a big eye opener.” #onsalenow at the #linkinbio. #kindle and #paperback versions available!

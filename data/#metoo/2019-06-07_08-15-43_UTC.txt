Contentment? 
Philippians 4:11-13
 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be CONTENT IN WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.  I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.  I can do all this through him who gives me strength.

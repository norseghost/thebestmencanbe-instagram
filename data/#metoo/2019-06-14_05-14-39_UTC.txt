Traumatic childhoods often result in a loss of the self. I was forced to serve the needs of my abusers for so long. My self was deeply buried so that I could stay safe. Uncovering, reclaiming, and rejoicing in my new found sense of self is new for me...and very exciting! Can you relate? How have you come to find and free yourself? .

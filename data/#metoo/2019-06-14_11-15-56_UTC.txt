Every rapist, paedophile, drug addict, alcoholic, abusive partner, robber and murderer has an untold story of pain, abuse, abandonment and neglect. Boys who grow up to be violent men are mostly guided by personal traumatic experiences. In order to reduce the menace of abuse meted on women and girls, it is imperative for society to pay kin attention to men’s mental health.

Thank you Omotoso Temmy, Angel Dammy, Ojo Temitope, Olaide Tomilola, Amusan Temitope and Bamidele Inioluwa for your selfless service and sacrifice.

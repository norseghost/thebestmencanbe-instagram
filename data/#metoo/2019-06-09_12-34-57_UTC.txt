One of the biggest gifts you can give yourself while you’re going through your divorce is to put your focus on someone who really needs your help. Stay with me here and why this is relevant: when we focus on someone who desperately needs help, we take the focus off our lives and all the work you’re doing for someone else puts EVERYTHING into perspective. Then you start to map out your goals and dreams and get to work. When we’re stuck in our situation, it can tend to feel like it’s the end of the world, but it’s not. It’s just for right now. And when you’re dealing with a toxic partner, all you’re dealing with is work, trying to manage the kids and that toxic person you used to be married to...it’s easy to get lost in it all. When you’re focusing on someone who is worse off than you, then you can start to see how less difficult your situation really is and you can start to pursue your dreams with certainty and some emotional intelligence. *

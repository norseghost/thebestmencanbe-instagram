An American Marriage by Tayari Jones. Winner of this year's Women's Prize for Fiction and our last book club book; this novel discusses multiple issues (including mass incarceration and consent) in a sensitive way, and to some extent mirrors the complexity of real life. However, I found it difficult to empathise with Celestial, and I really disliked the ending. Has anyone else read it? What did you think?

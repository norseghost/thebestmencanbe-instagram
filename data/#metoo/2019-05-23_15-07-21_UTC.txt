When I was 19, I wrote a letter exposing my abuser to some family members that didn’t know already, hoping to protect other possible victims. It was one of the hardest things I have ever done. I had a friend come over with a cake 🎂 and said “these kind of days, you need to eat cake with your hands.” To this day, that was one of my favorite ways I was supported.  Safe people help heal you more than they realize, even if it’s just to eat cake together with your 👋🏼 after a hard day.

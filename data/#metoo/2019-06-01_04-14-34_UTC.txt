Last night I went to a vigil for a girl who was brutally murdered in my city a week ago. Hundreds of us gathered in the rain at the site of her death and stood for an hour keeping vigil for her. 
Courtney Herron is the 20th woman to be killed in Australia in 2019 alone. The violence against women in this city is reaching an epidemic, it seems to just be getting worse in what is considered a “safe country”. I’m starting to feel unsafe in my home. I’ve never felt scared to be a woman in Melbourne but these days I worry that myself or one of my friends, or a girl I met once at uni or on the train, is going to be next. There seems to be no way of avoiding this violence; a lot of these women took the proper precautions that were taught (Cross the road, walk on main streets only, no headphones, etc.) and they still end up murdered. Some of these women are killed by strangers, others by their husbands and partners. This fear is real and apparent no matter what your relationship status is. 
I’m so angry for Courtney and all the other women who have been killed, and I’m scared for myself and those still living here. Standing vigil last night in the park where a vulnerable woman was bashed and killed really made me count just how many vigils I’ve been to in the last year. I’m meant to be living in a safe area, yet it feels anything but.

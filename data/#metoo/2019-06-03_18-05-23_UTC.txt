BENT & UNBROKEN

#metoo as a part 
Of the scars on my heart
My naked truth In Kintsugi art

Even though you hurt my soul
I want you to know, in order to grow
I’ll  accept and forgive to let go

It took oceans of tears
To get rid of the labels, convictions and fears
I kept with me for all these years

Often wished I could rewind the time
To unchain myself, delete my mind
From all the hurt, blame & shame
That I carried with me, like my name

I no longer let my future 
Be dominated by my past
In order to make progression
I’ll value myself by using compassion
Finally loving myself at last

I’ll have the courage to walk straight
Heal my wounds and fears with faith
With forgiveness, setting me free
No more insecurities

I am bigger than pain, 
I am stronger than shame

Sending kisses to rejection 
In the form of resurrection

Yes I do
 #iloveme too

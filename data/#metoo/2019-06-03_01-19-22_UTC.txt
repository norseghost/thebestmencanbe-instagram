Why do I need feminism? 
Because in kindergarten, a teenager ran his fingers through my butt to "teach me a lesson." Why do I need feminism? 
Because in second grade, when a boy punched me, the teacher told me it was because he liked me. 
Why do I need feminism? 
Because in ninth grade, when the boys at camp tried to spy through the girl's bunk window while we were showering, we were told "they were just being boys." Why do I need feminism? 
Because in tenth grade, the symptoms of my diagnosed disease were brushed off as being "womanly hysteria." Why do I need feminism? 
Because everyday, all around the world, women are put down. They are brushed off, beaten, and even murdered. 
Why am I feminist? 
To change the fucking world. .

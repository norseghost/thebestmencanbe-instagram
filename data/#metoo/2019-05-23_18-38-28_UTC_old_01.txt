I really think this is where the disconnect comes from .

Credit to @www_datvegasgyrl_com : After conversing with another person about women taking compliments as harrassment, I felt I needed to share this .

COMPLIMENTS OF A PHYSICAL AND PERSONAL NATURE HAVE NO PLACE IN THE WORKPLACE OR WITH YOUR COWORKERS .

If you don't understand why, good luck in life .

#MeToo .

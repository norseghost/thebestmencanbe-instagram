I have always wanted to be featured on PopMatters and today that dream comes true! Thank you to Ryan Scott Lathan for writing something my mama is proud to read, something that I am so proud to read 🙌🏼 Check out the latest review of FIRE GOES TO DIE 🔥 .

“...there have been many courageous female artists over the years whose artistic strength and integrity lie in their willingness to be open, vulnerable, and fiercely outspoken. "Fire Goes to Die" may be Michelle Vezilj's debut single, but it should be mentioned in the same regard, and it heralds the arrival of a singular talent whose take-no-prisoners approach to tackling uncomfortable subject matter, regardless of the consequence is admirable.“ @writerrye @popmatters .

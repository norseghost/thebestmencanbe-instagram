                        "text": "\ud83c\udf0a\nThere was a time in my life when I was in the midst of puberty and was obsessed with losing weight. I used to starve myself, exercise like crazy, and became a walking calories calculator. I managed to shed 10kg in 3 months. Plus, the what seemed to be harmless habit of Indonesians saying \u201cyou\u2019ve gain weight\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ve lost weight\u201d when they have not seen me after some time did hurt me. It\u2019s the one thing about Indonesians that I wasn\u2019t proud of.\n\u2022\nIn 2013, I had a revelation about God\u2019s love for me. I could vividly hear Him in my heart \u201cwhy do you hurt yourself when I love you for who you are? Your body is my temple\u201d. I was in a journey in discovering God\u2019s love. What I discovered took my breath away and I had few opportunities to share it on stage with many girls and even adults.\n\u2022\nToday, I\u2019m happy with who I am, what I have become, and comfortable with my own body despite my big arms and thigh I was born with\ud83d\ude02. I eat whatever I feel like eating without feeling guilty or even count the calories in it. I\u2019m so happy to see my generation today embracing the \u201cnon Victoria Secret body\u201d or curviness and encouraging other women who are suffering from body image and anorexia.\n\u2022\nGirls, your health and happiness is the key, not the number. Embrace who you are, lose weight if you need to, but never, never, starve yourself or hurt yourself. Do it the right way, the healthy and safe way. Nonetheless, you are beautiful no matter what your skin colour or body type is. Don\u2019t let them define you\ud83d\udc95\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#feminist #feminism #bodypositive #bodytransformation #beconfident #ambassadorsearch #followforfollowback #outfitoftheday #followforlike #likeforlikes #singapore #singapore\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec #summer #summervibes #yacht #yachtparty #inspirationalquotes #quotestoliveby #metoo #coachella #relatablequotes #relatable"

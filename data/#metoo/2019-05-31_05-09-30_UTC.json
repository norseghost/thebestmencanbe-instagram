                        "text": "At least 138 government officials, in both elected and appointed positions, have been publicly reported for sexual harassment, assault, misconduct or violence against women since the 2016 election, according to an analysis. \nThree in every four of these officials have left or been ousted from their positions. But as many as 33 will remain in office by January. \nMost of the accused officials in these findings have since fallen from power. Of the 25 appointed officials, 23 have been fired or resigned. Of the 111 elected officials reported, 76 are no longer in office. \nWhat\u2019s more, some of these officials also face legal action, including seven civil lawsuits and 12 criminal charges. This type of accountability is historically unprecedented. \nNonetheless, of the 27 government officials accused of sexual misconduct who ran for office in this year\u2019s midterm elections, 23 were reelected or elected to a new government position. \nU.S. laws don\u2019t adequately protect the many women who suffer sexual harassment or misconduct at the hands of less visible men. Harassment laws don\u2019t protect domestic workers, independent contractors, interns and those working for small employers. \nOn the upside, the data show that in 2018, officials introduced 281 bills in support of gender equity and ending harassment in state legislatures across nearly all 50 states. There were 22 bills introduced in U.S. Congress."

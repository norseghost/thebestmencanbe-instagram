You can delay your case with BS supeonas, continue to avoid the courtroom, threaten insta bloggers in their DMs, but all it does is show how guilty you really are. Your victims' voices have been heard by an army of supporters. First it's a sign on a house, then it's a petition, we can do more....billboards, skywriting, start q petition to remove your father's name from the Ravenel Bridge, show up at the courthouse and support your (alleged) victims. Like Ashley, we're not going anywhere ðŸ–• #TimesUpTrav .

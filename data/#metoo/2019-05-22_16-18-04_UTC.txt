The NYC Garment District. I love you, I hate you. The number of times I've been screamed at for nothing, cursed at, thrown things at, or sexually harassed at work are innumerable. Or how about working till 1am each day and still 1099 status after nine months? What about the blatant racism as my boss instructed me not to interview black people?!! WTF?!! After which I hired a black person. On my last interview here I broke out in a rash in anticipation of the bad treatment to come. #realtalk No more!! News flash: fashion employees are dying to work hard for a fair boss. Here's to starting a company that puts people and employees first, and is truly equal opportunity for all genders, ethnicities, and identities. ðŸ¥‚

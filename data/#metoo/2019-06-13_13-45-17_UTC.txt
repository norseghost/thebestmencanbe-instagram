Gentilly Airbnb refuge the morning after. A quiet, safe, welcoming place to starfish in bed is all I wanted last night. Will do this again at another Airbnb tonight somewhere else, then off to Dallas Friday - Monday for work. When I return begins the work of putting my new home together at last. ❤️A safe, nurturing home where I can thrive is a concept I would like to know as a reality someday; a place not owned by shitty landlords, where no one can throw me out, abuse me, neglect me, gaslight me, financially manipulate me, or dehumanize me. A place where I am always welcome, heard, & where my needs matter. I already took my power back by recently breaking my lease & leaving my last place where my landlord let the electricity not work for over a month & then refused to reimburse me & tried to gaslight me into putting up with his constant bullshit, so that is a step in the right direction. I don’t have parents who support me or even care whether I am alive or dead based on zero attempts on their part to check on me since 2014 (one is dead, so he admittedly has an excuse, and my stepfather in his cowardice and alcoholism ghosted me after my father died—he is no parent of mine), so it makes it even more critical to my survival to make sure I have a safe, nurturing, & abuse-free home—something my parents could never give me. My mother divorced my father to escape her abuse, but she never fought for sole custody and still allowed my primary abuser access to my mind, body, and soul. I gave up a long time ago any hope that she would see her role in generational trauma & that she would apologize for her own years of abuse & gaslighting that she put me through. Instead, she hides behind the lies she tells to others about me, painting me as some sort of twisted villain when I am simply her daughter who she failed to protect. I know I am an extraordinary human being worthy of unconditional love even if my own parents never understood that. I have never felt truly safe in any home, but I still deserve to feel that feeling of safety, and I will have it. I will make sure of that. 💪🏽👑🌈 #survivor #metoo #healing #qtpoc

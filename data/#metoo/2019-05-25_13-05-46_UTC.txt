The reason why I still stand is because I libe in my future generations. My life is not about me is about preparing the path for the future me. I am my childrenâ€™s keeper . I had to take the stand and asked God to allow me to intercept for them. Yahweh is a God of order. It is not normal neither natural to take a mans stand. I woman has a role , but as I do both , I asked for mercy from Him. I will stand  until I am blessed with a man who will honour us . For I know my future generations will not inherit my mistakes they will inherit my prosperity and blessings. #successfulwomen #power #growthmindset #god #happy #entrepreneur #life #loveyourself #strong #powerfulquotes #christianwoman #confidenceboost #femaleempowerment #queen #mybeautifulmess #bornagain #singlemorher #warfare #womenentrepreneurs #prayerlife #personaldevelopment #metoo #repost #inspire #empowerment #business #yaweh #inspirational #selflove #liveyourbestlife

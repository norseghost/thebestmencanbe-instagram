For you Americans, Grenfell was a fire in an apartment block- warning signs were ignored by the local council and government, and May basically did nothing substantial to help the victims (they were inner city people, a large group of whom were immigrants and refugees.) They’re still not all housed, and the government still hasn’t taken the necessary action to change other apartment blocks to prevent the same happening. Solidarity with the victims of Grenfell, forever in our hearts. #berniesanders #freepalestine #capitalism #maga #eu #theresamay #brexit #socialist #blacklivesmatter #feminism #feminist #equality #metoo #lgbt #lgbtq #humanrights #sjw #trump #republican #democrat #tommyrobinson #unitedireland #communism #ilhanomar #islam #aoc #guncontrol #handsoffvenezuela

The trailer looks awesome! @hrithikroshan has done a fantastic job. Hopefully, it gets released successful amid various allegations! Actress Taapsee Pannu says people must not stop raising their voice against sexual harassment at workplace and continue the #MeToo movement. Her comment comes just two days after director Vikas Bahl was given a clean chit after an allegation of sexual misconductmade against him by a former employee of the now disbanded Phantom Films, was probed, and his credit as director ofSuper 30 was restored.

‼️FOOTAGE FROM SUDAN‼️
i have no words for what i have just seen. usually, i try not to post distressing content, however i feel it’s important that everybody knows what’s going on. you can read about it, hear about it, tell people about it...but the severity of the situation doesn’t quite hit you until you’ve seen it. 
please share this. we need more awareness and media coverage.
this breaks my heart.

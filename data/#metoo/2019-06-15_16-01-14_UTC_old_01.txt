Seeing this picture🙌🏾. 2012 was the year God really showed himself. The Navy was trying to medically retire me because I couldn't run or exercise after a surgery they did in 2010. They sent me to different hospitals and tried to redo what had happened. I had gotten to a place where I couldn't even walk. I was going through but I wasn't going down without a FIGHT💪🏾💯. Looking back, it was all intentional. I wouldn't be where I am today without the battles I had to fight and WIN to get here. Every fight was worth it. Every tear was worth it. Every struggle was worth it. Every moment of asking God "why" makes since NOW. I smiled through my pain. I praised through my pain. God blessed me even in my "going through". If you feel like you are in a dark place. If you are feeling like you want to quit. If you feel as though God is not there. I want you to know that you need to just continue praising your way through and God will meet you on the other side. He is there even when you feel like He is not. He is there even when you feel like you cant see Him. KEEP PRESSING, KEEP PRAYING, KEEP PRAISING.❤

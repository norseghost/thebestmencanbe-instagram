We often cling to past pains because we don’t feel fully witnessed. We keep returning unconsciously to the same experiences of wounding, not fully understanding why the same pain keeps getting recreated. We don’t feel like we can move on into a better world if no one understands what we’ve been through. We get so obsessed with the story of how it’s been, rather than focusing on how it IS & how it can be. ⁣

For years I was this way — waiting for people to fully “get” me before I started truly living. The burden of my past traumas felt insurmountable. Until finally I took the same relentless optimism & militant self-protection that had kept me alive thus far and channeled it into not just surviving but actually living a life beyond my wildest dreams. Until finally I decided to stop externally seeking & to instead internally validate myself, through deep subconscious reprogramming. And then suddenly the world started to validate me too (it’s almost like we live in a vibrational universe where the external mirrors the internal! 😍) Turns out, I had more love than I even realized - when you’re running a “no one gets me” program, you can’t even see the connection right in front of you.⁣

When I look at the explosive nature of online callouts these days, I see the legacy of our unexpressed rage and unwitnessed pain. I see all of us carrying so much we never said, so much that was not acknowledged, in our own lives and in our ancestors’ lives too. And we finally have a bit of a social context for that expression and acknowledgement. So it’s all coming out. ⁣

Which is ultimately a good thing, if we know how to ride the waves and seize the moment for the highest good. If we hold a vision beyond perpetual triggers, if we do stand strong & do not turn away from what is coming up, if we extend true compassion to all who are suffering. And yes, even those who you don’t believe or you feel like could be a little nicer in how they’re expressing themselves. ⁣

We have the opportunity to be time-traveling alchemists, embodying the frequency of the future in the present moment, and watching the world reorganize itself back to our birthright of peace and connection.

The Power Talk panel is an open transparent discussion about the
uncomfortable topic Sexual Abuse/Assault.  The panel consists of
advocates and survivors who bring a supportive and caring approach to
explore all options and rights through empowerment and discussion. The
event will give the wounded the opportunity to leave healed. Give
voice to our silence and strength to our weakness. You do not have to be a survivor to attend. Understand that sexual abuse happens to 1/3 women and 1/6 men. It could have been you, god forbid it happens to your child, niece or nephew.

Letâ€™s talk about it At the 2nd annual Powertalk Sunday, June 23, 2019 from 5:30pm- 9:00pm as we discuss our testimonies, struggles, and road to healing in hopes of strengthening the fight against sexual abuse! âœ¨

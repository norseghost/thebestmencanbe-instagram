In most cases, psychopaths are obsessed with making sure that they break up with you. This is a sign of power & control.
.
When the psychopath is the one who’s discarded, you should prepare yourself for months—if not years—of stalking and harassment. Until they find another victim, they will pour all of their rage into ruining your life.
.
They may also try to win you back. Don’t be fooled. This is their final manipulative attempt to turn the tables—so that the dumping can occur on their terms.
.
They put their newest target on display because they want you to know about him/ her. They’re waiting for your reaction.
. . . . . 
I’ve heard from 100’s of you over the years (sorry I can’t get back to everyone’s DM)... and I’ve heard all the stories. They all sound like this. ALL OF THEM.  And in the beginning, MYSELF INCLUDED, it appears they give their new supply everything YOU always wanted. They appear happy. In love. She gets everything you wanted. They may even get engaged!!! Married!! Even have babies! My ex can play this role for years. But that’s all it is. A role. An act. .
Narcissists do not change. Not now. Not ever. .

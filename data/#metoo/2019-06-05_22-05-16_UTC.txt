I’m excited for you all to hear this interview series that took place at @unconventional_shell event entitled “Intimate Conversations: The Culture Affects All”. I was able to interview Shellsy and 4 other black women on their experience with sexual violence and their take on how to heal and why it is the way it is. It was an amazing event and I hope hearing these women’s stories will impact you. #theinimitableblackwoman

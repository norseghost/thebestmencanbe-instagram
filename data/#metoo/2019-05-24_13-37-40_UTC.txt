TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️
.
“When survivors of childhood sexual abuse get close to having their own kids, their trauma can manifest more intensely” - that’s what my shrink told me.
.
Until therapy, I didn’t remember my childhood at all... and I thought it was because I grew up as a type 1 diabetic... but through therapy, I learned why I had such an angry and defensive attitude my whole life. I realized...
.
Why I couldn’t remember anything.
.
Why I was always afraid someone would take advantage of me.
.
Why I couldn’t connect with other kids.
.
Why id starve myself then eat everything in sight.
.
Why I was raped two more times as an adult (Survivors tend to have repeat attacks throughout adolescence) and blamed myself. I didn’t even call it rape... I just thought I brought it on myself.
.
Why I rebelled and chose to ignore my illnesses, cut myself instead of seek help, feel disappointed every day I woke up again, why I’d fight anyone who I loved out of fear they world hurt or leave me... why I never let myself get close to or trust adults - including my parents who just thought I was an angry person.
.
I was 4 when that monster first said to me, “if you tell mommy and daddy they’ll think you’re disgusting too and leave you. You only have me.”
.
I was 7 when I almost died. I hid being sick from my mom because she was pregnant and having a difficult time. I didn’t want any attention.... to me, I didn’t deserve any attention. I just needed to see my baby sister. So I hid being sick until I almost died... right after my baby sister was born and I was able to see her.
.
I was 7, so sick, and remember that monster making me pee in the street (I was in DKA and dying... I couldn’t hold my pee any more) as he laughed at me and called me a dog as I cried. He abused me for another year and then I was safe... from him. What I didn’t realize is how hard it would continue to make life until...
.
I was 28 when I decided to stop resenting my past and start valuing the strong woman, loving mother, and fierce protector of women that I was destined to become as a result...& he’ll never take that away from me.

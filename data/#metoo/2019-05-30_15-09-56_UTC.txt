To take ourselves towards paradise,
To take our souls to the lost horizon,
To mark our moves in this world,
To have people remember us not for the humans we are but for the artists we thrive to be.
Here's what we are asking you to wait for and much more!
Only 1 day to go! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

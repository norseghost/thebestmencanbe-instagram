May 21, people took to their state house to protest the unfair abortion laws being passed in some states within the country. A lot of people said to me “Why bother going? That’s never going to happen in a progressive state like MA.” I went to stand in solidarity with the women that this bill will affect because if we don’t stand together we don’t matter. I stand with the women of color and women in poverty who this bill is going to affect the most. I stand with trans a non binary people who this will affect too. Reproductive rights are everyone’s rights. 🇨🇴

‚úçüèΩ compliance with an order, request, or law or submission to another's authority.

For years I struggled with being obedient to the voice of God.  It caused a lot of Strife in my life.  I repeated cycles that should‚Äôve ended years ago.  One day I decided to pray for the spirit of obedience because I was tired of myself.  You ever just get tired of yourself?  Well I did!  Although I believed that what I prayed for was already done in the Spiritual rim,  there was things I had to do in the Natural rim to see God Manifested evidence in my life.

I‚Äôm thankful today for the strength that I once didn‚Äôt have.  God is Faithful!!

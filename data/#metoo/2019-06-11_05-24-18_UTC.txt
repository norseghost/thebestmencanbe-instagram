I found footage on #youtube of the #PowerWheels #commercial that I did when I was about 5 years old. It’s so hard, writing my memoir about being a child #actress (mom) and a child prostitute (dad), and seeing how little I was.
.
I remember this shoot being really fun though - a director told me that I had a reputation in the industry for being the child actor who was “good with dogs and animals.” So whenever they needed an All American blonde girl who liked golden retrievers, they called my agent.
.
Watching this @frontlinepbs documentary about child sex trafficking in the county that I was born, supported by the @macfound has really motivated me to get my memoir’s book proposal finished. https://www.pbs.org/video/sex-trafficking-in-america-tptgui/

Guess who is a horrible friend? Yes, you got that right. It's @kamalika_._ (and #meToo). A very very Happy Belated Birthday. I am so sorry I didn't wish you yesterday. I swear I will make up for it (by pulling off a Portia and begging you for mercy and forgiveness till you get annoyed of the leech hanging around your feet and forgive me). Here is a series of picture featuring the coolest girl I know, who has the darkest and sassiest sense of humour (the kind I like best), is the best judge of Game of Thrones characters, is a connoisseur of shallow beauty and deep philosophy and has been the nicest and most relatable friend in my life. Thank you for sharing my passion and love for Marvel  movies, Call Me By Your Name and @kamalika_._ . Come to Calcutta soon and we'll chill without @kamalika_._ and bitch a lot about her. Happy Birthday Gublu!

After the shock wore off, I had to reconstruct my beliefs and relationships from the rubble that remained of my former life. \u2063\n\u2063\nFor a long time, the only relationship I could truly stomach was the one I had with my dog. \ud83d\udc36 I couldn\u2019t give anything to anyone else in my life - I didn\u2019t even believe that I deserved to have a family, if you can believe that. All interactions were transactions to me, and I simply had nothing of value left to offer to anyone. \ud83d\ude14\u2063\n\u2063\nOne day, I realized that I hadn\u2019t looked anyone in the eyes in over a week. \ud83d\udc40 I accidentally met the gaze of a store clerk at checkout, and I burst into tears at the sudden, immediate understanding that I was missing out on my relationship with others, and in turn, myself. \u2063\n\u2063\nI\u2019m still working on being my best, most present Melissa in each interaction I have. It\u2019s hard, but getting so. much. easier. \u263a\ufe0f \u2063\n\u2063\nSometimes it takes something so unspeakably horrible to shake us out of patterns we didn\u2019t know we had. And sometimes it\u2019s not about the event itself, but the path to healing that truly changes us. \u2063\n\u2063\nTo anyone healing from trauma that leaves you feeling disconnected, please know that healing is available to you, and sometimes in the form of the very people you feel that you cannot connect with. \u2063\n\u2063\nIt is possible! Anything is. Love you. #metoo \ud83d\udc95"

Inner dialogue👉🏻 Am I sitting on the couch watching #HarryPotter in the middle of the day because I’m lazy or is it because I have anxiety and PTSD and the world is just too much right now? Or is it because I’m just being lazy? Ugh, I’m so lazy, I never get anything done in a timely manner. I have so many projects that are like 80% - 90% done each needing only a couple of hours to really complete, why can’t I just do it! 🤦🏼‍♀️ Rae, be patient with yourself, be kind to yourself.❤️ Sometimes you just need to escape into and marinate in the land of magic, to remember magic. You are magical, human beings are magical, you are accomplishing so much in this world. You need to give yourself more credit. ❤️❤️❤️ Five minutes later...or am I just lazy?... #yourenotalone #raepublic 👇🏻

“Love note No. 50: I’m proud of you”
.

Who needs to hear this today? .

I’m proud of you for getting out of bed today.

I’m proud of you for saying thank you while looking the person in the eye.

I’m proud of you for trying something new.

I’m proud of you for just trying.

I’m proud of you for braving the wilderness. 
I’m proud of you for becoming who you are meant to be. 
A common phrase we don’t share enough with one another, and especially ourselves. .

This was a commission I was able to do for stellar @feralsilver .  If you’re into jewelry I highly recommend getting your hands on her awesome pieces!

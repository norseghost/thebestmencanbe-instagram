i want to thank the strong women of the world.

this past week i went to DC and the swamp humidity was nothing compared to the lizard people wearing human suits and discussing why food and shoes aren’t a human right.
that’s jokes cause they were women telling me that shit. this battle is hard yo - they peeled back their lips to show all their teeth and laughed in the face of climate crisis.

THEY’RE PLAYING GAMES WITH OUR LIVELIHOODS AND THEY LAUGH TO SHOW US HOW FUNNY IT ALL IS TO THEM ON CAPITOL HILL AND IN THESE INSTITUTIONS.
they will run research studies until the water is all gone. WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE GOING TO DO? i don’t know.

All I’ma say, as a non lizard person, is i can no longer not talk about this. I can no longer just post on my story and let it disappear after 24 hours. i hope i see YOU in these muthafuckin streets yo, cause the revolution is here and it’s strongest when you’re involved and fueling it.

i have a feeling i’ma be seeing the studio less and less...music, while part of my livelihood and identity, is not about streams on spotify or music videos or gigs where i drink and shake my ass. WE ALL GOTTA GIVE UP SOMETHING SO U SHOULD DECIDE NOW BEFORE DISASTER COME AND TAKE IT ALL AND U DIDN’T
HAVE A CHOICE N U WEREN’T READY.

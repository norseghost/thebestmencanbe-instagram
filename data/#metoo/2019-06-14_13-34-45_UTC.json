                        "text": "#DoraMaar is largely exfiltrated from #Picasso at the new, very comprehensive exhibition at the #CentrePompidou, #Paris.  I have been following Dora and her career since I worked on a Picasso documentary for #WNET in conjunction with the Picasso #retrospective after his death and before the #MuseePicasso was finished. At the time, she was very reclusive and reluctant to meet. She had suffered greatly from Picasso\u2019s abusive treatment (Picasso taught me everything I needed to know about #MeToo a long time ago) and had withdrawn into a life of #spirituality and secretiveness. The #exhibition takes us through her varied career as a commercial #photographer, #Surrealist, #painter, and a late return to experimental #photography towards the end of her life. From my perspective, her commercial work is easily on a par with the Surrealist photomontages and demonstrates her playfulness which planted the seeds for the later work.  She was an on set photographer for #Renoir, a #contributor to a theater troupe, and widely #traveled. Alas as soon as Picasso comes into the picture, Dora loses her integrity under the yoke of this powerful man. Her #painting is derivative of his and though he theoretically respected her work, inevitably she lost her will and creative energies with the force of his personality and his genius. She documented the gestation of #Guernica in a famous series of photographs but at the same time he documented her disintegration into a tearful, tragic figure in a famous series of paintings.  Dora played cat and mouse with me, first agreeing to see me, then not. I have her many letters with her beautiful cursive #handwriting as a reminder to forever maintain one\u2019s own work and sources of inspiration."

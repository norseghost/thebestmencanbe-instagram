Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women/Girls is a slow drip genocide, resulted directly from colonization and settler colonialism. We must be aware that settler colonialism and patriarchy are one in the same.  We, as a society and as a nation have to start recognizing that Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women/Girls need be addressed immediately. Moreover, women within the contemporary feminist movement need to prioritize #MMIWG within the #MeToo Movement. Therefore, true intersectional feminism is that of a decolonized mindset.” - pj cantu

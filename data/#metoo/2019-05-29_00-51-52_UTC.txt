Though these ingredients are expensive and I suggest people should definitely swap them out for whatever they feel more comfortable with it takes less of this food to get all the vitamins and minerals your body might be cravin. it's got to be less than the average prices for avocado toast out there which are insane! This will make 8 pieces of more filling, cleaner, and more satiating avocado toast. For comparison's sake the lowest end of avocado toast is generally $6. --- x 8 is $44. Though generally where I live it is $10 or more a piece! Which is exactly why I've never one time purchased it out  Can always add a little lox/salmon, or other protien-fat even though it has plenty.  xo

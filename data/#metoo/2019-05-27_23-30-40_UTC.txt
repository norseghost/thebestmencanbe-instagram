So excited to keep these conversations going! Especially becaise of my guest this Thursday. None other than @candenwebb . We are going to be talking about how she sees her role as a creative, and her art. But mostly I wanna ask about what has it been like being a female in the performing arts space in the church world. Have you ever felt looked over? Have you ever been taken advantage off? What wisdom would you share with up and coming female artist? What could fellas do or not do to allow for more space for females? & more. Be sure to tune in Thursday at 4:00 PM ( PST) or check out the 24 hour replay. Remember always... Be Honest. #writersofinstagram #poetry #bhonest #hooey #metoo #female #art #artist

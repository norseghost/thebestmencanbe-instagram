Your healing is about you...healing your relationship with your past, yourself, and others, healing your broken parts, healing your wounded soul, healing your child-self who did not get what they needed and/or were traumatized...the two words that keep being repeated is healing and YOUR...because it is all about you...
.
How you heal is all about you as well (as long as you don’t go out to hurt others when acting out your pain)...cry and get snot running down your red face, scream, talk, don’t talk, write, take space, ask for hugs, freak-out, etc...everyone heals in their own way and in their own time...and it may be an ongoing battle...how others heal and how they think you should heal should not dictate how you heal or feel about your process...because it’s about you and only you.

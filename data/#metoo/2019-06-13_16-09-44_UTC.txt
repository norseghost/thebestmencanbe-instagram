#MEDICAL #BREAKTHROUGH ‼️‼️‼️ #PMDD was just classified as a gynecological disease- NOT a mood or mental disorder! I am the 1 in 20. Allergic to the rise and fall of estrogen and progesterone, depleting my #serotonin count, making me #suicidal and #angry .  We are not crazy , this isn’t your typical PMS. And thankfully it has now been introduced as a disease and can be properly treated; thankful to #5HTP in the meantime! This is a #genetic #disease but is common among women who have been raped as well #metoo // WHAT A GLORIOUS DAY!!! #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #lifestyle #awareness #aware #blessed #blessing #godisgood #women #thursday #keepmovingforward #dreambig #nevergiveup #singersongwriter #actor #writer #artist #bossbabe #model #lifestyleblogger

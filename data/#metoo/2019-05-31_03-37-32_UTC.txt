In this age of Instagram, watching the young ladies of the James Madison High School Singers and Select Singers sing Radiohead’s Creep takes on a whole new meaning.  Kudos to the director who orchestrated this beautiful rendition.  Hug the young women in your life, for you don’t know the struggle.  #interiorsbylh #radiohead #thomyorke #creep #JMHS #instagram #growingup #girlpower #metoo #bullying #selfdoubt #supportgirls #highschool

Excuse the lateness of my #MomentumMondays post, however the info will HIT all the same trust me!

Over the past YEAR Ive made the hard choice to go underground cut off my visibility as an artist. 
Hard to do as a Businesswoman but whats more important in this self-employed world?? Self-sufficiency or Self-Love/worth?... The real answer is not to choose either or, but choose to learn to BALANCE between the two. Darkness can set in on our lives at any moment without warning!! But if you CONSTANTLY let this inevitability throw off your progress and self-confidence, thats when the darkness gets thicker and harder to fight your way out of thus creating STAGNATION.

Stop doubting your greatness! Even if no one else can see it. Even if you can't believe in the world youre trying to make it in... At least believe in yourself. Pick that head back up yall! We've got work to do. 💪🏾💪🏾 #beatthemondays #momentummondays #buddingceo #foodforthought #motivation #grindtime #freeexpressionz #freelancedesigner #artist #artlife #supportsmallbusiness #followme #starvingartist #blessed #message #blackart #blog #metoo #shoeartist #graphics #faith

I was raped when I was 25.  I did not tell anybody and then when I could not avoid it interfering with my life I gave up.  I gave up hope, I gave up rationality and gave up a will to live.  So I got ill with #mentalillness #mentalhealth #bipolar #bipolardisorder .

This piece of #arttherapy #illustration #drawing #portrait #graphicdesign is a begging bowl.  A crude depiction of how I do not want people to think of #me when I am honest about that.  I don't need your fucking sympathy or pity party.  I need you to buckle your braces and deal with the patriarchy that allows that kind of shit to happen.

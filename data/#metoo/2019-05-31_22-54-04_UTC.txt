I look back on so many times in my life. Times I thought were such a struggle. They were so hard and I was so stressed. I didn't know what to do or how to handle it. Which is why I was stressed.

Once I learned to find tools to deal with the things that happen in life my perspectives begin to change.

I went through some pretty serious traumas in my life.  Some even back-to-back.  I used to look at them as struggles. But as I've grown my perspective has changed.

I now see those times as stair steps to get me to where I'm going.  Those things have made me a better person. I am learning to relax into them.  To take them in stride.

And whatever lies ahead I know I'm more capable of dealing with it.  Because I have a backpack full of tools! 
This time around I'll be looking for opportunities to grow instead of struggles.

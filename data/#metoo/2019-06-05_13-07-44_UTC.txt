Happy Pride Month! 🏳️‍🌈
.
.
This month, we celebrate and open the dialogue surrounding #LGBTQIA+.✊🏼#LGBTQIA+ youth deserve to grow up #safe, #respected, and #valued. One way we can ensure that is with comprehensive, inclusive sex education in schools. Another is to create a culture where everyone, and most especially young people, are empowered and respected. To learn more, check out and sign the #GirlsToo Pledge. ❤️ 🧡 💛 💚 💙 💜 🖤

Also, join us on Saturday June 15th as we march in the #yorkprideparade 🙌🏼💞 All are welcome! Email emmanuelle@girlsincyork.org to register 🤗

Let’s talk about how important it is to read this book if your body is in need of healing. It was recommended by a guest on the podcast “Why Are People Into That?!” during an episode on consent in lieu of listening to the episode for anyone in the audience with trigger concerns about the topic. As the author even admits, my inability to put the book down may have a lot to do with me simply being ready for this positive change, and that will might be the cause of miraculous transformation. But I wish this book had come into my life sooner. I feel the care in her words as she explains the mind-muscle connection. I share with you all as an act of paying forward. “When we understand the emotional muscle body as a whole, we’re empowered to change the patterns of our lives for the better.” #health #ptsd #trauma #rapeculture #metoo #metoomovement

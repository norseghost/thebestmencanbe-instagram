Learn to carry your same energy everywhere you go. Donâ€™t let negative souls bring unbalanced energy out of you. At the end of the day you never know who really needed you to be you. 
Spread love and letâ€™s take it worldwide. 
My thoughts go out to those suffering in the world today. I LOVE YOU. ðŸ“¸ @elysealbeyta

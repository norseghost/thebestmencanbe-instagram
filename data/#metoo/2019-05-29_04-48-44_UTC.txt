This part of my journey is priceless. It had been about a decade since I really took 4 days away from son and was more than 30 minutes to an hour away from me. 
It was my retreat and I was able to spend time with a large group of deeply melanated women which I've never done. We went to the mountains and for the first time in 10 years I was not the driver. 
Nor did I have to organize anything. All I was required to do was show up and enjoy me. This was my retreat. 
A retreat to explore me, be with a new crowd, slep in the car, share or explore, party, laugh, and be a woman!

My retreat to be with me came from being part of the @coppervibrations CVT which was filled with lots of experiences. 
I give thanks to the Creator for this moment of self retreat to be a better woman, mother, and professional. 
The ancestors walk with me and I'm grateful for their guidance and protection. 
As a child I was raped/molested so it was hard to leave my son.  Yet, I knew I had to for me, for us, and for the world who seeks me constantly in business as a consultant, guide, empath, speaker, artist, model, actress, writer, motivator, healer and educator.

These pictures represent the next level within upper levels. 
Giving thanks!

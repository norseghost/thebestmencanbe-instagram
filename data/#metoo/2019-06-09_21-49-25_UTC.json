She\u2019s quite possibly something of a child prodigy; writing her first song, a single chord symphony called \u2018I can play E minor\u2019 two days after 'borrowing' her dad\u2019s guitar and just one day after learning her first chord - which my friend Sherlock strongly suspects just happened to be E minor. Seriously though, I\u2019ve had another of her songs \u2018Burning House\u2019 at the top of my \u2018must write about this\u2019 list for absolutely ages now. But, because that particular song was based upon a real-life horrific experience of hers, I had never quite found the sensitive approach that I felt it demanded. \nMoving on then - anyone navigating more than a couple of my blog posts will have noticed a penchant for referencing that fine Frank L Baum opus \u2018The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u2019. In fact, now I\u2019ve mentioned it again this has become the fourth occasion of said penching, and frankly, that\u2019s probably a little too much, even for a straw-headed scarecrow such as myself. So here I am, making a super-human effort to finally dispense with that particular literary crutch. \nSadly, I don\u2019t seem completely capable of managing too well without my paperback survival pack, but fortunately with her latest release, Luna Keller has presented an opportunity for me to wax on, instead, about the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and his quasi-romantic novel \u2018Alice\u2019s Adventures In Wonderland\u2019. On the face of it it\u2019s a classic children\u2019s book, yet also quite possibly it could also be interpreted as the repressed inclinations of some Victorian-era Michael Jackson dude.\n\nEnough of that sort of talk though. Let\u2019s examine instead, the premise that \u2018Alice is in Love with The Mad Hatter\u2019. This proposed relationship is actually quite curious. For starters, the Hatter is written up as seemingly middle-aged, whereas Alice appears to us as a naive young girl; a worrying and fairly obvious age-gap there then #metoo\u2026 He\u2019s a sort of Victor Meldrew stereotype, detached from reality, and fond of annoying all and sundry. She\u2019s a fragile thing that most likely wouldn\u2019t harm a hair on the head of a butterfly. And of course, Hatter s"

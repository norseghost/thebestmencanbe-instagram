As a yoga practitioner I've been in a lot of classes where a teacher has touched me without asking first - that's fine as it's not a trigger for me. But as a yoga teacher it's SO important to remember it's not ok for everyone.

I currently teach yoga to survivors of sexual abuse. It's easy to feel comfortable with my students and assume that touch has also become ok. A conversation with one of the ladies I teach reminded me to never assume. She was saying that after years of negative touch, touch from anyone, even her partner is so difficult. Love to her is a conversation, not physical touch.

If someone's enjoyment of touch has been taken away from them then it's our job as yoga teachers to be aware and respectful of that. Touch is an amazing and powerful tool but it's not for everyone.

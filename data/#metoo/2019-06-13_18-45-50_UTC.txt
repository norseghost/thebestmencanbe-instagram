SHARE YOUR STORY! ðŸ’œ
After being in an abusive relationship, there are numerous steps to becoming YOU again. And the biggest struggle I had was feeling like NO ONE understood. .
After a little research, support groups, this IG page and becoming a #domesticviolenceadvocateðŸ’œ. I started to realize that I absolutely WASN'T alone. .
I'm writing a book, about my story. But my main goal is to show that whom ever is reading the book, that they're NOT alone. By doing so, I'd love to see who'd be interested in sharing their stories with me. I want to help those who has or is struggling, and I want YOU to help too! .
Send me a DM if you'd be interested!

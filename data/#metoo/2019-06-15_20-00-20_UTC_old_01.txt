So they know we aren't stopping the push for reparations. What do they do? Let's water down the American Holocaust called Slavery. This opinion piece is meant to disrespect Black Americans. We should be outraged at the New York Times. The New York Times wouldn’t dare compare gay with the Jewish Holocaust because it would be hell to pay. Continue to push for reparations even more than ever. Gay people aren’t even asking for reparations so this is nothing but a propaganda piece by WS MSM. #africandiaspora #tellingitlikeitis #newblackmedia #reparations #africandiasporanews

Back in January we stopped and helped a girl when we were at hungry jacks who was being abused by her 'boyfriend'. She left him after this incident and was hospitalised shortly after  when she went back to get her stuff and he attacked her. Her attacker is in jail waiting to go to court on a slew of charges from these 2 incidents and others. Mstr26 and I filed witness statements with the police today to help make sure this piece of shit can't do this to someone else in the foreseeable future. I am so proud of T for standing up and not letting this PoS make her feel ashamed of what happened. We told her on the day that if she needed any help in the future we are there for her, and this may well just be the beginning. but we will not back down now.

The one thing that really sticks with me from that day is her saying to me "Thankyou, no one has ever stopped before". This in itself broke my heart as I know that feeling very well. No one ever stopped, or called the police over the many years I put up with shit in my marriage. Please stop. Please offer help. You may be the first person who ever has. You may be the person who quite literally saves someone's life by doing so. By giving them the strength to make a change and step away from something that they thought they never could. Put out a hand of support. Please.

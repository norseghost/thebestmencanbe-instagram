Men will no longer be called men if they survive a sexual assault 
Mostly because how men are socialised and expected to behave in our society

Why our society prevents men from talking about sexual assault?

An abuse is an abuse...it is not only for women

Talking of feminism....sometimes I think men need male-ism too...üôÅ

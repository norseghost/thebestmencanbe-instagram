Today I finished treatment for PTSD. Today’s also the day I decide to speak up about Sexual Violence. From the ages of 14-16 I was sexually assaulted. violated. traumatized. I have fought a quiet battle for the past few years, but today I will no longer be silent. Today and every day forward, I demand that my voice be heard. I did not ask to be assaulted therefore I refuse to hang my head in shame any longer. I will place the blame where it deserves to be placed - on the people who abused me. No one asks to be assaulted, yet 1 in 3 people are. 1 in 3.
I will hold my head high, time is up and I am taking back my power. I am fierce and strong. I have come so far, and my journey of healing is no where close to over. 
Today, tomorrow, and everyday after I will advocate for survivors of Sexual Assault. 
Join me, in starting the conversation about Sexual Assault. Better yet, join me in ending Sexual Violence. ••For every like this post gets I will be donating 0.25$ to the Sexual Assault Centre of Edmonton••

~Allow yourself to hope and believe again. Don’t allow the memories from the past to spoil the present, or to rob you of a future.~ Sometimes, I find it so utterly difficult for me to let go of the past. Of the mistakes I made, the people I hurt, the love I lost and the opportunities I missed. I remember the people who left, or those who didn’t choose to stay. My mind tells me “you weren’t enough,” “you deserve this pain” or “it will happen again.” And in some ways, this is true. I will make mistakes, I will struggle, and people will leave.

But at the same time, I see myself in this moment, and I realize how full and wonderful my life is. I see how I am constantly growing and changing! I see how my past has helped me to form strong roots and to blossom into the resilient, kind, funny, adventurous, passionate woman I am in the present. 🌿🌻🌼

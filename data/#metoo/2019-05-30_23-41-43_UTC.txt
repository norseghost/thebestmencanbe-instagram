Warm-down under lion and goat. Today’s 4 hours in studio involved: about half an hour of release hello floor how where do I soften breathe fall into you open hips empty shoulders swing and roll (that kind of thing), followed by primary series to nāvāsana (no vinyasa), followed by kaỊari leg exercises, postures, “pleats” and salutation, followed by a couple of hours working on this phrase, the initial instruction for which was to move in a way that felt nice and was easeful. But I am bad at following instructions, especially my own, and so we so far have deep pleating hips and a lot of falling into and out of the floor. And I’m not quite through the stage of telling myself I will never ever make a solo again, because they are just too too hard. Instead, as I spend so much time falling to the floor, I enjoy the Miners’ beautiful ceiling. Which is just as well, because tonight’s aikido practice a bit later was very full of ukemi, great for sweat and riding the breath to fall into and out of the floor (clearly a theme), and using the bellows of the breath to soften into and out of gravity as I throw, am thrown, rise and fall. I sometimes have to remind myself that for someone with exhaustion issues, I get quite a lot done.

Though I’m not sure what either the exhaustion or the dissolving spine will make of tomorrow’s 4 hours... #fightinglikeagirlandwhatittaughtme #theatrausirgar #ammanfordminerstheatre #dance #choreography #researchanddevelopment #martialarts #yoga #womenmartialartists #metoo #welshdance #artscouncilwales #cyngorcelfyddydaucymru #aikido #ukemi #aikidowomen

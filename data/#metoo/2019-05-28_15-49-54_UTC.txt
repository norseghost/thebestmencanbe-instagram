On Sunday night, we gave our final performance of #thisiswhathappenstoprettygirls .
We were completely sold out the entire run, which is quite an awesome feat in itself
.
There may have only been 8 of us onstage, but as you can see it took a bloody village to make it happen. And so many creatives were not even present in this photo, including my husband playwright @ken_kwek (but I am holding a photo of him in my hand)
.
I forged new friendships on this production and reinforced old ones, the dearest being Serene Chenâ€™s @snowflickers and my buddy of 24 years, Adrian Pang. It was a privilege for me to act opposite him again. His brilliance at his craft staggers me to this day and he makes my job as an actor so easy. All I have to do is react to his amazeballs ability. He is a world class talent and I love him till the ends of the earth hnghhhhhhh (private joke)
.
.
And this gave me a chance to connect with my Ang Moh twin @traciepang in a whole new way. She is a CHAMPION LEADER. I would work with her again and again in a heartbeat.
.
Most of all to the 100+ sexual assault survivors, first responders, counsellors Ken interviewed - thank you for sharing your stories and for surviving every day. Your courage is admired and undefeated

Hereâ€™s to the beginning of more difficult conversations that must be had, so that our children have a better shot at a kinder world. .

Read our interview with Gerety Executive Jury Lauren Haberfield, Art Director BETC Paris. ***********************************************\n\"I like ideas. Hopefully one of them will make the world better\". Have you already found this idea? Or are you still looking for it? Where do you think it is more likely that it will arrive from?\n\nFor me this is more of a personal affirmation that keeps me coming up with ideas that have purpose.\nOur industry has the ability to change people's perceptions and I believe we should use that power a little more gracefully. \nWhat I want is to make someone\u2019s day just that little bit brighter, whether that's through a social cause, a considered CX or just bringing a smile to someone's face. That's what keeps me going and why I keep pushing myself to be better, to be more creative and to be more inspired.\n\nIn your article in AdNEws you said :\" Look at what\u2019s happening all over the world. There\u2019s been a colossal shift where for the first time, women are actually being listened to\". Why do you think this happened and why now? \nThere has always been brave women who spoke up, however their voices were often dismissed or simply went unheard. What happened with the #metoo movement was an extraordinary phenomenon where once again brave women spoke up, but this time with the help of social media, their message was connected to millions of women all over the world. I think we reached the perfect point of globalization combined with women being completely fed up with the way they were treated. \nIt was a spark that caught aflame and turned into a fire that has burnt down the fundamentales of a lot of industries. There\u2019s a real energy in the air as women challenge and push back against the inequality they\u2019ve been carrying for so long. Now it\u2019s up to us to determine how we want to rebuild those structures in a hopefully more equal and considered way.\n***********************************************\nRead the full interview @ geretyawards.com #advertising #creativity #awards #gerety #geretyawards #femalepower #interview #France #Australia #ArtDirector #creative #BETC"

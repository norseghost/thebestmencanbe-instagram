YWCA New Britain's Sexual Assault Crisis Service (SACS) covers a 46-town region - all of Hartford County, part of Tolland County and the town of Plymouth. We offer assistance to sexual assault survivors and their loved ones. These services are critical after such trauma, helping victims and their families regain feelings of independence, optimism, and hope. The advocates on staff are trained to work with hospital staff, the court system, public safety officers and other counselors assisting their clients. You can call our 24-hour English and Spanish confidential hotlines for immediate access to trained, certified counselors anytime. #sacs#sexualtassaultcrisisservice#metoo#hotline #crisishotline#webelieveyou

3 years ago I posted this edited version of #BrockTurner's father's statement. The last week or 2, I've been getting lots of new likes on that old post from 2016. I think it's down to a combination of things - the anniversary of Brock's case in the media, and also recently someone in the US getting 40yrs in prison for bribing college officials. People are comparing the sentences, and so Brock's name and case have come up again. That's my guess anyway.
I think it's interesting to see how much and how little have changed since Brock's case and trial. Judge Persky who gave Brock the minimum sentence possible has been removed, thanks to a passionate and principled campaign. Brock's case preceded #MeToo, and in some ways contributed to the explosion of that movement in 2017 (begun much earlier by Tarana Burke). The narrative and public discourse around rape, consent, trials and safety have completely changed. And yet, a lot remains the same. In Ireland just 6 months ago, a trial held up a rape victim's underwear as "evidence". Women, and particularly women of colour and queer women, who dare to speak out or report their rape are vilified by courts and hounded on social media; while the future "potential" of men accused of rape is protected at all costs. And the election of a sexual harasser in the US - who put through a fragile manbaby into the Supreme Court - has arguably set these conversations, these trials and real safety back years. Are women and victims of all genders better off today? I worry not.

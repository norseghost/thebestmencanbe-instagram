Anti-wrinkle injections are the most popular cosmetic treatment. The process of these injections is relatively quick & easy which involve the injection of a small amount of a purified protein into specific muscles of the face. This medication causes these muscles to relax creating softening of the wrinkles above them. 
Below are the main areas that are treated:
Forehead- Horizontal lines above eyebrows

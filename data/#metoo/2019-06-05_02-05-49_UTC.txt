If you’ve been following me for very long, then you know that I’m a BIG believer in the healing power of water.⠀
⠀
Water does everything from help purify our bloodstreams, to detoxing our organs and flushing out fat! Many of us do not get anywhere near the amount of water we need to be drinking a day. ⠀
⠀
A good rule of thumb is to drink half of your body weight in ounces. I personally aim for a gallon every day. ⠀
⠀
To ensure my water is of the highest quality, I personally use a Kangan Machine which has the ability to infuse oxygen into the water as well as the ability to change the pH settings. ⠀
⠀
Another option for a water filtration system would be a high quality Reverse Osmosis filtration system as well. You can google those to see what works best for you and your family.

IMMUNITY AND ADRENALS - OUR SELF-DEFENSE FRENEMIES⁣
⁣
Today I ran across this super interesting @nytimes article (link in bio) about the relationship between our immune systems and our adrenals. When it comes to self-defense, our bodies have evolved a hierarchy of needs: fight/run from the saber tooth tiger (pictured) first, destroy invading pathogens second. This system keeps us alive in the face of acute threats.⁣
⁣
But what about when our stress response is chronically "on?" Fight-or-flight hormones actually deactivate the immune response to help the body prioritize defense against the most dangerous threat first. But if we're always in fight-or-flight mode, our immune system never has a chance to recover.⁣
⁣
This suppressed immune function can lead to frequent colds, longer recovery periods, and even autoimmune conditions. Stress literally makes us sick!⁣
⁣
By practicing regular mindful stress-reduction techniques, we can help our self-defense mechanisms respond appropriately - which ultimately leads to more sustainable health. This article lists several ideas, such as meditation, exercise, and nutritional therapy, to "get the best from your immune system."⁣
⁣
As an #autoimmunewarrior and a trauma survivor, I have to be especially vigilant about managing my stress. PTSD is known to deplete the immune system by keeping the body in a constant state of hyperarousal. I have a whole toolbox of stress reduction techniques I use every day!⁣

What do you do to boost your immune system and calm your adrenals?⁣

This picture touches my heart every time I look at it.

I was honored to officiate the memorial service for my beautiful Aunt Susan Meredith last May, and at the end of the service my cousin ran up and hugged me. It was the perfect ending to an amazing service in Portland, and it gives me a moment to sit and reflect on my love for my aunt and all of my family.

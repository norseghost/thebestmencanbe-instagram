The road to redemption?

This week the @kulturekats had a night out on the town and saw American writer-actor-director-standup comedian @azizansari live at the @sydneyoperahouse. He brought his #RoadtoNowhere tour to Sydney and Melbourne following a run of shows in India.

The night was a hilarious take on life today, hitting on racism, white privilege, internet culture and so much more.

Aziz didn’t dodge the big topics, including his own #MeToo moment from last year. He addressed the allegation by reflecting on what he went through and how it had made other men think about their own interactions with women. 
The show was filled with a number of more serious moments asking the audience to take a moment and think about their own lives and with profound quips like “Things don’t just become racist when white people figure it out.” He left the stage to the strains a cover of ‘From Both Sides Now’ - a fitting end. Glad to have you back #azizansari

Adrian Piper
A conceptual and performance artist, Piper is a trailblazer for addressing hot-button issues associated with gender and race. In her Mythic Being series, Piper transformed herself into a lower-class black male and walked the streets of Cambridge, exposing the absurdity of society's stereotypes.  As a light-skinned black female artist, her confrontational work remains extremely prescient and significant today, pushing us to question societal hierarchy and the perception of identity.  Recently, Piper was awarded the Golden Lion Award for best artist at the 56th Venice Biennale in 2015 for her work, The Probable Trust Registry, consisting of corporate-looking kiosks where visitors could choose to sign contracts agreeing to live by a set of rules that encouraged personal responsibility.

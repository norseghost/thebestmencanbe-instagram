“365 Believeher.  No more shame, blame and fear.” Women’s stories have been joined together on clotheslines in 17 installations since March 2018.

This piece has been in all 17 and will be joined with the others again in the Popp Martin Student Union Art Gallery at UNCC from June 1-26. (Photo from @clt_boom 2019)

The innocence of a child is the rarest and greatest of treasures-guard it carefully because once it is lost,  it is gone forever.
I made some new friends in Ripon today-their friendliness and bright smiles made my day! Thank you to my new followers-In less than 20 more followers my mom will donate another $25 to the Humane Society of Stanislaus. #children#sexualabuse#nursesareawesome#mentalhealthawareness#metoo#poodlelife#dogsofinstagram#friendship#nature

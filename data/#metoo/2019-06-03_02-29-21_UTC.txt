My #metoo story (link in bio) is dedicated to all the ones out there, laying their hearts on the line for something bigger than themselves - I actually wrote that in my prelude a little over a year ago!

I’ve found that when it’s not just about you, you tend to fight more courageously for it 💪❤️💥
.
You keep showing up when it’s really difficult ❤️💥
.
You keep fighting the good fight 🙋‍♀️
.
You keep the faith 🙏💫
.
Because you know, it’s not about you - it’s about something much bigger.
.
People from 73 countries have read my story, would love for you to join too -> in an effort to help me make my dream come true! ⚽️🙌
.
Which is to help the most amount of people I could ever imagine through my business concept called Social Ingenuity 🌍❤️💥
.
So, here’s to all the ones out there, laying their heart on the line for something bigger than themselves ❤️💥✨

These patches not only match with the Star Wars universe, but it\u2019s a form of catharsis for me. Nazism is somehow making a comeback, lgbt rights are under attack, the Handmaid\u2019s Tale is slowly becoming a reality, and so many of us are making excuses for sexual assailants because it\u2019s either politically or personally convenient for us. I included the #MeToo patch because I want to make it clear I and so many others are out there, advocating for SA survivors, whether or not they choose to be open about what happened to them. The past few years has been hell for us. We let a predator into the head of the Justice system and rapists are somehow still big in Hollywood. Even outside of those circles we let these monsters go because \u201c they\u2019re good swimmers\u201d or \u201c they\u2019re talented in < x,y,z>\u201d . This headassery is personally insulting to me because of what happened when I was 14. This singular event still affects my behavior to this day, as I\u2019ve never been able to find closure. A 60+ year old man sat next to me on the metro, pinned me against the wall with his elbow, and jerked off against me. I was stuck like this for 10 fucking minutes. The salt in the wound with all this was he got away with it because he intentionally made it difficult to ID him. Half of his face was covered by his jacket hood and with any heavily used form of public transportation, it\u2019s virtually impossible to pick out individuals once they blend into the crowd at the stations. Even after I reported it right away ( which I understand not everyone can / wants to do ) it went cold almost immediately. Even In these circumstances, reporting right away doesn\u2019t always guarantee the assailant will be caught. And again, for the 134638478292th time, blame the assailants, not the victims. .\n.\n.\n.\n{#lgbtq #feminism #timesup #feminist #starwars #starwarscosplay #reycosplay #reycosplayer #amazingreys #tfacosplay #theforceawakens #thelastjedi #daisyridley #lgbtcosplay #plussizecosplay #plussizecosplayer #disney #disneycosplay #tljcosplay }"

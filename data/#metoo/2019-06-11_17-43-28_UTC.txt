Narcs will never change or bettering themselves for you. The only time they "act nicely" is in the beginning phase of a relationship, or in the end of a relationship, them fearing to lose their drug of use, aka you. Thats called hoovering, a "game on" tactics, only to get Narcsupply. They will groom you, charm you, and hock you in, by wearing a false mask, but its all just a play. Little by little, the mask will fall off, and they will start showing you their true colors. You will be the supply and target of their sick mindgames, manipulation, gaslighting and intentional cruelty beyond imagination. This will completly take you offguard and create huge confusion, fear, and conflict inside of you. Its a really ugly, heartbreaking, devastating, and deeply disturbing experiance I wish upon no one. Narcs are wolves in sheepcloathing, causing others extreme suffering, pain, confusion and harm. Betrayl at its worst. They will never be satisfied with you, no matter what you do, or dont do, because its not in their nature or interests. They will provoke and punish you, over and over and over again, just for their own sick amusement, because they enjoy seing you hurt and upset. They will find new ways of making you feel "not good enough" taking you down, one day at a time. I compare being with a Narc or being a target of NA, with pouring water in a bucket with no bottom! They will suck you dry literally, emotionally, finacially, physically and spiritually, and leave you totally depleted, burnt out and depressed. If you stay, you will become a shadow of yourself, and you will risk your health, sanity and life. Narcs will kill your soul, mark my words, and the best thing you can do, is to work on an exitplan. Save yourself while you still breathe, and exit out.

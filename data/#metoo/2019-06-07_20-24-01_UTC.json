And perhaps why tackling social inequality and encouraging social mobility continues to be a lower-level priority on the workplace agenda?\u2800\n\u2800\nHowever, as Human Resources Expert Regina Hartley brilliantly conveys in her Ted Talk Why the best hire may not have the perfect resume, those who have fought to achieve the same level of experience, knowledge and qualification as their more privileged peers deserve as many opportunities in the workplace. This potential talent pool certainly should not be overlooked. Indeed, in describing some of the world\u2019s most successful business leaders, Hartley explains:\u2800\n\u2800\n\u201cThey don\u2019t think they are who they are in spite of adversity, they know they are who they are because of adversity. They embrace their trauma and hardships as key elements of who they\u2019ve become, and know that without those experiences, they might not have developed the muscle and grit required to become successful\u201d.\u2800\n\u2800\nAs HR professionals and employers, we can do our bit for social inclusion \u2013 starting with your D&I strategy.\u2800\n\u2800\nFrom the recruitment process \u2013 the writing of job descriptions and person specifications, the application selection process and interviews \u2013 to opportunities for training, promotion and rewards for achievement, as well as cultivating your workplace culture \u2013 attitudes towards employee worth and values of contribution \u2013 class needs to be considered."

Leticia Vallejo, a housekeeper at a Marriott hotel in Irvine, California, said that back in the summer of 2017, a drunk male guest groped her while she was cleaning the hotel lobby bathroom. As he did so, he offered her $50. 
In an interview, Vallejo, 51, said that when she told one of her supervisors, the response was laughter—and a joke to the effect of “he should have offered you $100.” This wasn’t the first, or the last, incident in a hotel bathroom, said Vallejo, who has worked at the Marriott location for 18 years. Men often urinate in front of her and make inappropriate comments or advances. It’s a regular occurrence for female housekeepers, she said. #hotel #housekeeping  #metoo #housekeeping #protectyourstaff

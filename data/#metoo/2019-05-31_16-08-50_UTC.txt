Please join me and supporting my friend  Kimberly Ellis and our next California Democratic Party chair.

As Chair, she plans to be a bridge for all sides, because while we may not always live on the same side of every election or issue, Kimberly will always strive for a leadership approach that, in the end, can bring us all back together.

As we prepare to officially kick off the Convention in San Francisco, it’s got me thinking a lot about the bridges, the Bay Area and the California Democratic Party.

For those who aren’t familiar with the make-up of the nine counties of the Bay Area, let me assure you, they are as diverse as the California Democratic Party.

We have our rural and agriculture life, diverse and distinct communities of color, urban core and densely populated communities and wealth and education divides that span from the highest to lowest ends of the spectrum... and yet we’re all connected (metaphorically and physically) by bridges.

In this moment, our California Democratic Party needs a healthy dose of the bridge metaphor in our thinking about Party solidarity.

You see, bridges serve a special role in our lives - they connect to places naturally divided.

The California Democratic Party will never be contiguous in thought, make-up or approach. We’re always going to be a Party with natural breaks and divides. But the measure of who we are, of how I hope to lead this Party we all love, will be by our ability to build bridges.

So please join me and electing Kimberly.

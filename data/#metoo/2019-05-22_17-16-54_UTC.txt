So I did some more reading and..... "Of the 124 526 total rape cases reported in the last 3 financial years, children were the victims of a sickening 41% of these cases." I am normally not the type of person to post about movements but after doing some reading and research I discovered that the problem is much worse than what we all think.

It has been stated that the worst type of crime is murder, sexual assault (of any kind) sits as the 14th worst type of crime. Sexual assault is a form of murder as when someone is sexually assaulted a part of them dies, and that is murder. 
Even though the generally public and our judiciary won't see it that way due to the fact that the person is still living and breathing.

Statistically 45% of sexual assault victims have suicidal thoughts with a whopping 28% of victims acting on their thoughts.

Sexual assault should be classified as murder.

Next time you are about to sexually assault someone think to yourself "How would I feel if this happened to me?" That is under the assumption you are capable of feeling.

Sexual assault is WRONG!!! #inspiration #wakeup #speakup #hashtag #instalike #instalove #instafollow #instalove #timesup #repost #quote #amazing #metoo #movement #sexualassaultvictims

August was a part of this powerful dance ‘Part 2’, choreographed as a commentary on domestic abuse towards spouses and women at StarPower Dance Competition.

The narrative is painful, heartbreaking and chills you to the bone knowing that everyday partners, wives, sisters, daughters & our kinfolk have to deal with inequality in their relationships. 
The very place that should be their sanctuary and safe haven.

Let’s shine that light brighter in support, calling out anyone who perpetuates the abuse! 
Thank you #nycdanceofficial for providing a platform to spread awareness, & #starpowerdancecompetition for recognising this choreography.

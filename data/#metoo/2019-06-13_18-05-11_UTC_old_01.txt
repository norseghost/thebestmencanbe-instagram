Yesterday in Seattle a woman was targeted, robbed, and injured. 
We cannot stress enough the importance of being situationally aware, and to learn how to defend yourself; regardless of gender or age. 
Law enforcement will not respond to protect you. 
Your personal security is your responsibility alone. .

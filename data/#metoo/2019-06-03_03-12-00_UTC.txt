L G B T Q I A + // Support And Awareness 
_____________________________________________
We acknowledge that LGBTQIA+ survivors of domestic abuse may feel a lack of support when it comes to abusive situations. At the Family Crisis Center, we are here to help; we are here to serve ALL survivors. 
We know supporting someone who is going through an abusive relationship can be hard. This is especially hard if the person you’re trying to help is LGBTQIA+. Remember, the principles for supporting in unhealthy relationships are the same regardless of that person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. 
Feel free to reach out to us for tips or any  questions.

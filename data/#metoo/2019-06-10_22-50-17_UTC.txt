I wish videos like these didn’t exist but they do - more of them should be posted online but when a phone is taken out usually an officer bullies and scares the videographer to put it away. If you are not someone who gets racially profiled, if you have never been pulled over, handcuffed, or targeted and treated drastically different than someone who has lighter color skin than you, you can’t imagine the reality of the fact that at any given time, for any reason, you could be pulled over, literally just because. There is no reason no rational nothing you could imagine as scary as having no real safety and no real rights in a country that emphasizes its history of freedom and emancipation. .

If you’re still reading join the revolution. I’m creating a piece of technology that will end this bullshit and police the police. God bless those who stand with us - we will be watching and reprimanding and exposing properly when those with power abuse it and violate someone’s basic human rights. We will expose those who use their power to strip a man or woman of their human rights and scare the shit out of them or even detain them for longer than 15 min possibly making them late for work where they could lose their job because it is not permitted to be detained for longer than 15 min for no reason. This ends NOW. Please DM me if you have a heart and a pulse - because if you don’t respond to this you must not. I need everyone’s help. #policebrutality #police #endracialprofiling #justiceforjunior #justice #blacklivesmatter #metoo #metoomovement #alllivesmatter #maga #forgiveness #inspiration #realtalktime #melanin #melaninpoppin #melaninqueen #melaninmagic #melaninking #espn #nba #nfl #kaepernick

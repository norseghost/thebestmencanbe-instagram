Hi, this is me saying happy pride month everyone!!! 🌈🏳️‍🌈🌈🏳️‍🌈🌈🏳️‍🌈🌈🏳️‍🌈 no matter what you identify as, i support you and love you💕💕💕 the world has a shit ton to progress but what i can say is in the last couple years more and more people I've met are more accepting of shit. So there IS hope out there, irrelevant of our shitty government and the homophobia transphobia and lots more! For those of you who don't know, im not into labels but im pretty much into everyone and gender fluid. I don't talk about my sexuality a lot but I feel like that it's important to be who I am. Anyways from now on, I'm gonna be more unapologetically me. That means I'll be talking and posting more stuff that pisses me off and be more political. I've always been really opinionated but freshman year after dealing with major depression and paranoia, I tried to steer clear. That was a good idea back then, but now it's time to stand up for everything I believe in and all the bs going on in the world. people tell me all the time that I shouldn't be political in school or with friends or whatever, but I need to know I have the same morals as them so I know if I should be their friend. So this is me saying no more being complacent and happy pride month to everyone. Love you lots❤🧡💛💚💙💜 #yemenfamine #pride #pridemonth #sudanrevolts #whitesaviourism #xenephobes #genderwageequalitygap #diasporaissues #globalwarming #metoo #feminist #terrorismisntreligion #unlackofintervention #muslimban #mentalhealthstigmas #prochoice #mybodymychoice #socialjustice #manymoreissues #butyougetthepoint #iloveyouguyssomuch

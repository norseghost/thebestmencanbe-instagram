STAND UP AND ACT TO STOP VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN! 
Violence against women is recognized to be a serious and widespread problem in Australia. 
As a community, we NEED to take ACTION! 
So...to all the women out there, we want to help provide you with the support, education and skills to protect yourselves and be protected against violence.

VSMA will be hosting FREE self defense events, with a black belt specialist, to women of all ages!

Please express your interest below (or PM) with the area you would like the events to be hosted (North/South/East/West) so we can arrange for our sessions to be available in your area.

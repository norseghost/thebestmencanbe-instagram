Our cultures are heavily influenced by our religions. We really do believe that religion organization can play a big role in creating awareness about sexual assault issues, they can teach and provide support for victims. As most of you prepare to go to church, we ask you to pls talk to your church leaders and ask them to consider talking about sexual assault. Ask them to create awareness and provide services for victims. Report back to us with your findings. #MeTooEthiopia #metoo #metoomovement #metooafrica #metooethiopia #survivor #ethiopian #ethiopia #women #men #change #breakthesilence #yourenotalone

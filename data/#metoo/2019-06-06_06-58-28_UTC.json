How many times have you broken your own heart?\nA. 10,001 at the very least.\n\nMy expectation of what an assault victim, an assault survivor does, is, or would be, have been incredibly altered.\n\nWhen I was a social worker it was all about the fight.\nStand up.\nPush for justice.\nBe seen.\nBe heard.\nBe loud.\nBe aggressive (Be, be aggressive). When the #metoo movement happened, every story, every Facebook post, every article in newspaper was like a fresh kick in the teeth. I was still pretty raw in 2017, everything was fresh.\n\nI resented that movement. RESENTED IT. I hated all the people on my friends list who posted about rape victims. What the fuck did they know? I hated them because everything they posted about, spoke to the woman I was no longer able to be.\nI didn\u2019t want to fight.\nI wanted to lie down.\nI didn\u2019t want to be seen.\nI didn\u2019t want to be heard.\nI didn\u2019t want to be aggressive.\n\nEvery action had a consequence and each consequence took another chunk out of my resilience, my resolve, my tenderness, my heart. Pieces of me were falling away until I had no idea who I was.\n\nI hated the #metoo movement because I hadn\u2019t lived up to my own pre-assault expectations. I wasn\u2019t the woman I thought I would be. I couldn\u2019t rage. I broke my own heart over and over in defeat of myself. \u201cYou\u2019re a fraud.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re weak.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a failure.\u201d How can you speak about women standing up for themselves when you won\u2019t even stand up for what happened to you?\n\nBut the big bad, the powers at play, the comprehensive complexities of cultural conditioning created a clusterfuck; a self consciously crumbling consciousness.\n\nIt\u2019s been 851 days since my assault and I\u2019m only just starting to feel strong. A few wobbles, like a baby deer, finally finding its legs, but it\u2019s getting there.\n\nExpectations have gone out the window, all we have is now. How you are now. How you feel today. What you can do today. And who you choose to be.\n\ud83d\udcf8 ?\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#sexualassaultsurvivor #sexualassaultrecovery #nothingisimpossible #vulnerabilityrules #personaldevelopment #vulnerabilityisstrength #livingontheedge #selfdefenseforwomen #expectationsvsreality #metoomovement #youcanheal"

Indian Voters - 2019
A Woman’s World 
Week 28

For the first time in Indian elections, more women than men are likely to have voted. 
According to a recent survey, 70% put the safety of women as their number one concern. Sadly, violence against women is on the rise everywhere in India. 
It is believed the increased female voters are women using their power to help improve personal safety. 
I am now on week 28 of a year long project called a Woman’s World. Each week I explore a news story of something of relevance connected with feminism. If you wish to follow the link is on my bio. You will also find the news article for this week.

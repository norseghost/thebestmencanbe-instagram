U knew that I knew everything but were hoping I’d keep quiet...outta grace...admit I did it cuz the truth would cause a riot. My silence, yeah it was the plug...and without fail I would supply it...even if the facts would set us free I know ur pride would deny it. ♠️ -Magnolia RoSay #callaspadeaspade #overcomer .

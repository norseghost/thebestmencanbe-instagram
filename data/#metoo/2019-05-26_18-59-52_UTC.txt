Sometimes we just need to breathe and trust. Why is that so hard and so scary? I guess we’ve all been hurt and dissapointed. .
.
But, what makes this time different is the bigger picture, the state of the world. I don’t want to get into the details, because that’s not the point of this post. However, it’s important to acknowledge that many of us feel less stable and secure than we used to and some of that can be attributed to collective stress. .
.
As a result, our goals should be to up our game in order to counteract that stress. To trust, love, connect, hope, and dream with a bravery, courage, and strength that pushes through our fears and doubts. .
.
We only have this life to live. Every day is precious. Our time is our greatest resource. .
.
I will continue to rise no matter how many times I fall. Who’s with me? .

The WARIF Gatekeepers Project: The FIRST ever training of Traditional Birth Attendants on being first respondents in cases of gender based violence. 
These community gate keepers were taught how to identify, report and refer cases of rape and sexual abuse. In most rural areas, traditional birth attendants are the first point of contact for issues relating to sexual and gender based violence. 
During the training, they admitted that numerous incidents of rape had been brought to their attention and they were happy there was finally a place these survivors could seek  medical care and counselling totally free of charge.

WARIF in partnership with @actfoundation_  has trained over 1,000 Traditional Birth Attendants in 20 Local Government Areas all over Lagos to date.

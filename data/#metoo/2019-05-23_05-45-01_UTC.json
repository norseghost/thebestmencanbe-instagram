But this is going to hurt for a while.\n\u2022\nIn five hours, you\u2019re going to show up to graduation and face him again. You\u2019ll put on the white flag bearer\u2019s robe. You\u2019re going to take photos and crack jokes like usual. Once the cameras focus on the actual graduates, you\u2019ll break character. It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re stronger than you think.\n\u2022\nIn a month, you\u2019ll start the internship that changes your life in Dallas. It will weigh heavily on you, but you\u2019ll still work extra days to distract you and get experience for the career you love. It will be on your mind every single mile you run for summer training \u2014 telling you to go faster. It\u2019s okay. You have more endurance than you think.\n\u2022\nIn a year, you\u2019ll graduate college. Your Big will be conspicuously absent after what happened. It will be a joyous day, but you will wish life played out differently. It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re happier than you think.\n\u2022\nIn two years, you\u2019ll be faced with your toughest battle. You\u2019ll talk of this night in hushed tones in a Denny\u2019s. You sit through hours long conference calls pouring over every detail. You\u2019ll fight off panic attacks at work as a result. You\u2019ll finally call it what it was \u2014 rape. It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re tougher than you think.\n\u2022\nIn three years, you\u2019ll know you\u2019re truly in love. Your new job will be daunting, but you\u2019ll find a way to juggle it all \u2014 even if no one knows the battle you\u2019re fighting off camera. It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re more resilient than you think.\n\u2022\nIn four years, you\u2019ll be mad it still bugs you. You\u2019ll grow frustrated as you college welcomes him back as a hero in math and political science. But you\u2019ll sit on your patio and type this out to yourself as a storm rolls in. It\u2019s okay. You more at peace than you think.\n\u2022\nThe next four years will be hard. People won\u2019t understand. They will tell you your pain is invalid because of your upbringing and many other things you can\u2019t control. But the right people will listen. They will hear your story. And they will care. It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re surrounded by more honorable people than you think.\n\u2022\n-Deron R. Molen, 5/23/19 #Survivor #MeToo"

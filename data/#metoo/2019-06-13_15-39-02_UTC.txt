AT #KOLAJFEST #NEWORLEANS

Women in Collage

From the #MeToo movement to unprecedented political gains in the recent election in the United States, the voices of woman are getting louder and being heard more. Women are engaged in all sorts of collage making and as we see time and time again, when the axis of art history is shifted from painting to collage, suddenly the work of countless women artists becomes pivotal to understanding the evolution of art history. Dafna Steinberg will host a panel at Kolaj Fest New Orleans that presents the work of Steinberg; Elke Desutter; Beth Guipe Hall; G. E. Vogt and opens a dialogue about the role of women as makers of collage and as the subjects of collage works. MORE

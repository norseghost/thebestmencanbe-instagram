Today I honor the woman I am and all the women I have been. I honor all that I have experienced and all that has been inflicted on me. For all those things combined have come together to create the most important person in my life .... ME.... and today I am madly, deeply and passionately in love with myself. I am pure beauty. I am pure love. I am all the good that I see in this world despite my past. I am a fiercely healed WOMAN ðŸ§¡

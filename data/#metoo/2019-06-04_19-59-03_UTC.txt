Just a little over a year ago, the Republic of Ireland voted to end its ban on abortion, a win for reproductive rights in a country largely bound to its religion and tied to its Eighth Amendment. The death of Savita Halappanavar, a young woman living in Ireland who died from complications of a miscarriage after being denied an abortion, the country of Ireland lept into action in an effort to repeal an amendment which protestors found to be outdated and threatening to some pregnant women’s health. They gathered outside the Irish Parliament, chanting Savita’s name. Since the end to the abortion ban in Ireland, there has been a push for the same result in the Northern Ireland region of the United Kingdom. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Our energy flows where our focus goes ✨✨
For real we all have negative stuff, but I know I attract what I focus on, so I don’t want anymore junk coming from me, or you! 🤷‍♀️ I survived myself as someone whose identify centred around victimhood, entitlement, grief & fear for decades. I initially survived by numbing myself with alcohol, food, relationships, shopping, exercise, tv- you name it!! And I was lucky to make it out alive. I then made changes in my mind, body and spirit because I wanted to live and be present for my children and in time, for myself. So I understand the pain but I also understand choice 🌅 I choose me. I choose life. I choose love. I choose to be with others whose actions show want those things too 💕 and I choose not to apologise or justify my right to choose.

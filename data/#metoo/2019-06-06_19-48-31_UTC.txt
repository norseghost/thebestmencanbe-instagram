⚡️Editing our first podcast series ‘Born Equal’ yesterday with @kheamahp and @emma_gardner_elvis ⚡️
.
.
The first episode is with ex metropolitan detective superintendent Jane Scotchbrook, out later this month. Jane was definitely in a position where decisions were being made. .
.
We talk about overtly sexist references Jane faced early in her career and more recently the prevalence of sexting amongst school children and what parents should be aware of. .

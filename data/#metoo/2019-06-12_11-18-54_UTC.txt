This work doesn't sit well with me. Yes, great art Basel is a massive platform and talking about the me too movement fab! But is it? There has been A LOT of money pumped into this, I assume people can buy it too? Let's hope if this is the case money is going to related charities and there has been a contribution (I honestly doubt it, let's hope I'm wrong!). There is Images in the piece of a woman (not sure if there is others) who didn't give them permission to use her image and have just exploted a survivors story. It's gross!! I hope the gallery, curator and artist, andrea bowers do address the use of the images cause people do make mistakes. Love to know what others think about this piece?

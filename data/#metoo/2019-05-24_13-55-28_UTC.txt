Day 2.
.
I don't know what's happening right now?
People getting raped like it's nothing! How can someone think of rape is hard to believe.
I accept the fact that we boys do check out girls and we talk it out among friends but never think of even talking to them. 
Here we are scared to even talk and people are forcing themselves and then brutally killing them.
How can all the rapists not think of the victim as a human?
A girl walking down the road and suddenly she's dragged, beaten up, things inserted in her private parts and then left to die or killed so no one can recognize her. 
The most hurting thing is, we cannot do anything about it. It's all in the hands of the person wild enough to do so, and that person can be anywhere. 
This poem is written as a person who lost someone he loved because of this inhumane act.

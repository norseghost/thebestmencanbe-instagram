Katherine Hepburn

Actor

Frequently mentioned as one of the most influential figures and one of the greatest actors in history, she was known for  her fierce independence and spirited personality and the one who truly started the idea of the "modern woman".
She remained as a leading actress for over 60 years in Hollywood and won four Best Actress Oscars - a record maximum number received by any individual in the Awards' history.
.
."She broke the mold for women in Hollywood, where she brought a new breed of strong-willed females to the screen." - Sheridan Morley

Off screen, Hepburn's lifestyle was ahead of her time, coming to symbolize the "modern woman" and playing a part in changing gender attitudes.
.
.
"Confident, intelligent and witty, Katharine Hepburn defied convention throughout her professional and personal life ... Hepburn provided an image of an assertive woman whom females could watch and learn from." - Horton and Simmons

Hepburn's legacy extends to fashion, where she pioneered wearing trousers at a time when it was a radical move for a woman. She helped make trousers acceptable for women, and fans began to imitate her clothing.

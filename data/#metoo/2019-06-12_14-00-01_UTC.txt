⁣⁣⁣
Click the link in my bio to read my new blog post, this blog post has been floating around my head a long time and after the news from the Women & Equalities Committee broke yesterday, I knew I had to post it.⁣⁣⁣

“Companies need to stop using their own in-house HR team to investigate, they need to stop using two bit investigators that meet you in a damp and musty old building in the middle of London and don’t record your notes properly.”⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
This post was both easy and hard to write, and it’s a hard read but it needs to be read. If it makes you feel uncomfortable, good. ⁣

People should feel uncomfortable reading about the illicit acts that are covered up by companies these days especially in regard to sexual misconduct, abuse & harassment.⁣⁣⁣

How can we let go of the fear of the #metoo movement causing for the new relationships?\u201d Her response from the Pledians is \u201cwhat\u2019s happening between masculine and feminine is the core wounding to come into sacred union within yourself.\u201d What this means to me is to stop \ud83d\uded1 calling in love, thinking about love, sending love. \ud83d\ude31\u201cWTF Erikaa why are you teaching about sacred sexuality if you are saying and believing those things?\u201d First, I AM LOVE \u2665\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17 You are love.\ud83c\udf38\nYou are sex. \ud83c\udf38\nYou are that life force. \ud83c\udf38\nwith or without clothes.\ud83c\udf38 My unique approach to what\u2019s working and not working in terms of sex is a blend of getting real, being present, and start choosing differently. \nWe first are not going to talk about \ud83d\ude31Technique.\n\ud83d\ude31Positions.\n\ud83d\ude31BDSM.\n\ud83d\ude31Tantra breathework.\n\nWe first must get intimate...in terms of stripping your conditionings from the old paradigm... Retraining the mind to be in your body. \nLetting go of strategy and hacking your way through system of being be a SEX GOD or close to it. \nBefore we start, you must find yourself getting REAL while \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddda away your old beliefs about sex and love from the old paradigm. \ud83e\udd70Get REAL with your magnificence \ud83e\udd70Get REAL that I\u2019m giving you what you need, not what you want. \ud83e\udd70Get real that you must \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0f yourself of the old paradigm to step into the new paradigm. \ud83e\udd70Get real you didn\u2019t grow up knowing you were loved...You grew up knowing you needed to earn it.\n\nThey walk away being \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc03 of their conditions around sex, money, and creative blocks. \nRead rest in the comments..."

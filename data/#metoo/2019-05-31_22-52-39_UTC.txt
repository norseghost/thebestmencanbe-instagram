"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out - Because I was not a Socialist.
•
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out - Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
•
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out -
Because I was not a Jew.
•
Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me." – Martin Niemoller

It is perhaps not a major publishing plot twist that, almost two years after the #MeToo movement burst into public consciousness the traditionally male-dominated world of the thriller has been ceding ground to a different kind of hero(ine). The titles included in this year's summer reading roundup — linked in the bio — put women in the spotlight. Last year, British thriller writer Sophie Hannah told us that her favorite fictional villains were Mr. Brocklehurst or Aunt Reed in Charlotte Brontë’s “Jane Eyre,” or Hindley Earnshaw in Emily Brontë’s “Wuthering Heights.” “I tend to feel sorry for almost all villains, but not those ones,” she said. “I loathe them all and still want to give them a hard punch on the nose, decades after I first met them.” #tbt | 🎨 @jilliantamaki

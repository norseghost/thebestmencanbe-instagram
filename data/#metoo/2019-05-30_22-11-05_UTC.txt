**DEEP BREATHS & A CONTENT WARNING** my piece “A Girl’s History of Consent” has been published on @prometheusdreamingmag (link in bio ☝🏻) It’s personal, graphic and includes descriptions of sex, pornography, drinking, drugs and assault. *******************************************************I wrote it in the months after the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. I wanted to acknowledge the horror & complexity of that political moment & explore how and why it brought up so much rage for me and many of my friends. *******************************************************This was not an easy piece to write & probably won’t be an easy piece to read for many. But I hope it can play a part in a broadening conversation about assault, sexism, misogyny, privilege & the #metoo & #timesup movements *******************************************************A big thank you to my readers, editors & encouragers on this one @linalryan @alexstonehill @rejjarts @re.possessor @sarahglidden @eroynfranklin @partnowjess @hugohouse @kristenmillares *******************************************************PS. If you don’t want to know details of (some of) my sexual history, feel free to skip this one 😘*******************************************************PPS.

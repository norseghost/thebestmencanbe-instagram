We will Be Heard. It's Not Our Fault. We Are Not Alone. 
Over 3000 quilts make up this EPIC craftivist statement by survivors of sexual violence. 
I wish I could be at the Washington National Mall to be amongst my sisters in the struggle. 
Do you think people will finally hear that violence against women, queers, trans and gender non-binary people, is one of the most serious crises of our time, still, 2019, North America.

Yes us, our time, right now. 
This crafty brilliant work shows the lengths (literally) we have to go to, to be heard by straight white male legislators and decision makers that benefit from the continued silence on these realities. 
I bow before the amount of courage, labour and magnificence behind this prophetic art.

We will be heard. We are not Alone. It is NOT our FAULT.

So much gratitude to these sisters.

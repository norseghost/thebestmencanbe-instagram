Thanks to all our panelists and participants at the “#MeToo + 18 Months” seminar. Over the course of two hours, we discussed the issues particular to theatres and dance troupes as they seek to abide by the law, give voice to victims, and take preventive measures to ensure the safety of all artists. 
Look out for more events like this one, and let us know if you have any suggestions for future panels.

I was chillin on YouTube watching a marvel edit and there was this like,,, group of people in the comments like “oh my stony is otp uwu they’re so cute and gayyy” and I hate those type of people very much. Also I was reading a WebToon and in the comments one girl was like “oh I think that character is gay!” And another was like “he is. I’m a fan girl so my gaydar is amazing” I’m just??? One. They’re characters in a comic. I don’t think gaydar works with that. Two. If you’re a gAy fan girl then sure ur gaydar may be good but like??? I hate that type of person??? People who fetishize the gays™??? Icky.

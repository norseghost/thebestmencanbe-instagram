I am sure many of you know about the Amazon Smile program, where your purchases trigger donations from Amazon to a charity of your choice. However, you may not realize that there are many Planned Parenthood locations also included on this charity list. While I love the World Wildlife Fund and consider it to be a very worth organization, I myself just changed to the Planned Parenthood of St. Louis, MO, one of many states who have recently passed aggressive and violating laws regarding abortion rights. I strongly recommend changing your Amazon Smile to support one of these organizations, because we have to stand together against this hatred of and attempt to control women. Don't forget to go to smile.amazon.com when shopping so that your purchases count! #amazonsmile #protectwomen #stopthebans #plannedparenthood #metoo #mybodymychoice #abortionisahumanright

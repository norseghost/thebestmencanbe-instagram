Today is #DenimDay! I’m proud to be joining activists all over the world in wearing an item of clothing made from denim (in my case, it’s a secondhand shirt). Doing so is a symbolic gesture of solidarity with sexual assault/rape survivors. This came about in 1998 when a court in Italy overturned a rape conviction because the “tight jeans” the woman wore during the attack were “too difficult for the perpetrator to get off without help” - implying consent. The following day, women in the Italian Parliament wore jeans in protest.👖 So, 21 years later, the same gesture continues to bring solidarity among survivors and helps to debunk the harmful rape myths that still exist today. #SAAM

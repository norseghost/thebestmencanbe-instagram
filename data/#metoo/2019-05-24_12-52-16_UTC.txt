Perception is such a deep part of human existence.  The way we look at another comes through our life experiences that we have endured.  They are both positive and negative, and they actually begin at conception. 
Perception;  a way of regarding, understanding, or interpreting something; a mental impression. •BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD
•DON’T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY
•DON’T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS •ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST ~ The Four Agreements

Natural dyed clothing. Itâ€™s the only way. The Age of Aquarius will be the Age of humans and peace, love, and service. Being  Aquarius myself .. I see the world ðŸŒŽ in such funny ways .. ðŸ–¤. We shall all live as one family and wars will cease. Humans and humanity will prevail again. As the Berlin Wall fell, other walls will fall. We will all be united under one God, one spirit, one self. .. the walls we try to build .. will only keep ourselves from living.. boundaries are meant to be crossed and your dreams are free.. Bhajan & me... .

We are warriorsâ€”our war is for peace. We want to break all the barriers, all the fears and we want to break all this bigness and smallness. I remember the word of Nanak, "The higher you are, the more humble you should be, otherwise you have not found the truth," So I welcome you from my heart, and I honestly believe that you will work together and make this world a better place for humanity.

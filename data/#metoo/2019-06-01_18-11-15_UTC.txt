Rp @westmidlandsanimalsave On the way back from our sanctuary day out, we decided to check out a local dairy farm that we know uses the individual calf hutches. The farmer saw us looking at the calves and offered to show them to us. He then proceeded to ask if we wanted to give them their milk. We’re pretty sure he thought we were just random passersby. He told us that the  black calf was one week old, and the brown calf two weeks. He said that their mothers had already been sold to someone else who would “use them for milking”. Such a sad situation, and all for such a trivial reason that people want to consume another species milk. #dairyfree #dairy #govegan #crueltyfree #farmher #sourcream #jello #devilledeggs #chocolateicecream #icecreamcone #milkshake #cheesecakefactory #cheesey #vegetarian #strawberryshortcake #cupcake #eggsandwhich #dairyisscary #stopseparatingfamilies #burgerking #veggies #burrito #quesadilla #vegano #metoo #seperation #donttakeourplanetforgranted

Being indifferent to issues that don’t affect you is a privilege. If you don’t have to think about it, but other people are unsafe & negatively affected by an issue - you have privilege. ⠀
Think about what issues exist in the world that don’t affect you directly but that you can use your power and privilege to change for the better.

Defense attorney Terrance Dillon objects during the fifth day of ex-MSU president Lou Anna Simon's preliminary hearing at the Eaton County Courthouse in Charlotte, Michigan, on Tuesday, June 11, 2019. Simon is accused of lying to police about her knowledge of a 2014 incident involving Larry Nassar's abuse of a patient at the MSU Sports Medicine Clinic. She faces two felony and two misdemeanor counts of lying to a peace officer. Nassar pleaded guilty in 2018 for molesting hundreds of patients over two decades under the guise of medical treatment while he served as a sports-medicine doctor for Michigan State University and the U.S. national gymnastics team. #onassignment for @mlivenews // #mlive #msu #michiganstate #spartans #metoo #metoomovement #sistersurvivors

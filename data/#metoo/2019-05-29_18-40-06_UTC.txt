Let your scars be your motivation and testimony. The Bible speaks of the older women teaching the younger. Let your story be your wisdom you share with those who need to get out or those who don't even know they can come out of that place. It is our job to share with those hurting and in transition to support them and encourage them. Freedom is for everyone, share what you know and experience so other can also be free.

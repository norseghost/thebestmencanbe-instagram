We will be live tomorrow at 8:00 PM for the recording of this episode of "Let's Shed Light On". This podcast is personal and extremely important. If you believe women have the right to choose then please listen in. If we keep silent then we are allowing ourselves to be manipulated and controlled. Special guest will include Allison Coleman and our own Huntsville native Tom Patterson. Allison and I have personal stories to tell but Tom has been kind enough to offer some perspective of how Pro-Choice men see this violation of women.

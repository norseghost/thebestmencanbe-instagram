"The thought of what it would take to stop what she had set in motion was overwhelming; it would require an amount of tact and gentleness that she felt was impossible to summon." And thus Margot, the main character in Kristen Roupenian's story Cat Person consents to sex she doesn't feel like. Sex she will not enjoy but regret and will refer to as probably her worst life choice ever.  When I first read the hyped but brilliant story Cat Person - that found no less than 4.5 million readers online alone - I was intrigued. Margot clearly feels there is a 'point of no return' when it comes to having sex on a date. She feels there is no elegant way out. For an article in the Belgian edition of ELLE, I discussed Margot' s choice and subsequent regrets with therapist #patriciameyntjens, whose advice was both no nonsense and wise: "When a girl tells a man she wants to 'stop what's been set in motion' - as the story puts it - she does not have to be tactful or gentle or elegant. She may feel like she has to, but she doesn't. She only has to be clear and unambiguous and make sure her no is both heard and respected." #stoppleasing #kristenroupenian #catperson #metoo #timesup #noisno #peoplepleaser #bookquote #bookstagram #literaryquotes #interview #howtosayno

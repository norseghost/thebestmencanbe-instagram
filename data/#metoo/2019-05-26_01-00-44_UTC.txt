Is sexual abuse of Ethiopian children prevalent in Ethiopia? Sexual assault including rape, prostitution, and child marriage of Ethiopian children are still occuring. Ethiopian children are more likely to be sexually exploited due to the displacement issue caused by a tribal war. As of October 2018, 1.5 million Ethiopians children have been displaced. In addition, Ethiopian children have higher chance to be exploited for sexual violence, because the country lacks strong child-friendly justice system and child protection systems. That’s why the #MeTooEthioipa movement is fighting to spread awareness on these issues. 
Sign the #MeTooEthiopia petition and fight for Ethiopian children to have bright futures. Sign the #MeTooEthiopia petition and fight for Ethiopian children who are suffering in silence. *****************

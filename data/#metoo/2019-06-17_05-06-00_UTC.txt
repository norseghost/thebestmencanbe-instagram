Growing up I was surrounded by men. I love men. I also gave birth to one. I have seen first hand the great capacity they have for nurturing, love and compassion. Masculinity is not a bad word, it’s the myths and rigid expectations around what it means to be a man/ boy that creates a toxic dynamics and behaviors for women, children and even the men themselves. 
@estherperelofficial says “In my work I’ve focused extensively on gender and sexuality. I’ve tried to debunk age-old myths and narrow definitions. At this moment, our main attention is being placed on the aggressive, sadistic, and predatory nature of masculinity, specifically male sexuality, and the “powerful men who harass.” But powerful men don’t harass; powerful men seduce. It’s insecure men who harass, who feel the need to use their social power to extract sex.” Parents, teachers, coaches have the honor to be in positions to raise and influence confident men. Confident men/boys are not shamed for what they like, or for their differences. Confident men/boys are uplifted every time they share a glimmer of their authentic self, their authentic emotions and encouraged to explore them both without shame of losing their “man card”. What other myths have you heard about men? How have you challenged those myths yourself?

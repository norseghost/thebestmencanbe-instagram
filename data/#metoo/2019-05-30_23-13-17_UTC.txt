Let’s talk.

This Facebook status showed up in my memories.  I got in trouble for this status.  Well, in “trouble”. And it should have been a warning sign that I was already in trouble, and it was going to get worse.

I’d had a rough day at work.  Then that afternoon this nice visitor to the office brought us a box of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee, and was nice, and it cheered me up.  I posted about it.

I left that day to find that someone I was close to was in a sulk.  What was wrong, I asked.

What was wrong was apparently that status had been a huge insult to them, as someone close to me.  Why hadn’t I posted about how THEY made my day better? How THEY made my life better? What about all THEY did for me? How could I embarrass THEM like that? How could I be so ungrateful? 
This is a thing that happened.  And it might happen to you, even though it shouldn’t and even though I hope against hope it never does.  It can be a man or a woman who does this.  You could be a man or a woman it’s done to.  Be smarter than I was.  Be braver.  Do not let someone take you away from yourself.  Do not let someone make you feel guilty for your happiness, large or small.  Do not let someone make themselves the center of your world with nothing you’re doing of any particular importance to you.  Do not let them take your identity from you.  Do not let someone ruin everything for you that isn’t about them.  Don’t let them steal you away.

You are a person.  You are you.  There isn’t anyone like you, and you have a right to the best of everything just as anyone does.  No one has the right to ruin everything for you that isn’t about them.  No one has the right to steal you from yourself. 
Be brave.  Stand.  Fight.

I know the #metoo has been used often as a voice for women out there who have been facing abuse, harassment and trauma.

Here is my story on the value of consent and what it means to be a woman. It is good to be clear with what you want on a date, from people or even a lover.

Luckily, this man did have some moral compass, but some people don’t have ANY concern for others.

It’s really sad. The world 🌍 is really scary. People can deceive you and assume a lot.

Ego is the enemy not your vagina, ladies remember this. 
This situation could have gotten out of hand, but luckily, I had a big brain and I had the balls to actually defend myself. 
However, I know so many girls out there who’ve been taught to not speak out when things happen. 
I’m glad I have people in my life who I can turn too - non judgemental and neutral individuals.

My three top lessons from this experience 
1) Men have a guard to defend because they’ve been taught vulnerability isn’t an excuse and they are worried it ‘de-masculates’ them

2) Women AND Men can both speak out about the abuse, harassment or trauma they’ve experienced. 
3) Finally, our society doesn’t really speak about the value of CONSENT and what it means to consent to something. 
Time to change! 
The truth is , even the ‘strongest’ person can sometimes be taken advantage of. And it’s not OK.

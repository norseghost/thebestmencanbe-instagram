“I’M  FED The FUCK UP ... today, yesterday, last Monday, last month, last year, 40+ years ago ... left alone, with nothing but ME, MYSELF and MY MIND filled with MASSIVE anger, pain, sadness and rage ... how do I overcome these 40+years of feelings that been deeply rooted and embedded in my body ... my soul cries out to and for ME —> “The Little 5 Years’ Young Girl” ... trying to imagine and wonder how the HELL did SHE - I - WE during those young tender years get the emotional strength and endurance to smile, sustain and survive without severing somebody ... writing, poetry, dancing, club music, house music“ ~ Little Girl Blue 6-9-2019 @ 4:33 pm “Tired of Holding This Shit In!” Dedicated to Women Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse🙏🏽

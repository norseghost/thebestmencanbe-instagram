                        "text": "Can Reversing and Preventing CANCER be this Easy?\n\nThere are a lot of foods that play a role in keeping us healthy, preventing and reversing Cancer, but NOTHING compares to cruciferous vegetables.\nOne of those phytochemicals in cruciferous vegetables is of the group called isothiocyanates, and sulforaphane (a type of isothyiocyanate), has been shown to inhibit cancer formation (carcinogenesis) in so many ways.\n\nWhy are cruciferous vegetables so powerful in preventing and reversing Breast Cancer for example?\nThere is a vital phytochemical called Indole-3-carbinol which is formed during crushing or lightly cooking these vegetables. \nThis compound acts in the following ways to reduce the risk of breast cancer: \n1) it promotes break down of estrogen\n2) it makes estrogen receptor cells in the breasts less sensitive to oestrogen \n3) it shuts down a key enzyme and in doing so stops breast cancer cells from growing and \n4) it \u2018turns on\u2019 a tumor suppression gene which inhibits tumorgenesis (tumor formation). The levels of estrogen that we are exposed to during our life time are proportional to our risk of breast cancer as well as many other hormonal cancers (ovarian, prostate, uterine, cervical). Therefore, by simply incorporating these vegetables that speed up the break down and removal of estrogen, your breast cancer risks and hormonal risks are reduced by a massive 40%!\nBroccoli\ncabbage\ncauliflower\nbok choy\nbrussel sprouts\nchard\nkale\nsprouts\nArugula \nand many more\n\nWhat form is the best form to eat them in daily? \n1. Juicing \n2. Eat raw and add raw to salads\n3. Dehydrated greens (there are so many great greens products in a dehydrated powdered form so they maintain their nutrients) \n4. Cook lightly or lightly steam- eat them or add to soups"

In the next issue of my Newsletter I write a short article about how burnout was identified by the World Health Organization as a real thing.⠀
⠀
It is time to wake the f#*k up I  our organizations and personal lives and see how we each co tribute to our own struggles.⠀
⠀
There continues to be ongoing alarm bells ringing loud that only a few are paying attention to.⠀

The list can go on and on I am sure depending on where you live in the world. ⠀
⠀
This call to action is to just wake up that part in you that wants to make a change to support a safer world.⠀
⠀
The next generations are born and watching let's not let them down.⠀

We have been busy! Busy putting the finishing touches on the final edit of the film, prepping our electronic press kit for festival submission, updating our IMDb page, and working to get press on this film! Thank you all so much for your continued support. If you havenâ€™t seen our trailer yet you can click on the link in our bio and see more info about the film on our IMDb page. This pic is the Beach Boardwalk view from the motel room we filmed at in Santa Cruz. It was really special filming in a place I have so many good memories from ðŸ’«âœ¨

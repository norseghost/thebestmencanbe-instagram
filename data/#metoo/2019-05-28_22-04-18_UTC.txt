🌟 Thank to you all the wonderful people who liked, comment and shared my silly video of me dancing to @todrick ‘s instant iconic bop, “Nails, hair, hips, heels.” 🌈 A very special “hello” to all of my new followers 🙋🏻‍♀️ I’m thrilled to have you with me, virtually, and have really enjoyed looking at all of your fun photos and videos 📸

Dancing was something I did for 20 years and I stopped when I found myself tangled in an abusive relationship 12 years ago 🕊 I started dancing again at home about six years ago when I couldn’t make sense of my emotions and had to express them physically 💃🏻 Slowly, I started sharing videos of my routines and here I am today feeling strong 💪🏼 alive 💥 and regaining my confidence ⚡️

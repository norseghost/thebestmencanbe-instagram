In light of recent news about a database of locations to approach and target women in Melbourne, we want you to know that you can share your experience with a pick up misogynist in Melbourne on www.shesacrowd.com. Geotag your story and we will collect these to inform how local venues and authorities can proactively address this disgusting attack on our right to the city. We should all be free to go about our days without being targeted in this way. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

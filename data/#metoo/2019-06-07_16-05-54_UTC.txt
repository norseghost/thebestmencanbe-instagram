I remember when my mentor said to me "it makes sense that you don't trust women. Come, sit with me- you'll see." It was true, the women in my life had been critical, bullying, judgemental or they wanted something from me. I also used to be a corporate shark who climbed bodies to the top wearing stilettos. When bosses were sexually inappropriate with me #metoo I LAUGHED & GAVE MYSELF A RAISE!! ⠀
Anyways... I've since learned to harmonize and trust women. Having real sisterhood in my life,  I've experienced what I have shared with thousands of clients. Feeling seen, understood, loved and supported allows us to bring more of that into our lives. Feeling loved and supported we can do anything. I gave what I needed.⠀
I have since helped many women feel safe with women as we lift each other up. ⠀
I'm starting 'The Women's Circle' in July if you happen to be in #vancouver Come, sit with me, you'll see. ⠀
For now - I am off to an island with some soul sisters to remind myself how far I have come to find HOME. ⠀
Maybe you can relate to this. ⠀

I love this quote by Brendon Burchard ~ seeking change always requires a touch of the insanity.  This is so true.  When you want to make change, you need to step out of your comfort zone; believe in the unknown; and take a risk in trusting in yourself.  It doesnâ€™t always work out as planned, but it definitely helps us grow as a person.  Go for it!  Make the changes you were meant to make ðŸ’œ

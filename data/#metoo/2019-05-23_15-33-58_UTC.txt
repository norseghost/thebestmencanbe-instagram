I think a lot of women are programmed to put everyone else before themselves. This is both a cultural teaching, as women are thought to be nurturers, but also something that can be taught in abusive situations, maybe the abuser made you feel less valuable and undeserving. .

Self-care is not selfish. Itâ€™s okay to prioritize yourself and your happiness! You are valuable, you are deserving. .

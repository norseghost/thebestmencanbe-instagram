There are some stories that break my heart. This is one of them. This is a recent report that uncovered how lawyers, brokers, bankers and businessman exploited immigrants in the taxi industry by selling them taxi medallions knowing fully well that they were heading towards devaluation. These same Frauds also accumulated a lot of wealth from this scheme. These immigrants were conned by grifters who pressured them to plough their life savings into purchasing the medallions without any procedural or legal steps. Some of the desperate drivers state that nothing was properly explained, with a language barrier and no legal or union  representation. Now, some of these drivers are stuck with up to a million dollar debts with no way out. ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’” #politics #feminist #feminism #london #blogger #smashpatriarchy #justice #metoo #timesup

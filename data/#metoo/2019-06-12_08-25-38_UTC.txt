In yesterday’s World Cup match, the US beat Thailand 13-0! Hopefully this is sign that we’ll see more great play from these amazing athletes. 💪🏼⚽️But what sort of culture does the US women’s national team experience at home? Are they encouraged to play? Or are they mocked? What challenges do they face in this male-dominated sport? Dr. Maya Bhave has researched these questions and her book War and Cleats is a contemporary analysis of American women in soccer. Her book features the intimate and multi-layered struggles and pressures as well as the gender battles of female players, revealing their rocky paths, their determination to stay the course, and ultimately their love for the beautiful game of soccer. #womenssoccer #womensworldcup #usawomenssoccer #youthsoccer #girlssoccer #womenathletes #bookstagram #wednesdaymotivation  #metoo

He was taken back when he found out that the baby on the way wasn\u2019t going to be the son he had always dreamed of but in fact would be a girl. What was he going to do with a daughter? He knew nothing about raising a girl and was no longer quite as excited for his new little one\u2019s arrival.\n\u2026\nIt took all of about one second to change his mind once he held his sweet Lauren in his arms.\n\u2026\nShe was a firecracker, full of life and love for everyone that she came in contact with and he was overly protective. After her mom passed away when she was ten Lauren and James grew closer. Once she reached high school, he was navigating a space he wasn\u2019t ready for and doing so alone. Unsure of what else to do James continued to stack on the rules: no dating until your 18, no phone or computer in your bedroom, curfew at 10:00pm. He thought stricter rules meant less chance of something happening to her and Lauren had always done her best to abide by them.\n\u2026\nWhen it came time for Lauren to head off to UC Davis, James was excited and worried, because he didn\u2019t know how to protect her from hours away, so he laid on a few more rules: no drugs or alcohol, no fooling around with boys, no letting your grades drop. If he heard about any of these things happening, he would no longer help her pay for school and she would no longer be welcome at home. James did strict dad well and it had always seemed to work.\n\u2026\nLauren had every intention of obeying her dad\u2019s rules while she was away at school and she did so for the first month or so until she met Cameron. He was older and lived a short distance away in Sacramento. He showered her with praise and always had sweet little presents for her, presents that there was no way she could afford. Lauren had never dated before due to her dad\u2019s rules and she was soaking in every minute she spent with Cameron, it didn\u2019t hurt the he seemed to enjoy spoiling her.\n\u2026\nLink in bio to read more."

You are accepting the sexual assaults that happen in the streets we used to play in as kids. You are accepting the misogyny that runs in men\u2019s blood. You are accepting their greed like they aren\u2019t already privileged enough, \u201cwhy isn\u2019t there an international men\u2019s day.\u201d Why isn\u2019t there equal pay? Why do have to text my girl friends to see if they got home safe? Why do we receive pictures of your dicks on our phones like it\u2019s some sort of sick surprise party?\n\nIf you are not angry you are settling. You are settling for the secretary position instead of becoming the CEO of the fucking company. When you hear the locker room talk in the break room don\u2019t settle for lunch at your desk. Pour vodka into the fire and say something, anything, but don\u2019t settle. \nThis is not to fuel a fire of hatred towards the other sex. \nThis is not to spread misandry. \nThis is to tell all my sisters out their to never settle and to never accept that we are anything less than capable. \n#feminist #girlboss #womenempoweringwomen #feministsofinstagram #feminista #poetry #poetrycommunity #slampoetry #metoo #metoomovement #timesup #csa #sexualassault #mentalhealthadvocate #mentalhealthrecovery #mentalhealthawareness #traumarecovery #traumasurvivor"

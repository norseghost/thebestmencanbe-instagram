HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HAD SEX AND DIDN‘T WANT TO?
.
Most of us lack the ability to say no and speak up for ourselves. The result is, that we get hurt. We put ourselves in abusive situations, sending out the message that we don’t deserve to be valued and loved. We are afraid of loosing another’s attention, love and care by saying no and taking care of ourselves. We put their needs in front of our own, for a false moment of self-validation, a wrong sense of self-worth. We feel loved by letting others disrespect us. That can’t be right! Where does this come from?

Probably somebody has judged or threatened you as a child when you expressed how you felt about a certain thing. Instead of help and encouragement for having your own thoughts and expressing your feelings, you received punishment. You were told it is wrong to have those feelings and that they are not true or valid. On the other hand: Saying yes to things you didn’t really want to do, and remaining quiet was being rewarded. And so they taught you that lying is better than telling the truth. And since you were little and depending on your parent’s love and approval, you adapted this strategy and obeyed to survive.

We need to encourage our little one’s and all the grown ups in this world to be able to speak their truth, without being judged or punished or laughed at for it, so there won’t be any space for abuse anymore. If we learn to say no before it’s too late, we are in a good place of self-love and self-respect with ourselves and we are able to pass it on to the next generation, and protect our children from having to silent their heart’s and minds.

Every woman and every child should have the courage and the right to say no, without fearing the consequences. Because their consequences in an abusive world like this are: being left fractured with a hurt self-image, robbed and devalued by their abusers and with low self-esteem.

That can’t be right! That can’t be what we teach our children, who will grow up and become abusers themselves, just because they don’t know anything else. They are not to blame. But we have to take responsibility now and make a change!

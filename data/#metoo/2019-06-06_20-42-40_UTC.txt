I had so many questions after being sexually assaulted. 
Why did this happen? 
Why did he do this? 
Where is God? 
Why didn't he stop it? 
What do I do now? 
Do I tell anyone? 
Do I ignore it? 
How could I be so stupid? 
How could I let this happen? 
What was the purpose? 
Why me? 
Why won't people believe me? 
Am I alone? 
Where am I now? 
Who am I now? 
Will anything ever be the same? 
Will I ever be me again?

These are just some of the many questions I had after being sexually assaulted. Some questions I got answered. Some questions I don't even have anymore, even if I didn't get answers, and some questions I will never have answered. But I have learned that questioning is okay. It is part of healing. 
You may not ever be the same, but that doesn't mean you won't be okay. You have a chance to heal into who you want to become. It is okay to feel this pain. Feeling is necessary for healing. Everyone has questions. You are not alone. ðŸ’•

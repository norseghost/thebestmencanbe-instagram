I'd like to remind you all that we are all able to celebrate #pridemonth because of a brave, black, transgender woman named Marsha P. Johnson. Its totally normal to have fun during pride, but lets not forget that pride started as a protest not a festival. Remember that many lgbtq+ individuals have died so that we are able to celebrate in the streets today. I of course want to celebrate myself and my other lgbtq+ pals, but i must not forget what pride was actually intended for. -ðŸŒ¹

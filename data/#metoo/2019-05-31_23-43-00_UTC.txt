I could pretty much be left with only these things and be content. Thank you Zeus for choosing to come back and continue to be my little Krishna. I’m so happy and proud to be your momma. What you’ve taught me in a year is just as profound as - if not more than - anything I’ve learned on my mat. And I think I’ve just invented my new summer cocktail. May your weekend bring you this much peace and contentment. #winning #friday #weekend #topangacanyon #zeus #readyforsummer #peace #contentment #relax #unwind #cocktail #kombucha #buzz #mykindofyoga

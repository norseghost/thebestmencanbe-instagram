Real talk: I had another meltdown. I've been trying to sleep since I got home from work but have just been flooded with trauma memories and flashbacks. Tbh, I really wanted to be self-destructive. Like really bad. But I've gone nearly two and  a half months without harming myself physically and I reallllly didn't want to throw that progress away. SO, I shaved all my hair off. Again. I miss my long hair but at this point, its just hair and it'll grow back. The important thing is is that I kept myself safe, again, even with how hard tonight has been. That's progress I'm proud of.ðŸŒ» #cptsd #traumasurvivor #metoo #sexualabusesurvivor #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters

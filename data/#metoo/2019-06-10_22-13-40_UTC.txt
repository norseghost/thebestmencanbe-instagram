ElephantTribe.org would like to be part of changing this narrative. We’re making films with female storytellers, where women can recognize themselves in the day-to-day life represented on screen. Seeing women in roles that are proactive, having their own ideas, not just reacting to the men around them.

Muslima Gulyamova (Director, Writer), Martina Albanelli (Editor), Akiko Shima (Actress) at the IFS Film Festival representing our film “Veins of Life” Official Selection shown at the film festival.

What a fun and proud day! 🥰

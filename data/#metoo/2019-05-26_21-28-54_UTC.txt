This is literally the saddest video I have ever watched in my life. Pls realize that we are destroying the world everyday not just for ourselves, but for the countless other species that we share the earth with. We don‚Äôt deserve the earth and all that it has provided for us, and it feels like nobody wants to do anything about it. If you believe climate change is a real problem, help fight to reduce it. Maybe one day u will wake up and realize that animals that we see every day will only be in books, or that thousands of children around the world will suffer from fatal asthma attacks due to pollution. Or maybe one day you will realize that our children and future generations will never see a clean ocean in their entire lives. Smfh what the hell are we doing. ‚Ä¢üê• ‚Ä¢

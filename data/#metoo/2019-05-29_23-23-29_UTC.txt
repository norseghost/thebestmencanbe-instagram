Growing up, I hardly knew mosques existed. The west side of LA may not have had a very obvious one in the 70s! When I visited my first Muslim country, Morocco, at age 20, these beautiful singing structures captivated me. But despite my admiration, I was upset about the segregation of men & women in the praying areas. That trip was tricky for me as a young blonde American woman getting harassed & stared at in the cafes at night & in the souks in daylight. It’s hard enough to be a privileged tourist fro the west- but my level of anxiety was beyond. I honestly didn’t eat much, sleep or poop for 5 days on that trip with my  college boyfriend. There were never local women eating out which freaked me out. I was relieved to leave and go back to France which felt slightly more comfortable, despite the piggish French pinchers I tried to avoid among other rude, abusive situations I encountered while living in Paris as an aupair! Talk about the #metoo generation, whoa! It was not that long ago, relatively speaking, but so much has happened since then. Middle Wast conflicts, Al Queda & 9-11 took it to a new level. Can we all really get along? Can women find equality on this planet whether on the streets, in the workplace or church? I hope that religions can become less oppressive and have equality within their temples. It’s not likely but one can only hope. While in Taiwan, I felt a certain wonder watching the kids play outside the mosque, planted in such a different culture! It got me thinking about Chinese Muslims & the global world we exist within! We’ve always moved around, had wars, cultivated racism ....Can we end what seems the human condition? If women can run the world, I thibk it’s possible ❤️‼️#loveyourneighbor #huimigrants #taiwantravels #futureisfemale #metoo #powertothepeople #islamicmosques #taipeimosque #chinesemuslim #taiwanesehui #worshippeacefully #teatravels #staybrave #bewhoyouare #respectwomen

CW: anxiety about sexual assault!
-
Caveat I heart *good therapy! I’ve been super lucky to have worked with some really great therapists, and it has made all the difference in my healing journey. Here’s a reminder that there’s NOTHING WRONG WITH SEEING A THERAPIST, and also if your therapist isn’t a good fit, it’s okay to switch! Your mental health is important! Also, yay celebrate growth and learning! :’) (also lol I can’t remember exactly what my therapist said but we did recap how much I’ve grown and then practice what I’ll say if I ever see him)

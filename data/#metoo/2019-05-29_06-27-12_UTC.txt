Thank you 𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐡 𝐀𝐬𝐬𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 -𝗪𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧 𝐢𝐧 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐡 𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐞 for inviting me to the Media Training/PR Panel and workshop. Hearing how these pioneering ladies are breaking down barriers in the financial (and tech) sector was inspiring. It got me thinking, what other sectors need similar initiatives? I’d love to hear from you about how you’re breaking down gender (or other) barriers in your industries. The more we can share ideas and learn, the better our society will be for it 🙏!⁣

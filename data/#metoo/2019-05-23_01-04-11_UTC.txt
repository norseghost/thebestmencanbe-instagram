One year ago today when my job thought me credible enough to be a speaker at their annual Cure Violence Gala. They thought me credible enough to talk in front of hundreds of invited guests about the impact and the model of Cure Violence. They thought me credible enough until I came forward about being sexually assaulted by their deputy director Cobe Williams and then I'm not so credible anymore according to the University of Illinois office of Access and Equity but of course they have a whole lot to lose. In fact I heard from a little birdie that most every sexual assault sexual harassment case campus-wide that is filed with the University of Illinois office of Access and Equity magically is deemed unfounded. 
Something to think about.

ABOUT:
'Rise Again Project' is an anti-rape campaign that is centred on the song 'Rise Again' by Libby Ndambo.

Part of the campaign is sharing survivor stories. The first story, "Survivor Story #1" (YouTube link in @libby_ndambo bio), broke Libby's heart when it was first shared with her. "To see her strength and will power to heal and find peace was admirable," Libby says.

If you would like to support or be a part of the 'Rise Again Project' feel free to reach out to Libby Ndambo (@libby_ndambo) on +254 799 863 857.

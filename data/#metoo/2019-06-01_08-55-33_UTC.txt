Good Morning My Fierce Fabulous Family  its simply Saturday here's Today's quote 
Man may be a social animal but socializing is not always ideal. There are times when you should be spending some alone time. Being alone with yourself at certain times of day to reflect on your life is the best way to understand and be aware of yourself. Moreover, in times of anguish or anxiety, if you find a suitable place to be alone like a park or a beach, or even a forest path, it can work wonders for your soul. You deserve that peace and quietness to be at one with your soul.

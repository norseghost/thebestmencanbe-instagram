I think I need:\nDisclaimer:\nI\u2019ll probably lose some of you for this but please know that it\u2019s not personal. Nothing I put out in the inter webs of insta is meant to be taken personally.\n\u2014\nHow do we feel about these abortion bans fam? How do we feel about being told our #metoo is a joke? How do we feel about prisoners being given lupron AS A PUNISHMENT when we\u2019re told it\u2019s a \u201ccure\u201d? How do we feel about all the doctors who said it was all in our heads? How do we feel about the wage gap? How do we feel about being told to sit down because we look too young?\nHOW DO WE FEEL AS WOMEN?!\n\u2014\nI\u2019ll tell you - I don\u2019t feel good about it. And it\u2019s even WORSE for women of color. It just breaks my heart.\n\u2014\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that in times like these we HAVE to write our senators, representatives, and congress. Because if we don\u2019t, behaviors like the ones listed above are just going to continue.\n\u2014\nI used to ask \u2018what can I even do for something like this?\u2019 - WRITE A LETTER!!\nThen I used to say \u2018A letter takes forever to write\u2019 - well fortunately (unfortunately) there are A LOT of examples out there we can use as templates. So use that google device you have in your hand right now and look one up! We HAVE to speak up and be loud because if we aren\u2019t, our BASIC HUMAN rights will slowly dwindle away.\n\u2014\nThere\u2019s so much I have to say. I understand that there are still clinics open, I understand things have been put in place. BUT SOMETHING IS STARTING.\nThey say a picture can say 1000 words so there you have it.\nSCREW YOU AND YOUR OPINIONS OF *MY* UTERUS!\n\u2014\nThanks for coming to today\u2019s ted talk.\nI hope to see you at the next one.\n\u261d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffc\u270c\ud83c\udffc\n\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udda4\n.\n.\nspecial shoutout to @gramirezp for taking this photo for me from the pool + @megs_holborn for gifting me this wonderful pin! Love you both so much!!!! \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\ude18\n.\n#endometriosis #adenomyosis #pcos #overiesbeforebroveries #medicaltrauma #ovaries #uterus #PEOPLEPERIOD #nirmalizeperiods #normalizemenstruation #metoo #nouterusnoopinion #mybodymydecisions #feminist #femalepower #hearmeroar #canttellmeno #dontstopmenow #endowarrior #endosistersunite #acog #bebetter #humanrights #humanactivist"

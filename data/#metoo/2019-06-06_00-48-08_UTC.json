I didn\u2019t even know it existed until ... today. \ud83d\ude02\n.\nI really started running in high school. Back then it was about being thin. I ran in my freshman year of college. Back then it was about being thin.\n.\nAnd then, my sophomore year of college, shit hit the fan. I endured some devastating stuff. Some stuff I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone. I found freedom in running and I found grace in running.\n.\nFour years after that, I\u2019d experience a breakup that led me to say \u201cfuck it\u201d and sign up for a half marathon. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f And seriously ... the rest is history \ud83d\ude02\n.\nSince then, I\u2019ve been running. And since then, it\u2019s been about freedom. Power. Some control. Balance. Love. Grit. Determination. Perseverance. Integrity.\n.\nNo one is stalking your workouts making sure you do it all. No one is there to cheer you on in the heat of summer during your threshold run. No one is holding a finish line tape at the end of a long run. It\u2019s just you. YOU have to motivate yourself. YOU have to find something within yourself that pushes onward.\n.\nRunning gave me freedom when I felt trapped and when I was buried. It gave me something to look forward to. Something to remind my body that I can do hard things. I can do things people say I can\u2019t. I can push myself to my limits and passed what I ever imagined they\u2019d be.\n.\nRunning has evolved for me so many times that I truly can\u2019t fathom it or explain it all.\n.\nI am so grateful for this sport. Happy running day, fam. \ud83d\udc96\n.\n#runnersofinstagram #globalrunningday #runners #headupwingsout #oiselle #womenofinstagram #womensupportwomen #womenrunners #irunthisbody #ihavearunnersbody #longrun #halfmarathon #halfmarathontraining #5k #5ktraining #metoo #run #runhappy #runningsavesmysoul #runningsavedme"

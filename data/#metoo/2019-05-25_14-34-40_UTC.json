That my duty was to create an unwanted human and nurture it through incubation, which includes not only months and months of discomfort, but potentially life-threatening complications. .\nAnd THEN to either allow other people to take it from me, or be attached to a man I didn\u2019t want to be attached to forever, while sacrificing my life to care for this being I never wanted. \nSo guess what? I wanted it to never come into being. I am deeply grateful to all the chickens who supported me. \nAnd then, ya know what? I would forget about it. For long periods of time. When someone brought up pregnancy, I\u2019d remember, oh - I was pregnant too. It didn\u2019t bother me. I didn\u2019t have strong emotions around it. It was just something that happened. And I was relieved.\n.\n.\n\ud83d\uddbc @drawingsofdogs"

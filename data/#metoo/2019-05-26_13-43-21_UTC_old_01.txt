Guiding principle for our Men's offerings: "Men don't like being told what to do... Much worse is not knowing what to do"

So this retreat is going to be right in the middle.

Healing the male experience in this culture means creating a safe AND challenging place. The call to push oneself must come from within, and that awakens the deepest bravery.

Being with others in a similar, slightly challenging but totally welcoming environment almost always leads to good stuff!

Also,
 it's gonna be fun!

Going through healing means revisiting feelings and events that are not your favorite place to visit. As a result, you will have some really tough days and nights throughout the process. Sometimes you can even feel like you're moving backward or in the wrong direction. Healing from whatever life wound you have is worth going through the pain though. There is hope on the other side. #treesofhopefl

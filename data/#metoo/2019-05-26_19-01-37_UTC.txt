A young girl sells balloons at Ganpati at Juhu Beach in Mumbai. When I took this image last year, it was in the midst of #metoo turmoil across the world and close to home in some of the organizations I dearly love in India. I wrote them that looking at this image, “it strikes me that in the midst of murkiness there is still a bright offering. Light is still so very present. Offered perhaps by the unlikeliest of people, in nuanced situations that seem impossibly dark.” Still true today. May you be that offering.  May we be that offering to each other. Happy Sunday.

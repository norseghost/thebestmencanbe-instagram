Is it possible we have created a culture that honors relating in our struggles more than transforming ourselves for good?  When one of our biggest mutual fears is being alone, I believe somehow we find more comfort in the fact that we’re not the only one, than we do in what it would take to be the one who overcame. Let’s be real, there are many more of us who find comfort in each other’s misery, than we do with someone else’s growth and success.

Are you someone who could be doing so much more in life, but you’re afraid to face what is holding you back?  Do you know you surround yourself with people who need you, so you don’t have to be challenged in your own unmet needs? Do you use your vulnerability to seek out people who relate with you, rather than people who can truly help you?
.
I believe we are becoming more aware that our emotional ups and downs, our grief, or our deepest challenges are part of being human, and has nothing to do with our worthiness or potential. But, being human isn’t the reason you’re joyless, or ungrateful, or empty. 
Being human isn’t the obstacle to accessing the Power that is within you to create and receive everything you’ve been wired to desire.

It’s true that once you commit to a healing path, your tribe may change. For me, to heal depression, I couldn’t hang around other depressed people any longer. To heal self esteem, I didn’t participate in self annihilating conversations any more. To heal codependence, I had to let go of the ones who demanded it from me. It was a lot of loss. But, looking back, it’s interesting how little I missed them or suffered for not having them in my life.

If you look at your own life, you may find people who add value for your reflection, but not for your future. They’re not living the mindset or the life that supports where you’re going or who you were born to be. Not everyone was assigned to your future, that’s why they stay in your past, where they once related with you. But eventually, they are the ones who will become inspired by you, if you let yourself become one of the few, who chooses a path that must be better than the one you’re on.

This says it all . Don’t judge someone because you don’t know them. Don’t judge someone because someone told you something. Don’t let anyone bring you down because you wanted to be safe and you wanted to protect yourself and your child. No one should be hated,no one should be abused, no one should be put down,no one should be called names ,no one should be abuse humiliated manipulated. Every relationship is different doesn’t mean that another person can’t hurt someone else. If you have an open your eyes and realize that the same person that treats you good can treat someone wrong you are as narcissistic as that person you love to live that life of the head and hurt. I do not live in a heart I am going to speak up and I will not let anyone hurt me or tell me that things have not happen when they have done so. #strongwoman#follow#momblog#momblogger#mystory#followmyjourney#iwillnotbesilent#metoo#domesticviolence#abusesurvivor#verbalabuse#physicalabuse#mentalabuse#letstalkaboutit

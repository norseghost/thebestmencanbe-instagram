The media portrays sexual assault as something that only occurs when young women wear short skirts in nightclubs, carried out by unattractive older men. This idea however, while true in many real-life cases, is not the definition. In fact, sexual assault is defined as an act in which a person intentionally sexually touches another person without their consent, or forces a person to engage in a sexual act against their will through coercion or physical force.

Nowhere in this definition is a gender specified, nor an age, ethnicity, or background. And that is because anybody can both commit these acts, and also fall victim to them.

If you have a body? Then you can be a victim of abuse. It doesn't matter what's between your legs, how long you've been on this earth, or what sort of person you are.

This body you see before you? This body has been abused.

I was not physically pinned down by a strong, powerful man I met in a club as society's paradigm might suggest. Instead, I was coerced and manipulated into sexual activity after making it clear that I did not want to, by a girl I had known for a long time.

It has taken years for me to accept that this happened. It's something that I have never spoken about, until now. But somebody asked me this question recently, and I thought it was time to share.

So can men really be sexually assaulted? Yes, we can be.
But we can also learn to live again. We can also make something of ourselves. We can be strong, not by "manning up" - keeping quiet and burying our emotions, but by acknowledging our pain, raising our voices for those who can't, and changing the way people think about trauma & mental health.

Thank you for reading, this one wasn't easy ðŸ’™

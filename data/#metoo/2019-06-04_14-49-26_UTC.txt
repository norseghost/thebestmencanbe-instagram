I never knew how strong I was until I had to forgive someone who never said sorry and accept an apology I never received.♡

A dear friend gave me some amazing advice. When I opened up to her about a struggle I was having in terms of forgiveness and healing,  she suggested I write a letter. Something I had considered but felt uncomfortable but then she said "you don't have to mail it"-just write it all out so you can begin to heal. It was like a light came on and I realized yes. I can do this! All the hurt and anger and pain I've been wanting to let go of but just never felt ready and always felt still so beyond broken, finally I can purge this and move forward. Move away from those memories that still haunt me and break free to live in the light and shut the door to the darkness. Abuse is an ugly thing and if you have never experienced it you are blessed. But if you are like me and you are a SURVIVOR then lift your head up, write it out, forgive the one who hurt you, look towards the light of a new day and close that chapter because honey it does NOT define you. You are better than that. You will be ok and you will move on. One step at a time. Chase your happiness... it's well within your reach.{♡}

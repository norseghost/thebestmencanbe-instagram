🌼 MARY QUANT & THE MINISKIRT REVOLUTION— so we know the V&A has launched its retrospective of Mary Quant's work but... how has our view of the 60s fashion designer and her iconic miniskirt changed in the post-#MeToo era? The miniskirt was and remains extremely political- just consider critics who claim wearing super-high hemlines is akin to consent or an invitation for upskirting. I love this line from Taylor Jenkins Reid’s novel Daisy Jones & The Six where Daisy, dressed in Mary Quant-Style hot pants, argues that women should be able to dress as they please away from the male gaze. “I run hot and I always have. I’m not going to sit around sweating my ass off just so men can feel more comfortable. It’s not my responsibility to not turn them on. It’s their responsibility to not be an asshole”. Touché.

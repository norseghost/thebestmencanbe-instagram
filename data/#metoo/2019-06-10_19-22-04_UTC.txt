I have to check myself when I call myself an abuse survivor because there is NOTHING about what I’m doing with my life that is about surviving.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I’m absolutely thriving.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It’s taken a whole lot of work to get to this point, and I can’t tell you that the road has been easy.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It still isn’t easy right now. I still have nightmares. I still cry.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The aftershocks are still there and I grieve for parts of my life I’ll never get back.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The amount of unloving things you tell yourself as a child suffering abuse turns into beliefs that have taken me 20 years to unravel.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I still don’t fully believe I’m there.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But what I can tell you is this… Every day I CHOOSE not to be a victim but to be a victor.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
And it wasn’t because I didn’t want my abuser to “win” something over me, it was because I believe I’ve been put on this planet for a reason and being a victim wasn’t that.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As my friend Callum says, your story is either the weight on your shoulders or the wings on your back.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
That’s the only choice you have.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I choose to be happy.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I choose to embrace my story and share it even when I don’t want.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I choose to speak my truths so that those with no voices feel heard too.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I choose to let the past fade into bad chapters of an incredible story.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I choose to fill my life with meaning.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I choose to lead with LOVE.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I choose to forgive.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
To those that on the path to healing… I love you. There’s peace and joy on the horizon, I promise xx⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

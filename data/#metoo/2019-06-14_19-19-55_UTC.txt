Our #weekendread this week is NIRVANA IS HERE by Aaron Hamburger from @threeroomspress!
.
For Ari Silverman, the past has never really passed. After 20 years, the trauma from a childhood assault resurfaces as he grapples with the fate of his ex-husband, a colleague accused of sexually harassing a student. To gain perspective, Ari arranges to reconnect with his high school crush, Justin Jackson, a bold step which forces him to reflect on their relationship in the segregated suburbs of Detroit during the 1990s and the secrets they still share.

An honest story about recovery and coping with both past and present, framed by the meteoric rise and fall of the band Nirvana and the wide-reaching scope of the #metoo movement, Nirvana is Here explores issues of identity, race, sex, and family with both poignancy and unexpected humor. Deftly told intertwining stories with rich, real characters are reminiscent of the sensuality and haunting nostalgia of André Aciman’s Call Me By Your Name blended with the raw emotion of Kurt Cobain’s lyrics.

“Nirvana is Here is a beautiful, but sad, coming-of-age story that is a heartily welcome addition to the LGBTQ literature pantheon.” — review by I Like to Read

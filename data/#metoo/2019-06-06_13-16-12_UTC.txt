I never really talked about the meaning behind my back tattoo. I wanted it to feel powerful. Both of the witchs are a part of me; one funny one serious. When I was 17 I was rapped and was really sad for 3 years. It took me a lot to love myself again and forgive my assaulter. When I finally stoped being sad about this horrifying experience I decided to reward myself with this beautiful armor. It makes me feel like a really powerful woman and i love it. #metoo #strongwoman

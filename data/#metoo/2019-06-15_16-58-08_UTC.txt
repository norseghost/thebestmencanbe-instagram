This past week has been one of the hardest and most stressful I've lived through, in crown court for almost the whole week......re-living many terrible things, talking about traumatic experiences myself and someone very very close has lived through, but now it's done.....after nearly two years of dreading this week, it's been and it's gone, and I survived it. And, our abuser has been found guilty. At last, the people who matter, who judge fairly and correctly....have saw this man for who he truly is , and what he did, and justice will be done, he's guilty. Of course I know this, my friends and family knew this.....and now the courts know this and those that make laws and govern know.
This week has proved to me I am stronger than I ever thought I was, and I'm a survivor.

So now it's over, I smile. .

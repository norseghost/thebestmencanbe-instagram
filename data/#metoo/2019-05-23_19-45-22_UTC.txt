I've learned this over the past two years or so with the help of a sponsor and counselor. I used to be full of self pity.They would not enable my negative bs. I used to be a lot more ashamed. I have had ppl I thought I'd know forever lie to, judge me and play with my heart. I have had cancer. I have had body image issues. I am a recovering alcoholic. I am an overqualified #metoo member. I have been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety and ADD. I don't give a flying fuck who knows anymore. I know the pain has from time to time inspired someone else to keep pushing on. It makes these experiences have purpose. I had back to back nightmares of a prior situationship last two days. And I must be really powerful bc the dark forces in life really wanna test my resilience here. I must have a great husband in the future for all the lessons I've learned about myself and disappointments. I must be about something bc I have felt like I am nothing. I have a handful of friends. I have shelter and transportation. I have multiple talents. I have a big beautiful "damaged" heart too stubborn to officially throw in the towel like I promised. There's this fine peice of tail I've met. This week he sent me the most uplifting message maybe I've ever received. It made my week. Many more overcomes to come ðŸ˜Ž

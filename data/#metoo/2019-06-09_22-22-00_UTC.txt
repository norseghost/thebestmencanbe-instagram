HELP MAKE STRANGULATION A FELONY AND STEP PARENTS PROTECTED UNDER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS IN EVERY STATE!

People who live a lie lose track of track of their lies...being strangled and having to deal with someone lying about it after is a ridiculous thing to live through. I am so happy this part of my life is over but I feel for the women it happens to every day in this country. To our friends, sisters, mothers, aunties, children... everyday this happens worldwide.

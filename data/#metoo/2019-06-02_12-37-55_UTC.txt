My visit to the Monument Quilt. “The Monument Quilt is a public healing space by and for survivors of rape and abuse. It is a collection of more than 3,000 stories from survivors of sexual and domestic violence and their allies, written, painted and stitched onto red quilt squares. Our stories are displayed in city and town centers to create and demand public space to heal. The quilt resists the popular and narrow narrative of how sexual violence occurs by telling many stories, not one. The quilt builds a new culture where survivors are publicly supported, rather than publicly shamed.” Learn more: upsettingrapeculture.com

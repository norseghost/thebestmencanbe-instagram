Dear man, 
You tried to take away my worth. 
You saw me as an item to be used. 
You didn’t bother to listen to my soft “no.”
You hurt my body. 
Even when I cried out for you to stop, 
You kept going until you broke me. 
You didn’t care about the reprocussions. 
You gave no heed. 
You didn’t know what would happen to me 
You didn’t even care. 
At all. 
You tried, but you did not succeed. 
You do not control my future. 
You do not get to decide my value. 
You cannot break me. 📸 @erjphotog

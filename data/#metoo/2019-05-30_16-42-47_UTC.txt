Survivorsand supporters have enough to worry about when working together to heal from sexual assault. The additional burden of caring for an unplanned child can exponentially worsen trauma. Weâ€™re in this fight together. Our voices can evoke change. Contact your Congressman or Congresswoman and Senators to let them know that things need to change.

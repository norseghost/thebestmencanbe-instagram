Team work makes the dream work! Just because you're a #solopreneur or you and your #cofounder are still working on your apartment sofa at nights, doesn't mean that you don't have a team. Your team doesn't have to be full time employees that work for you, tap into your community and industry connections. Don't be afraid to reach out to others for help... 9 times out of 10 they're wont only be happy to help, but will have actually been hoping you'd ask for a while now!

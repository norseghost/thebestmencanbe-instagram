THE PERFECTION (Netflix 2019): ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
A twisted, WTF, completely unpredictable, over the top, and utterly original exploitation of the #MeToo era. 
Watching it as a woman, you’re very likely going to feel weirdly empowered by the time the final plot twist, and the ending, got through-the-roof bonkers. 🤣
I can’t say much more about it so that you have to see it for yourself.
Preprare yourself for some gross-out scenes.

Btw, after #GetOut and #ThePerfection, I think I’ve got a bit of girly crush on Allison Williams 😍

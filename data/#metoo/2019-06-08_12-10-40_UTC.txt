the 2017 #metoo hashtags following harvey weinstein’s sexual assault allegations was not what started the movement.  twenty years earlier in 1997, TARANA BURKE, haunted by stories of sexual abuse of young girls, spent ten years working hard to create a non-profit organisation to support sexual assault and harassment victims. she founded a movement and named it MeToo. 
#MeToo won’t end sexual harassment but it’s the hope that victims won’t feel alone and perpetrators as untouchable; it’s going to take a long time for them to care about the ethics of assaulting someone but at least for now they will care about the possible repercussions.

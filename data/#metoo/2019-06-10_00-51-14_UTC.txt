I’ve been so afraid to share this video 😪⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
It’s a month old, but it’s still heavy on my heart because I have yet to, wholeheartedly, release my anguish.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
I used to be a Daddy’s girl, and yet, he was the first, and LAST man to break my heart.
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Being 22, going on 23, I look back at my younger years and question the authenticity of our relationship.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
My father has generational demons that haunt him and manifest into perversion and delusion. Any woman that crosses his path has to bear the weight of his wrath.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
He’s a narcissist. He believes the world is out to get him. He hurts people before they even THINK to hurt him. He has a chemical imbalance. The generation before him didn’t break the abusive, perverted, ill-spirited curse, so his DNA got tainted by his Life Force. Sadly, he didn’t accept help when he most needed it.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
And this is what I’m currently struggling with.. Accepting help without subjecting myself to the “I’m so sorryyy for what happened to you!”.. Accepting help without questioning ones intention because my father always said “Sorry”, but never lived up to it.. Accepting love and care because I’m expecting to be neglected.. Accepting help without hearing somebody judge my situation before they heal their own..⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Nonetheless, I’m inching closer to getting therapeutic help. My bond with God is what keeps my soul attached to this body.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
I’m using this platform as a means to banish those demons that humiliate me, terrify me, and sicken me. I’m not sure if I’m saying #MeToo , but I’m sure of myself when I say my future children will not endure the pain that I(’ve) experience(d).⁣⁣⁣⁣

Spirit was leading me to #Expose those demons. This is my journey ✨⁣

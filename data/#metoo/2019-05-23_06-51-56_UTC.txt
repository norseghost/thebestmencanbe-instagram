The tender podcast.
1 in 4 women will experience intimate partner violence in the US (NCADV), globally about 1 in 3 (WHO).
And while there are many organisations targeting this issue, it’s usually about the same three things: how to recognise abuse, how to prepare for leaving, leaving. Those are totally valid issues, don’t get me wrong but concentrating on them leaves a large part of the problems people face after leaving undiscussed and to me it just always felt a bit strange. 
So, when a close friend told me about the tender podcast by Madison Griffiths I was pretty sure it was going to be the same, or there’d be detailed descriptions of how they were abused with harsh noises and lots of screaming for shock value. Because that’s the other kind of “resource” there is, catering to those who like true crime but don’t think it’s quite raw enough. 
Tender was very different from what I expected. It’s soft, careful and discusses delicate issues with the necessary caution; and while listening I recognised myself in so many episodes. From struggling to get a haircut to unwanted phone calls to adopting a puppy to nightmares that just won’t fade. And while I’ve been putting off listening to the last two episodes of this season, I can only recommend this podcast to anyone who needs a friendly voice to tell them that they’re not alone. This podcast is a great resource for those going through abuse, for those who left and for literally anyone who’d like to understand their friend who’s going through a tough time.

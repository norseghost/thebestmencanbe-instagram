"Monica, 29, stabbed", "Pascale, 56, killed by a bullet", "Taina, 20, beaten to death with an iron bar", "Séverine, 46, strangled", "Isabelle, 50, stabbed". With inscriptions painted in black on the activist chests, one for each murdered woman, FEMEN rang the alarm for the 50 victims of patriarchal terrorism in France already this year. They chanted,”Pas une de plus!” and “aux femmes assassinés la patrie indifférente” which translates to “not one more! and “to the murdered women, the nation is indifferent” Each standing on a column in the Royale Palace courtyard, the activists demanded the inscriptions in marble of the names of forgotten women in a national necropolis.

If we did this action in the US, we would need more than 2000 activists to represent all the murdered trans and cis women in America in 2019. 🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽

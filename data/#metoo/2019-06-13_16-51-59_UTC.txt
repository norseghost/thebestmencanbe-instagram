A lot of people assume this poem is about rape culture and the #metoo movement and that is a fair interpretation. But what about the Native Americans that we selfishly pushed out of their homes? They always say no and try to protect their land, but we still persist. Persistence isn’t always an admirable characteristic. Whether it’s sex or genocide, when someone says no: listen. Even if it’s as simple as someone forcing a relationship between two people who just aren’t meant to be.

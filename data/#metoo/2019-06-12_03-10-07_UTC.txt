Survivors express themselves in many voices as they travel through recovery.

I’m sure that our loved ones and therapists would prefer that we could just talk it out, but it’s not that simple.

When I learned to distinguish the differences, I began to understand which part of myself was doing the talking. 
It also allowed me to examine my emotions and what caused them. 
As I became more practiced at interpreting all of the things happening inside of me, I was then able to start reaching for tools to cope.

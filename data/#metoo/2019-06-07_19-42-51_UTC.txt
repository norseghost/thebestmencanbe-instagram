My favorite summer job to this day, was being a summer camp supervisor.  At the time it paid really well and it was 40 hour plus a week.  The best part was I didn’t have to work nights and weekends.  What better job is there then you are in year first year of college? Working for a parks and recreation department is what gave me a love for recreation and leisure studies.  If it wasn’t for my after school and summer camp jobs, I am not sure if I would have ever gotten a masters degree in recreation management.  I wouldn’t be doing what I am doing today.  I will forever be thankful for the recreation department that gave me my first job in recreation.  What was your first summer job?

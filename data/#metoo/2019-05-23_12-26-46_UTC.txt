Before #MeToo it was US FIRST! 
The only #Politics that pertain to #African(#Black) #People are the Politics of Revolution. #American #Africans(#Black People) do not share the same #History as other #Americans, and thus American Africans do not share the same #interests as other Americans. American Africans have different #Social, #Cultural, and #Economic needs, that cannot be met under the same #Capitalist system that largely introduced #Africans to the Americas as the #property of #Wealthy non-African People.

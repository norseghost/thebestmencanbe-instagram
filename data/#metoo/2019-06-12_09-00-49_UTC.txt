#InTheNews: Keanu Reeves has been receiving significantly more time under the social media spotlight recently, a change of pace for the reserved and privacy-loving superstar. The @johnwickmovie and Matrix acting veteran has been beloved by fans for years, but now women on cyberspace seem to be developing even greater respect and adoration for Reeves. 
People are now noting that Reeves always keeps his hands to himself whenever female fans are being photographed with him. While some assume that Reeves is reserving physicality to avoid being entrenched in a #MeToo controversy, many others are certain the actor is simply being the gentleman he‚Äôs always been. 
As a Jia Wood Day Master, one could say Reeves is a proponent of old-fashioned chivalry. Jia Wood can be liable to being ‚Äúbehind the times‚Äù, but in this case Reeves‚Äô traditional sense of respect and consideration for women is ironically refreshing!

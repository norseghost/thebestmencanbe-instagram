#everydaysexism I'm a cashier in my local store and just yesterday as I was working I told a man I couldn't wait to get home and mow the lawn to take advantage of our beautiful weather. He said "don't you have a husband to do that for you?" My response? "What makes you think I need one?" There are simple examples of how we can try to change the way people think everyday! #mayaangelou #womenveteran #womensrightsarehumanrights #womensrights #standtogether #sexist #sexism #metoo #womenstrong #womanup #youhaveavoice #survivor #domesticviolencesurvivor #maritalrapesurvivor #womensupportingwomen

#travel  One of my favorite countries to visit.  I recently visited for my fifth time.  The #tattoo women of Chin State.  And old practice of putting tattoos on women's faces, has for most part ended.  This woman is in her 90s and plays the flute, but with her nose.  A unique skill. .

Myanmar, formally known as Burma, is located in South East Asia, surrounded by Bangladesh, India, China, Laos, and Thailand, and the ocean. Yangon used to be the capital, but now it has moved to Naypyidaw.  Nearly 60 million people live here, and mostly Buddhist, but it is incredibly diverse, with different ethnic groups, religions, and languages.

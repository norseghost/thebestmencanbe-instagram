// OUR CAPACITY TO BE RESILIENT IS THE FOUNDATION FOR A GOOD LIFE //
〰️Ashley Jagroo

“ I didn’t just shut down in relationships. I shut down in every aspect of my life. 🍃 It was too hard to be present and have a normal conversation. 🍃 I felt like this thing was suffocating me. 🍃 I turned down so many opportunities - I couldn’t fathom having to deal with anything else, because I wasn’t addressing my trauma.” 🍃
〰️
“Every single time I’ve shared my story, someone comes up to me, and says, ‘that exact same thing has happened to me too. Thank you for giving me permission to talk about it’.”
〰️
Listen to Ashley talk about her desire to experience love and intimacy again, and about her journey - of learning that she needed to develop a deep sense of SELF-LOVE, before opening herself up to trusting and loving again.
〰️
Ashley has gone on to create THE SHAKTI FOUNDATION 💜 A non-profit dedicated to empowering women and girls in Trinidad & Tobago, and beyond.

It was a flawed rendition of the four practice jumps Sonya d'Artois (originally Butt) had under her belt before undertaking the riskiest assignment of her life. But given the rumours she'd heard about others being shot or captured the moment they landed, her jump on May 29 1944 - nine days before D-Day - was still a success \u2022 D'Artois's assignment as a secret agent behind those lines was never going to be easy: there were setbacks, mishaps and near misses that nearly cost her life \u2022 Trained at the SOE as an explosives expert, she would prove an effective instructor for French Resistance Fighters on the ins and outs of destroying rail lines and communications lines. She also covered countless kilometres on bicycle as a courier, recruiter, co-ordinator and intelligence gatherer \u2022 But her subsequent accomplishments in helping the French Resistance sabotage German efforts, along with the clandestine work of hundreds of other female agents, helped the Allied forces make their the D-Day landings on June 6 1944, and ultimately win the Second World War \u2022 D'Artois was one of 3,000 secret \u201dWarrior Women\u201d of Britain's Special Operations Executive (SOE), founded in 1940 at Churchill's request \u2022 #warriorwoman #secretagent #nazioccupiedfrance #airborne #parachute #covert #nightops #wwii #ww2 #worldwar2 #dday #military #militaryhistory #frenchresistancefighters #combat #explosives #bomb #operator #operatorlife #rifle #handgun #war #pewpew #brave #warrior #badass #hero #metoo #zerodarkops"

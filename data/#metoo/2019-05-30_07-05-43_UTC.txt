ðŸ¤¬Hitting a child should be guaranteed prison time no matter the reason!

This pisses me off so badly. If you have to hit a child the YOU have failed as a parent. It's illegal for me to walk up to an adult and punch them in the face. No matter how misbehaved they are I cannot kick, slap, choke, or slam an adult without massive repercussions and yet it's deemed socially acceptable to take a belt which in the court of law would be considered a weapon if I used it against an adult and lay it to a child's skin. This is fucking archaic and unbelievable to me. How is it that this is even a conversation we are still having.

If you hit a child fuck you...come hit me. #thinkunbroken

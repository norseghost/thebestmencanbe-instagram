Think history doesn’t matter to your life? Feel like people like you are left out, under appreciated, or even demonized in history? Fed up with the narrative that only straight white men are important in history? Me too. That’s why I started a blog. My goal is to feature underrated heroes and figures weekly to prove that history is important to all of us, and more importantly, there are historical heroes of every race, gender, sexuality, political orientation, and religion.

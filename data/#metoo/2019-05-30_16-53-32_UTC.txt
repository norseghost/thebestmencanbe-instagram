As an activist Officiant I resist ideological oppression. Canadian Law is Pro-Choice, and we have a responsibility to maintain and lend aid to that right. Those in the USA seeking healthcare are encouraged to legally come to Canada. A network of social assistance is available to you without prejudice as a visitor or refugee. The Left must unite to vote out governmental ideological conservatism.

All too often as women, we're taught to care about others' opinions and how much we're liked. People in general spend SO much time and energy on what others think.

If this resonates with you, I have news for you... If you haven't pissed someone off, you're probably not fully stepping into your power.

If you haven't had others disagree with you, you're probably not owning your thoughts, opinions, and voice.

If you haven't had others question your goals, dreams, and direction, you're probably not thinking big enough.

Your dreams should be scary. They should be risky. Your opinions deserve to be expressed-- out loud.

This is how you change the world. Say it. Own it. Live it.

Godspeed.

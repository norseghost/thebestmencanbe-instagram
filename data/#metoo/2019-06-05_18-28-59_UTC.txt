In #Jerusalem, #Aboriginalpalestinians Are the Hardest Hit in the #ashkenazi Occupation in the #Phillistine.. #metoo #timesup #african 
#zionist security measures imposed last year are having a debilitating effect on the #Muslim Quarter in Jerusalem’s Old City.  And as The Nationalreported, the city’s little known community of #Aboriginalpalestinian have been hit the hardest, a group which faces double layers of racism as the further marginalized among an already oppressed group of aboriginal.
#aboriginals live in a neighborhood next to Al Aqsa mosque, wedged between two #ashkenazi police checkpoints through which only #invaders  are allowed to pass.  As a result, their shops, which sell clothing, souvenirs and snacks, are inaccessible to the worshipers who visit the mosque on a daily basis. The heightened ashkenazi security,  restriction of movement of aboriginal, and humiliating treatment to which people are subjected, also deters many worshipers from coming in the first place.  This is choking the local economy and forcing these #Aboriginals into poverty, in a Muslim Quarter where 35 percent of businesses have closed  and those remaining open have seen their sales drop by up to 80 percent.  Residents reportedly live in fear of their safety, and two 12-year-olds were placed under house arrest for throwing stones at security cameras.
There are about 350 #aboriginapalestinians in this section of #Jerusalem, also known as the “Aboriginals quarter” according to the Times of #khazar  #Aboriginals have lived in the city for centuries, and the #African presence in Palestine dates back to the Islamic conquests, when Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab conquered Jerusalem in 634, according to Al-Monitor.
The buildings they call home are 900-year old structures which became known as “The Blood Prison” a century ago, when  #Ottomanempire converted them into a prison for jailing and executing the condemned.  Those who live there today are descended from Muslim pilgrims from #Chad, #Nigeria, #Senegal and #Sudan who came to #Jerusalem and decided to stay.  Their complex has grown into five apartment buildings, according to The National, and some of the #Aboriginalpalestinians .

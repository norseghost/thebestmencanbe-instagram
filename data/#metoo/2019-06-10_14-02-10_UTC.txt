Agree? Or do you love the term “self care”? Tell us 👇🏽👇🏿👇🏾👇🏼 .
I personally really dig this sentiment. It seems change for women will require something bigger. • Think about this: as a society, our interest in a pregnant woman is considerable. But when she does not have a child or once her body bears a new life, we shift the gaze. We even censor images of her role in birth. There are deep-seated reasons for this. • And then we focus on the baby, forgetting the woman, and lose interest as a woman ages. • So yes, we need to value ourselves and tell our stories and look after our wellness in order to be a part of a sweeping change in culture. But a massive shift is needed. And we need to band together to make that change. • At Totum, we are working to shift the paradigm. We are part of a movement that you’re in, too. It will be uncomfortable and will require us to value ourselves. Self care is one expression of that. But we need to look after one another and support one another, look beyond ourselves. This shift will require us to work together, it will require teamwork. It will be as big a cultural shift as what began with the #metoo movement. And it’s all related. • For when we live in a society that truly values a woman, her worth will extend beyond her youth, her appearance, her fertility, and her “baby bump.” • We are here to help women reclaim being whole. Caring for ourselves so we can care for one another is a big part of that. But this term needs a little bit of a rebrand when our work is so big. That’s our view. We want to hear yours, too.

here I am before i knew I'd have to fight for my reproductive rights my entire life. Before I knew women weren't paid equally as men. Before I learned how to fight so when someone sexually harassed me I'd be ready if needed. Before I was assaulted and too afraid to prosecute bc i was asked "What did you say to him before...lead him to believe anything?" That same little girl is now happy to fight alongside her brothers and sisters for equality and justice; to help the next generation feel safer and stronger. There's no time to get burnt out. We need to speak up and fight for equal rights. I'm ready for a change! #vote #womensrights #equality #metoo

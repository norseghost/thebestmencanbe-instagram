Self advocacy is the ability to speak up for things you need and for things you believe in. Self advocacy can be something practiced everywhere you go, where you reside, and where you work. For example, self advocacy can look like encouraging your household to eat less meat or no meat if you personally do not support the meat industry. Self advocacy empowers you to create a life that best benefits you and your wellbeing. To begin to advocate for yourself, you need to know what you need, how you feel, desires to improve your life, and wants to change things around them. A self advocate is in tune with their feelings and has granted themselves authority over their autonomy, leading them to share what they need and potentially how to get it with others.⠀

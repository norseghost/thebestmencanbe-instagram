Today is the day! Get Out there and vote if you haven’t done so already. Vote for equal rights. Vote for human rights. Vote for the health of our planet. Vote for a woman’s right to her body and a woman’s right to live! Yes you read that right, it’s a question of life and death for women to have the right to legal abortions. 💜💙💚💛🧡❤️ #feminists #feministisktinitiativ #metoo #timesup #euelections2019 #voted #vote

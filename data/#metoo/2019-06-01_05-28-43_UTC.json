                        "text": "\u2022 B R E A T H E \u2022\nSo much has happened since this little beauty was born. Our last little poppet and our family was complete. However there has been so much going on in our life ever since James and I met, it\u2019s been like we\u2019ve been continually fighting fires. Now we are in our forever home (unless we decide we want to move again instead of extend) and all has been settled, life has had time to catch up with me.\nI won\u2019t go into details on here but I suffered so many types of abuse all through my life and I have always said I won\u2019t go digging for issues. Life has always had enough going on. Now things have had time to stand still past experiences have been bubbling up from under the surface.\nMaybe, I\u2019ll write a blog post at some point but I\u2019m going back to counselling. Things are coming up to the surface and I\u2019ve been feeling extremely depressed, recoiling at my husband\u2019s kisses (this is absolutely NOTHING to do with him) but I\u2019m acting triggered at the moment so it\u2019s time to see a professional and see what can be done with these things that want to come up to the surface after all these years.\nI guess I\u2019m saying this on here because I\u2019m so against these things being taboo. I have multiple #metoo stories and it\u2019s time to lift the lid on the box I\u2019ve tried to store them in for so long. They\u2019re escaping whether I want them to or not so some help to process is on the cards for me.\nI always thought I lived great as a survivor but at a recent safeguarding meeting for school I realised I still wear all the scars and they affect the way I do things. I don\u2019t want them carrying into the next generation. So for this little one in my arms, for the other three, for my husband and for myself I\u2019m going to get help."

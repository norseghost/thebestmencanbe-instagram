Girls who cry "rape" when they mean "regret" and those who encourage this mentality are doing as much harm to actual rape victims as the rapist themselves .
I'm a woman, I understand some of this crappy situations ,but just because you make bad decision and then have to face unpleasant consequences doesn't mean you were raped. It's an insult to actual rape victims and harmful to society to teach that girls bear no responsibility for their own choices.
Rape involves force . It involves penetration after a girl says " no".
Being a jerk and being a rapist are not the same thing.

This is for my women that have ever thought they can’t stand men.

There are some days when I wake up in fear. I wake in a panic that another man will touch me, will strip me of my dignity. Another man will lay his unwanted hand upon my head, shoulder, or waist. Another man will mistake me for his property. He will mistake me for a vessel that was only created to fulfill his needs.

There are days when I wake up in hatred. I wake in a flood of anger against the man that did this to me, and the men that do it to so many other women. I’m angry for all of the women and men that have encountered such an experience. I hate men. I hate them all.

And then I roll over. I see the man laying next to me, whom has given me his entire soul and has protected me against my demons. I see the man that has facilitated my healing and allowed me to embrace my flaws instead of taking advantage of them. I see the man that fights for my rights just as hard as I do. I see respect and absolute devotion to us as individuals, and together in our relationship.

I remember that there are good people in the world again. I remember that punishing him does not bring me justice. It does not punish anybody but the two of us.

So, to my women that have experienced these feelings: I see you. I feel for you. I know you. I am you. You will not have these emotions forever. You will become stronger. You will still experience fear and anger, but you’re strong enough to correct it.

You are not what happened to you. You do not have to let it control your life. You are an advocate, and you have the power to move forward and aid other women in their recovery. You are no longer a victim. You are a survivor.

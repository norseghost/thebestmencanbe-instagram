The marginalization of sexual assault victims really started to become a major issue in the early 1900s. The movement started to gain traction when Rosa Parks began to speak out about the Recy Taylor case (McGuire). Because of this, “During the 1930s, the public increasingly became interested in sex crimes committed by men against women,” (Journal of Social Issues). As awareness began to grow, so did psychoanalytic theories. These theories categorized sex offenders as deviants more than criminals, so it became harder and harder for victims to get true justice. When sex offenders were found as guilty, they were sent to rehabilitation programs for mental health treatment, as opposed to actually having to serve time in jail. As Americans, we are promised fair and just trials, but for sexual assault victims, their perpetrators were already categorized in a way that would end in a skewed justice, or no sense of justice at all. Perpetrators were labeled as “sexual psychopaths,” thus categorizing sexual assault as just an act of sex, not a crime, according to the Journal of Social Issues. #metoo #metoomovement #1900s #rapeculture

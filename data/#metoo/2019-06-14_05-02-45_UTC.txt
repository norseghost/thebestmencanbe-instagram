(⚠️TW:) Let’s talk more about #ptsd and how symptoms of trauma can affect the day-to-day life. For someone who hasn’t experienced trauma, it may be hard to truly envision. While everyone shows different symptoms and responds in different ways, there are certain clusters of behaviors that may resonate with other survivors. My last list seemed to be helpful so made another. My hope is that it will help explain in some specific ways how trauma can manifest from a rape. Everything on this list can be addressed and alleviated with trauma therapy. You are not alone or weird. #ptsdawareness #trauma #traumaawareness #supportsurvivors #empowersurvivors #believesurvivors #traumainformed #sexualassault #rape #abuse #resilience #metoo #metoomanyvoices #victim #survivor #education #resource #support #cptsd #courage #mentoo #mentalhealthawareness #themoreyouknow #keepgoing #healing #sexeducation #traumahealing #ptsdrecovery #impact

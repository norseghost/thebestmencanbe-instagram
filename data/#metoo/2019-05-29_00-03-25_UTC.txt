This weekend will be the final and largest display of the The Monument Quilt on the National Mall. It is the result of nearly 6 years of crowd-sourcing the stories of sexual violence and domestic abuse survivors and their allies— it will the our country’s largest tribute to them. Thank you, Megan, for working with me and shining a bright light on this (and giving us so much air time). .

This is a chance to do more than post a virtual #metoo or #ibelieveyou —you will never forget the in person experience if you visit and honor the Quilt. It is transformative. I promise. .

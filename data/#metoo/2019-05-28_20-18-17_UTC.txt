This has been my favorite restaurant in the Changi Business Park area for quite some time. Over time their menu changed slightly. Food is still good, but service is on a downhill trend. Much of the staff now seems to be waiters and inattentive to patrons.  My last visit was a big let down. I hope they can find quality staff again.

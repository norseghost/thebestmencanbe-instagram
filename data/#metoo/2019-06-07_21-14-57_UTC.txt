Am I the fittest I have ever been? No. Am I the heaviest I have ever been? Hell no. I am however the most comfortable I have ever felt in my body. THAT was a battle I never thought I would be on the other side of...for more days then not. And your standards don't mean shit. #bodypositive #nofilter #fitness #mybodymychoice #plussize #metoo

Dear BELOVED brothers and sisters PLEASE have the COURAGE to SWIPE and bare #WITNESS to our food industry✨👁✨💝we as Americans love our pet dogs and have laws to protect them from being harmed for example not being allowed in hot car yet we turn a blind eye to farm animals 😭😤🥺there is no moral justification to pay for the abuse of COWS PIGS CHICKENS and such for a piece of steak or bacon which has been classified as harmful to human health already by the #WorldHealthOrganization the only difference between dogs and farm animals is PERCEPTION ✨👁✨perception is not REALITY and the reality is that pigs and cows also deserve protection from harm 🙏💝pigs are smarter than any dog how can we treat them like this ????? Locking them up in factoryfarms 😭😭it’s a very sad thing to see the people we care about participating in things we know are not in alignment with our HUGE HEARTS 💝💜we will not stop protesting against the malicious use of animals for we have seen enough to know we must change Transparency must be valued and we protest because we care for all of us and that’s why we must put light on darkness it’s not easy having to post and having to speak but it’s even far more painful staying SILENT treating billions of animals like shit every year does not reflect what humanKIND is what civilized is what Intelligent is what advanced is  our highest path is to show mercy on those begging for compassion animals plead for their lives visit a slaughterhouse and we will hear their voices screaming for it to stop please stop the violence against animals🥺🙏🛑😭😭😭😭 every purchase we make is an opportunity to decide the type of energy we want to fuel our world with ✨👁✨💸💸💸✨🌱✨🧬✨BLESSINGS from your highly sensitive soul siSTAR reflecting in Hawaii Posted @withrepost • @earthlove777 Rp @hatfieldpigsave Make the connection. #govegan #pig #pigs #babypig #piggie #baconlover #ilovemydog #govegan #dogsarethebest #loveme #lovedogs #catsanddogs #doggie #doggies  #puerco #blt #poorbaby #potbellypig #skinnypig #ham #burrito #babybackribs #vegano #metoo #seperation #donttakeourplanetforgranted

People ask me sometimes how do I do what I do... work with inner city youth and trauma survivors both here and in Uganda, Kenya, Nepal while also being a trauma survivor. I practice. I meditate, I practice compassion, I do Qi Gong, I offer LovingKindness to myself and others and sometimes I beat the shit out of the heavy bags and do full contact sparring. What I have seen, heard, witnessed and experienced myself or amongst my daughters, my sisters, the women of this world is not okay. Will never be okay and Anger arises. I learned a long time ago to funnel that towards Productive, Protective and Creative purposes. I only wish more of my brothers did the same. Suffering arises from suffering. Hurt people hurt others. Healed people help others #facts #womenwhofight #kickboxers #martialartists #metoo #mindbodyconnection #wisdomsword #wrathfulbuddhas #fitwomen

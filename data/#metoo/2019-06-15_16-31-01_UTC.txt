Well, HC Title IX has spoken: “...Panel determined, by a preponderance of evidence” that HE “...subjected you to prohibited harassment...as he engaged in inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature...The panel also determined, by a preponderance of evidence that…[he] also subjected you to prohibited harassment, related to consensual sexual relations between a student and an employee in which an inherent imbalance of existed...such behavior constituted prohibited sexual misconduct under the College’s policy during your time at the college.” “...Responding Party [him] did not elect to participate in the investigation or the resolution process, he was not interviewed and he did not review or respond to the Investigative Report.” Sanctions

College reserved right to termination even though he resigned. Employment record will reflect “that he was terminated for cause by the College for multiple violations of the Policy.” And the same will be reflected if anyone calls and asks for info. “The College will make permanent the criminal no-trespass order against the responding party that’s been in place since September.” Can’t be on property or any owned or leased by the College, or to “an event sponsored by the College.” No contact order with current employees or current or former HC students.

College awards and honors revoked and he will be ineligible for any future ones.

College will issue a statement to the community reflecting he was “found responsible for multiple violations of College policies on sexual harassment and describing penalties…” Our part still to be figured out.

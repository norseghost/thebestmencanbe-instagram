What are we teaching our men/boys about sex?! Why do our men/boys brag about sexual encounters that were forced on them at the young age?! Why do we shame them for not wanting to have sex?! Men sexual victims have very hard time coming forward and talking about their stories because as men, they are taught to be happy about all sort of sex (forced or not). Forced sex toward men or women are considered rape! Letâ€™s teach them to recognize abuse and talk about it without shaming them. #MeTooEthiopia #metoo #metoomovement #metooafrica #metooethiopia #survivor #ethiopian #ethiopia #women #men #change #breakthesilence #yourenotalone

hey loves! so like i said on my last post ima talk about my experiences with sexuality. in 6th grade, i realized i was bisexual. two years later, I realized i was pansexual. then i had a boyfriend who didn’t know what the word no meant, went through really bad PTSD & I realized i was lesbian. so many changes in such a little time, it didn’t feel right. recently i came to the realization that i don’t need to label myself. for so long i felt the need to put a label on myself when in reality i don’t. i now go by “no label” & it feels amazing. if you feel like you need a label, you don’t. if you want to label yourself as something then go for it!! I’m not saying you shouldn’t but if you feel like you don’t want to then don’t, do whatever makes you happy!  just remember there’s nothing wrong with you, there’s a lot wrong with the world we live in! i love you all so much💗💗💗 [a lot of people don’t understand me and the whole no label thing so if you have a hard time understanding, please just keep your opinions/comments to yourself] #nolabel #sexuality #mystory #metoo #youarenotalone #iloveyou #hopetoinspire

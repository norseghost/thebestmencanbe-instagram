The CHI Actor- Jason Mitchell has learned 3 lessons “ the hard way...” First, keep your hands to yo self. Second, No means You! And Finally- 2nd chances don’t excuse bad behavior!!! As a Black man Whose Star ⭐️ was rising with television 📺 and movie 🎥 roles - both of which he received critical acclaim- he sure blew it!!! Please allow his misfortune to advise other young black men... your talent is valuable- but your reputation is priceless!!! #jasonmitchell #thechi #fired #timesup #redemption #prayforhimtoo #wirkrelated #metoo #timesup

The last week being a part of the American Medical Association annual meeting has been so empowering and inspiring ✨
*
I was on the authorship team of two resolutions that (mostly) passed through the medical student assembly.
*
We celebrated the 100th anniversary of the first woman to hold a delegate position in the House of Delegates and inaugurated the AMA’s first ever African American female president!
*
Members of the “ever conservative” AMA had a civil, logical and action oriented conversation about gun violence as a public health issue and passed policy to decrease gun violence in the form of firearm safety features.
*
We voted to pass policy recognizing that health care, in all its dimensions, is a basic human right.
*
We passed policy to study aligning the AMA with Times Up’s Health care that came from the #metoo movement to eliminate harassment and discrimination is medicine.
*
The medical student section brought forward policy that asked our AMA to remove our stance against a single payer health care system, which would allow open conversations with Washington about ALL possible options to fix our system. We had overwhelming support from multiple states and specialty societies that helped us push for this important issue, and although it did not pass, there was an hour long debate and the House of Delegates voted 47/53 against it. That is almost 50/50!!!
*
These conversations and votes weren’t happening to this extent even 3 years ago when I became a member of this organization. This week proved to me that being an advocate for things you believe in and letting your voice be heard matters! Times are changing and I am so proud and excited to be part of it! It may be happening slowly, but it is happening!

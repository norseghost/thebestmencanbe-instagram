This 3 day weekend, which I’m still not used to having holidays off, I am reading this every morning to keep me moving then play after. Lazy never got anyone to their goals and “it’s too hard” never kept me from becoming a warrior. I have beat many many things beyond what many know. I am an open book but somethings are hidden chapters. I want you to read this and know you are not alone and only you can stand in your way! #choosehope #warrior #empower #metoo #entrapenuer #persistence  #goals

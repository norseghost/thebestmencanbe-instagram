Every state has different language, but yes, even without a weapon you could have been sexually assaulted. In many states, the language is different for different charges. Some charges may read “sexual contact without consent” and more severe charges may read “sexual contact without consent AND with use of force.” The term “use of force” does not mean a weapon had to be involved. People can be physically forceful or threatening without a weapon.

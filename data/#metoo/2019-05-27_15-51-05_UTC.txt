If we are to fight discrimination and injustice against women we must start from the home for if a woman cannot be safe in her own house then she cannot be expected to feel safe anywhere.

The more that we choose not to talk about domestic violence, the more we shy away from the issue, the more we lose.
No woman has to be a victim of physical abuse. Women have to feel like they are not alone.

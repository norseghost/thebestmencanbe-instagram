First of all it was begun by a black woman @taranajaneen + was co-opted by white women which then drowned out so many marginalized voices in the fight. \n____\nBut had that wave not risen, I\u2019m not sure I ever would have. I owe this to the bravery of @taranajaneen + it continues to lend truth to the power of womxn\u2019s stories. We free each other every time we speak up. \n_____\n\nI remember the night I was alone in a garage apartment with my newborn baby sleeping next to me. It was that godawful hour of 3 am + I was wide eyed staring at the ceiling. I couldn\u2019t live another moment with what he had done to me, inside of me. I couldn\u2019t do that to my daughter. What he had done felt like a weight tied to my ankle that kept me at the bottom of the ocean. I hadn\u2019t breathed for 15 years. My protection of him had festered as my shame, a heavy black cloak I wore in the world.  I needed to hand the shame back to him to live. I remember thinking if anyone did what he did to my daughter I would eat him alive. \n___\n\nI didn\u2019t know I was accessing my Core Maiden Wounds: that moment changed the course of my life. In one night I went from hopeful + possible to terrified + worthless. My core wounds resonate with so many womxn\u2019s: that night left me feeling unsafe, abandoned, not believed, + bad. \nThat was the night I became helpless + hysterical. \n____\n\nWhen I spoke about it, it was an exorcism. I had to get rid of the demon inside of me. Crucial people from that time wished I could have kept quiet. I had been quiet for 15 years couldn\u2019t I continue to die quietly + slowly? That was painful. The pushback was painful. For a while there I was a little Maiden again, abandoned in the wind. Crying out for Mama. \n____\n\nCouldn\u2019t I just stay quiet? Not with a daughter. She didn\u2019t give me a choice. She would watch my every move. I had no choice but to learn to self advocate. I had no choice but to become a warrior. I had no choice but to pick up my sword. Now when I self advocate, I do it for my daughter + my inner Maiden, who is slowly realizing life is safe again + I believe her + I will always fight for her."

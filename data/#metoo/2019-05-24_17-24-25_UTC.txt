When is close too close? “Our virtual realty platform mimics conversations with the opposite sex, tracking eye and bodily movement and encouraging employees to answer correctly, the company's founder and president Bill West told Indiana Public Media.
West said the platform can help employees "understand that it's not just what you're saying to the person, but maybe where you're looking, how you're acting, how close you got to them where they might feel violated”. #metoo #wallstreet  #virtualreality can change us for the better.

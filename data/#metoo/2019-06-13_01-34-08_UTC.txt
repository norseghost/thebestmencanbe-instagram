Benefits of CBD oil and balms. Everyone has anxiety from time to time, but chronic anxiety can interfere with your quality of life. While perhaps most recognized for behavioral changes, anxiety can also have serious consequences on your physical health.

Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-intoxicating cannabis compound that does not cause a psychoactive “high.” Instead, this friendly molecule eases anxiety, stress, depression, and pain without the sometimes undesirable side effects of THC.

While high doses of THC can sometimes trigger anxiety, CBD has the opposite effect. This compound not only reduces some of the inebriating qualities of THC but also promotes a deep sense of calmness and ease for many people.

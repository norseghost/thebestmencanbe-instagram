I can remember attending a presentation at school when I was a teenager on sexual violence. It included things like, don’t wear revealing clothing, don’t walk alone, don’t drink too much, etc. The resounding message- that avoiding sexual assault was all my problem, my responsibility; men have wild desires, and it is up to us (women) to not provoke, or arouse them.
.
It is now 2019- I am sitting in my University class, listening to another presentation on sexual violence. Tears of relief begin to stream down my face as I listen, because this time my humanity is being recognized and not ignored. This time it doesn’t matter what clothes are worn. This time it doesn’t matter if you were walking alone. This time it doesn’t matter how many drinks you’ve had. Consent is consent. “Are they drunk? That’s a no!”, “Are they unconscious? That’s a no!”, “Did they say yes? ‘Well they didn’t tell me to stop.’ Doesn’t matter, that’s a no!”. “If it is not a VERBAL ENTHUSIASTIC YES, it is a NO.”

It is because of WOMEN, standing up and demanding equality, demanding equity, that we have started to see changes such as this take place. And it’s about damn time! Thank you. #internationalwomensday

(1) to show the world the faces of feminist founders;
(2) to create local, supportive, in-person communities of feminist founders; and (3) to encourage the world to use their purchasing power to make the world a better place. ðŸ’œ #livingwage #feminism #womensupportingwomen #strongertogether #FeministFounders

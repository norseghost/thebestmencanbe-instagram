Never say a boy/man can't get raped. There are so many little boys out here being sexually abused but they are afraid to talk because of how the system is setup. In many countries they donâ€™t have good counseling to help them mentally and their rapist use that against their rape victims as boys knowing that they would be afraid to talk or no one would believe them help us to be a voice and say no to rape

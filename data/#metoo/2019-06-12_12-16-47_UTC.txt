Last night, we held an event in Church House, Westminster, for the unveiling of a statue honouring all victims of sexual violence, including the Lai Dai Han.

We were joined by Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Nadia Murad, who unveiled the 'Mother and Child' sculpture, after saying, "We should not forget what happened to them decades of years ago, it is still happening today". Today, some of the Vietnamese victims visited the sculptures new temporary home at 10 Hanover Street, London.

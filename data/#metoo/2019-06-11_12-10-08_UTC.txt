TRAUMATIC STRESS: two things (trauma + stress) we hear so much about lately. Because empowerment, because research, because safe spaces. And now we have our voices.

It's not easy to speak about distressing or disturbing events in one's life. And it's not comfortable to share personally with a crowd.

In April, Brown Girl Mag @browngirlmag in partnership with @Sakhinyc and @karunachani hosted an incredible event for the second time. Love, Heart, and Strength poured from every panelist while addressing their experience with the #MeToo movement. I'd never experienced South Asians Break the Silence and I was astounded, moved, and proud of these fighters.

I closed the event with an energy releasing and awareness practice to over 100 people in support of the panel. And I continually am reminded that we are not survivors in solitude. We stand together.

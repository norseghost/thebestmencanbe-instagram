There’s a mindset of people “How I am supposed to react” because I had bad childhood days I was sexually abused and I shared my story. .
.
I am supposed be very simple I can’t have a boyfriend, I shouldn’t wear short clothes, I shouldn’t be stylish. And if I don’t follow above then I am a slut. .
This is why I wanted to share my story that girl it’s not your mistake. You don’t have to be certain way or punish yourself for it. It’s not your fault. I still cry when I share my story but that doesn’t mean that I weak or doing to grab attention. Because it haunts me still! .
Also I have a public profile that doesn’t mean public can control me! I will never consider those useless suggestions, and I am not answerable to anyone and ladies you shouldn’t be answerable to anyone. When women shared their #metoo story it’s not to grab attention but to share their pain which they holded for long. Which helps them to feel lighter. So next time don’t question anyone disgracefully because you don’t know their story.
If you can support it’s good but if you can’t better keep yourself shut.

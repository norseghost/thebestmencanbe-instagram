BELIEVE HER
Even if it was 'booty call hours'
Even if you think her skirt was too short
Outfit too revealing 
BELIEVE HER
Even if she's ratchet
Even if she's flirty
Heels too high for your conservative liking 
Even if she's one of those 'fass lil girls'
Even if she's accusing your favorite athlete or movie star
Even if you don't think she 'pretty enough to rape'
BELIEVE HER
Even if she's on Instagram leaving little to the imagination 
Even if you 'heard how she gets down'
START 
BELIEVING 
OUR WOMEN 
IN THE BEGINNING 
Because we haven't been 
You SHOULD be disgusted with R. Kelly 
Especially since patriarchal attitudes make you complicit
Leave it chance and rappers who admit 'I didn't believe them because they were black girls'
Archaic attitudes that make you think raoe and sexual assault are about sex is how Weinstein's casting couch and behavior stayed  known and unreported 'Well she knew what was up' is how the cloud of suspicion and shame rained qualuudes down into drinks from amerikkka's favorite dad
BELIEVE HER
We haven't been
Rape and sexual assault ate the result of mitigating circumstances 
It is the act of a bully 
A coward 
Drunk on power and misogynistic Male entitlement and privilege 
Ask yourself if your phone rings at 3:37am and your daughter is crying 
Will you ask her what she was wearing?
What she was doing at his house that late?
If she's only trying to get a check?
Ask yourself if your daughter confesses to you
Will you ask her why she waited so long?
If she's just trying to tarnish a pudding pop bullet proof image?
Or will you simply
BELIEVE HER

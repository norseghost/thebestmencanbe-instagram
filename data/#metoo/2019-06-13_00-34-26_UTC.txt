An old buddy I met in an improv class in Florida is also a podcast producer and would like to produce my show. Isn’t that something? (We also have the most amazing mutual friends...and Joe and I have worked together before, so I am really excited for this collaboration.) So, I want to ask you all what you would like to know about rape. If a rape survivor could tell you anything, what would you ask? Do you feel uncomfortable when you find out a woman is a rape survivor, and if so, what kinds of feelings, insecurities, and questions are running through your mind? I am brainstorming exactly what the show will be about and I’d love to hear from you. Send me a DM and I will see how I can incorporate it into an episode. I look forward to seeing your questions! #podcast #metoo #rapeculture #sexualassaultsurvivor

Think about it.

Just because you use someone in a certain way it says nothing about who they actually are.

Just because you decide to treat someone in a certain way says nothing about them. It only speaks of the way you choose to treat others.

Think about it.

Do you want to be ruled by the way others act.

Or do you want to be ruled by your own standards.

Always treat others with love. Let them work their own shit out.

You worry about working yours out. 
What's something that you could be focusing more on in your own life?

Dr. Martens Pride boots! They are a Journey's exclusive 1460 boot design and come with black laces. $49.99 with free shipping I ordered them Friday evening got them today. 1460's are typically at least $100. So happy that I got a Pride shoe I can wear year round and is understated.  I am not ashamed of being gay but I am also not super flamboyant so this fits my style perfectly.

Today marks one year since the attack, rape and murder of Eurydice Dixon. One year since a woman was murdered for feeling like she had the right walk home at night, and year since the media, police and everyone told us it was her fault for walking alone. 
I wish Eurydice could know how much support and love she has around Australia, I wish she could know that her death sparked an outrage from women all over Australia. I wish she knew how much her death made women across Australia demand to have our concerns for safety heard, and to change the way that media and the police address the public and to be held accountable for the language they use and the message they send when reporting on innocent women, who have done nothing, but exercise their rights as human beings. .

We formed Dangerous Females this time last year because we were angry with reports telling us it was DANGEROUS to walk home, it was DANGEROUS to wear what we want, and it was DANGEROUS to be a woman in 2019. 
We were so angry with them telling us whats DANGEROUS and that WE need to change OUR behaviour instead of looking at why there a men in this world who think itâ€™s ok to do whatever they want to women. 
That toxic masculinity is KILLING US. 
That the justice system is struggling.
That the department of mental health is struggling. 
That society is struggling. 
Eurydice Dixon, the woman who changed it all. .

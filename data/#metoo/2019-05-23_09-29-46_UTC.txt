If you’re not familiar with Shannon’s work, you probably actually are, but didn’t realise. Maybe her most recognised piece of craftivism is the notorious ‘Boys will be ... held accountable for their fucking actions’ embroidery which caught fire amid #metoo and, as Vogue said was ‘the internet’s response to Harvey Weinstein’. That particular piece was open source for the greater good, to be embroidered on flags, banners, placards, clothing - you name it - as long as the protest was being heard. It continues to burn now, but for reasons both good and bad, having been hijacked/ripped off by many (most notably @lasulaboutique’s pair of jeans which had the design stitched wholesale on the arse pocket - just like Shannon’s original idea, but for profit rather than change - see @stopiptheft for how rife this new plagiarism has become in the Instagram age). Anyway, back to my main point. Shannon’s ace. She’s important. She makes things happen. And she’s given a great and inspirational Q&A 🙏

Happy Monday, CivMixers! Hopefully, you’re getting back into the work week groove after an amazing weekend that brought so many things to go and see and experience – all while Mother Nature graced us with some of the most glorious late spring weather upstate New York has to offer. 
It was one of those halcyon weekends, the kind when everything seems just a little…better, somehow. The sun a little warmer. The pool or lake a little cooler. The ice cream a little sweeter. Friends and family and heck, even strangers, a little closer, a little nicer. It was one of those weekends that makes you wish summer wasn’t so damn fleeting here in the Capital Region. 
But maybe if that was the case, we wouldn’t love it so much. Maybe if we didn’t know dreary sleet-filled days and sub-zero nights, we wouldn’t be able to appreciate their polar opposites quite so much. 
Lots of good stuff to check out on the site at CivMix.com today. See Talia Cass’s piece on how the #MeToo movement is being experienced, and addressed, at the local level. Get a delicious porch cocktail recipe from Ginnie Farrell, courtesy of her friend, Dan. Experience the Pride Parade through Silvia Lilly’s eyes – and lens – as she captured so many memorable moments from her first ever Pride experience. 
Go. Enjoy. Savor. Leave a comment, or two. 
CivMix, it’s where it’s at.

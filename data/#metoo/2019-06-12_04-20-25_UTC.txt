4 years can make a huge difference. Back then I was scared. I couldn't look anyone in the eye. I was terrified of people. I was sick. I couldn't eat. I worked out constantly. I had to be strong in case I needed to fight. Fearful was an understatement. I carried a knife 24/7. I was so afraid of being hurt, again. Paranoid. 
Fast forward 4 years. I realize most people are ok. I can and will protect myself and my kids when I feel the need. I will look people in the eye and hold it. Not everyone is out to get me. Most people are happy to help me succeed and will support me. I can hold friendly conversation with anyone. I trust my intuition. I know real from fake. I know bad from the good.

I've been to hell and back and I'm just grateful to still be here. I still don't share my story of what happened to me 5 years ago. I hope one day I can. For now it's my cross to bear. My kids are my heroes. They're the reason I'm still here. 
Anything is possible. Just keep holding on. Choose to SH;NE above all else. Keep going. It gets better. I promise. I fucking promise.

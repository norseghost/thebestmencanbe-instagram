I am privileged to have helped many brave people speak out, stop abuse and get help to start the healing process. Never assume that today is always about positivity, warmth and love. For most it is, but for others they will be reminded of people and times theyâ€™d rather forget. .
If you need to talk, there are people out there who will believe you and listen......... donâ€™t be alone, be brave and speak up, whatever your ageðŸ™‚

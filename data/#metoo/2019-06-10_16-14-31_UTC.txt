I was 21 when my assaulter told me I would be nothing if I didn't allow him to f*ck me. He assaulted me anyways. He's now in prison modeling prison sweats and I'm in a killer movie about to be released. Fun fact: I hung out with Marla Maples the day this photo was taken at convicted Rapey McKid Toucher's fashion show I walked. We drank wine together and laughed a lot. #metoo

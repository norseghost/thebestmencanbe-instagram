I am a woman who cherishes my second amendment rights - I am not #metoo...I am #notme and #neveragain. I do not own a firearm to take life. I own it to DEFEND life!

Gun Rights are Women's Rights!

I encourage every woman who believes in her fundamental right of self protection to copy and paste and share your photo!

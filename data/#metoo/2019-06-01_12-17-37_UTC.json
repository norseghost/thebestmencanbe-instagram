                        "text": "I met my hero @taranajaneen on Friday. And when I introduced myself and mentioned we had a brief exchange on Instagram she looked at me and said, \"Oh! You are the lifting lady! You are in our database now and I tell people about you as an example of nontraditional ways to do this work!\" I am still working to be able to capture what that felt like! My hero holds me up as an example?!\n.\nWhen I first learned Tarana Burke's story back in 2017 I was profoundly moved. She figured out how to create connections between victims of sexual violence who may not have otherwise felt safe to connect. Connectedness is fundamental to healing trauma. Just two words:  #metoo . When she spoke on Friday she shared that the phrase \"me too\" came from her own struggle to tell her own story. If you have been following me here for a bit, you know that I believe those two words are plenty of story. She is also my hero because:\n\ud83d\udc9c  after she educated herself on different healing.  practices she wove them into programs that resonated with the folks whom she works with because she felt compelled to share these newfound resources. \ud83d\udc9c  she publicly recognizes that healing is not a destination nor is it all rainbows and sunshine - it is hard and messy and downright ugly at times. \ud83d\udc9c  In her own words, she \"operates from a place of service\" not \"a place of conflict.\"\n.\nI also want to thank Licia Sky @skypeacesong for bringing Tarana Burke to the trauma conference and hosting the fireside chat. It was the most wonderful way to close out my trip to the International Trauma Conference."

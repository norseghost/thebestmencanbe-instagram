Nightmares ðŸŒ“ and sleeping ðŸ’¤ problems.

Tension can build up when we feel stressed or low. Muscle relaxation can help us release this tension and allow our bodies to relax. Lie down in a comfortable position. Work from the top to bottom of your body tensing groups of muscles at a time. Relax your muscles for a similar amount of time as you tense them. Keep your breathing at a comfortable pace throughout.

If you wake up from a nightmare, try to imagine a different ending to the nightmare. Take control of the nightmare in your head. The nightmare was not real, it was a memory or creation in your brain. Counteract how the nightmare made you feel by taking control back: imagine a happy ending to the nightmare. You are in control.

If you suffer from nightmares, write yourself a caring note to put by the place you sleep. If you wake up in the night, try to remember to read the note to yourself. Even writing, â€˜I am not there. I am safe. Everything is ok.â€™ can help.

It's #memoirmonday! My new post is up on my blog about the days of my disastrous career as a lawyer and why I left many years ago, taking my Harvard College and Harvard Law degrees with me. Read at your own risk at https://diaryofmydisastrouslawcareer.blogspot.com/2019/06/sweet-home-chicago-was-my-job-killing-me.html or link in bio. 
Happy part in this installment: Harvard College reunion! Unhappy part: practically everything else, including health crises and the mishandling thereof! 
Plus, as always: fun vintage photos. Here is a photo I took of beloved Quincy House, the Harvard undergrad housing where I lived as a college sophomore, junior, and senior.

[Transforming Trauma] Overcoming Shame.  https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/beyond-surviving-with-rachel-grant/id876092316?mt=2

In this month's segment of Transforming Trauma, I speak with Executive Director of @takingbackourselves , Mikele Rauch, who shares about her work beginning in the 80's and how survivors overcome shame and flourish in community when they reconnect to their whole selves, joy, and hope in the presence of safety.

We provide therapeutic paddles for survivors of trauma and we’ve learned that after a storm, the fresh water sits on top of the bay and the salt water sinks below...
-
This creates a smooth surface that beautifully reflects everything above...
-
It is often after the darkest and hardest times in life that we see our incredible resilience reflected back to us...
-
That’s why we’re here, to take our strong survivors who have just championed above very difficult times, and to experience with them a moment of the absolute beauty of the bay in celebration of the ability to weather the storm...
-
This is one of our global adventurers from France, here in Miami supporting our mission...
-
Thanks to her and her fellow paddlers, we can support more women...
-
Come paddle with us, it just might change someone’s life...

I have never felt better than I do today. The life I have lived has taught me so many lessons. I am still growing, learning, and discovering myself. However I no longer fear this journey. I have embraced the good, bad and ugly of it all. My mental health is my priority. It has to be my priority. I deserve a fair chance at life. No one can tell me who I am and how to live. 
I am imperfect. I am a goddess. I am human. I am free. I love me. #goddess #lifequotes #life #lifestyle #lifestyleblogger #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #dmv #maryland #humanity #free #thoughts #journey #healthylifestyle #healthylife #smile #survivor #notavictim #nevergiveup #neveragain #iam #me #metoo #love #loveyourself #imperfections #inspirationalquotes #inspiration

To any of my friends and loved ones. I truly care about your mental health and well-being. I want to say it's okay and I am here for you if you ever need to talk.

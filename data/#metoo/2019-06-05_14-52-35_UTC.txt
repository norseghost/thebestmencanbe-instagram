One of the most important parts of healing after a toxic relationship is the mindset you have going into it. Understanding that your recovery journey won’t always be easy but still embracing it. ⠀

Instead of feeling defeated look at all of the knowledge you now have in surviving that relationship and healing all of the wounds the trauma left you with. ⠀

Helping others helps us. Put purpose to your pain. Spread awareness and make a difference in someone else’s life. Nobody knows what they are going through more than you which makes your pain so very valuable. Keep that in mind next time you find yourself asking “why me?”. You survived hell for a reason. Never forget that. 💜⠀

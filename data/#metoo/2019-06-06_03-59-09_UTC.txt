Key point: At 6 weeks of pregnancy, most women won't even realize that they're pregnant.

I differ with @ocasio2018 in that I'm not concerned with the fact that men did it, I'm concerned that it was wrong. It wouldn't be right if it was mostly women who passed the bill.

To any conservative woman who is going to respond to this saying “I am a woman”, address the point @Ocasio2018 raised (re-written in the first paragraph of this caption). You being a woman doesn't automatically make you right/wrong, just as being a man doesn't make you automatically right/wrong.

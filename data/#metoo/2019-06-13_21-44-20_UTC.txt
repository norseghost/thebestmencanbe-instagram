This may seem like an unimportant photo, but it holds so much significance that I want to share with the world, as we do these days 🤷🏼‍♀️ In this photo I am studying for an exam 🎉🎉🎉 I have not had the ability for such an activity for most of my adult life due to PTSD. I was diagnosed in college during a time when life required LITTLE MORE than the ability to study. Needless to say I wasn’t successful in my pursuits. Fortunately there was dance, which did, and always has saved me. While it’s taken me over 15 years and significant medical and family support, I am alive, I am functioning as an adult most days, and I am freakin’ studying! This brain won’t re-wire itself! 🎉🎊🎉 Whoop whoop 🤜🏼 #studylife #focus #recovery #metoo #librarydwelling

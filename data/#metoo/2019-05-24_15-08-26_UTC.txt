In the last 53 days Iâ€™ve experienced:
7,500 faces in the audience
31 planes
21 stages
2,200 miles of driving
39 nights spent away from home
13 states
3 protest marches
2 candlelit vigils
-
Despite the numbers. Despite the sleepless nights. Despite the exhaustion. It was ALL worth it.
-
To come face to face with survivors, allies, and those just fighting for a better life has been a blessing that could never be measured or put into words. To walk ALONGSIDE you all has been the most humbling experience of my life. What stands out to me most?...
-
The countless tear-filled hugs
The countless powerful conversations
The countless acts of bravery Iâ€™ve witnessed
The countless passionate advocates Iâ€™ve met
...and the countless times I looked out that tiny plane window, tears streaming down my face, feeling grateful, honored, and hopeful for the future.

To everyone I met along the way on this crazy journeyâ€”I love you, I see you, I acknowledge your pain and your experiences. Remember that that pain can make you BETTER, not bitter. It can be your greatest gift, your unique power. Itâ€™s up to you to walk in it. Youâ€™re more capable than you know. I promise. Healing is for you. Redemption is for you. And Iâ€™m here FOR YOU, cheering in ALL the ways through ALL the days ðŸ’›

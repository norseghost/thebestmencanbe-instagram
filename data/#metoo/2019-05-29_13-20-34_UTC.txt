My name is Iyleen. I am a member of the Diversity Board and today I will be taking over today’s social media. I will be focusing on Asian American women in the media. When I chose this topic, I knew I couldn’t do it without highlighting my friend and role model, Connie Lim aka MILCK @milckmusic She is a singer and songwriter, originally from Los Angeles. Connie is a middle child of Chinese immigrant parents. She was an independent artist before signing with Atlantic Records. Her song, “Quiet” became the anthem song for the Women’s March and #MeToo movement. She originally attended UC Berkeley for pre-medicine before deciding to take risk and drop out of college to pursue her career in music. Her hardwork has definitely paid off. Her music is featured on TV shows such as Red Line and The Bold Type. Last year, MILCK went on the Hello Sunshine Together Live tour with Abby Wambach, Yara Shahidi, and Ibtihaj Mohammed to share stories of empowerment. MILCK hopes to utilize her music to bring attention to social justice issues.

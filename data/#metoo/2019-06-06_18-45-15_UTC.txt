Hi. 
I made this account to not only grow through the shit I went through, but also to hopefully help those who may have questions and are going through a similar experience (which I hope nobody does experience sexual assault — it’s absolutely awful).
However, rape and sexual assault continue to happen, even if statistics show that police reports show a decline of rape and sexual assault in recent years.
It’s still out there, folks. It’s very real.
I didn’t think it would happen to me, but it did.
My goal with this account is to make people more aware of the presence of sexual assault, be a listening ear for those in need, and express my own frustrations at times when society lets me down.
Be strong, be brave. ❤️

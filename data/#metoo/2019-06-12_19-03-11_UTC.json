                        "text": "According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center\n\u2022 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men will be raped at some point in their lives.\n\u2022 In the United Stares 1 in 3 women and 1 in 6 men experienced some form of contact sexual violence in their lifetime.\n\u2022 51.1% of female victims of rape reported being raped by an intimate partner and 40.8% by an acquaintance.\n\u2022 52.4% of male victims report being raped by an acquaintance and 15.1% by a stranger.\n\u2022 49.5% of multiracial women and over 45% of American Indian/Alaska Native women were subjected to some form of contact sexual violence in their lifetime.\n\u2022 91% of victims of rape and sexual assault are female, and 9% are male\n\u2022 In 8 out of 10 cases of rape, the victim knew the perpetrator.\n\u2022 8% of rapes occur while the victim is at work.\nThe problem of sexual violence runs rampant, and yet rape is the most under-reported crime; 63% of sexual assaults are not reported to police. Of the remaining 37% that are reported less than 10% are instances of false reporting. The facts are clear, and still the culture that would rather victims of sexually based crimes remain silent prevails.\nJoin Rebecca MacCeile as she throws off the shackles of silence and raises her voice. Turquoise Boot Straps: A Survivor\u2019s Thoughts provides a glimpse into her journey of self discovery while tackling many controversial topics at the height of the MeToo era.\n\nTo read more of Rebecca's thoughts on surviving and overcoming sexually based crimes you can find her latest release Turquoise Boot Straps: A Survivor's Thoughts on Amazon or by following the #linkinbio.

A Father's Nightmare
…
James had always wanted a son; someone he could teach to play football and that would love to go fishing and hunting with him. He was taken back when he found out that the baby on the way wasn’t going to be the son he had always dreamed of but in fact would be a girl. What was he going to do with a daughter? He knew nothing about raising a girl and was no longer quite as excited for his new little one’s arrival.

She was a firecracker, full of life and love for everyone that she came in contact with and he was overly protective. After her mom passed away when she was ten Lauren and James grew closer. Once she reached high school, he was navigating a space he wasn’t ready for and doing so alone.

He thought stricter rules meant less chance of something happening to her and Lauren had always done her best to abide by them.

Lauren had every intention of obeying her dad’s rules while she was away at school and she did so for the first month or so until she met Cameron. He was older and lived a short distance away in Sacramento. He showered her with praise and always had sweet little presents for her, presents that there was no way she could afford.

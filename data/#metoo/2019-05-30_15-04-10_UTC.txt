Harassment doesn't happen with just women. Men too go through victimization and often suffer in silence since it's not heard of as much. @project_sheild aims at achieving freedom from  the fear of harassment, irrespective of gender. At the same time, while learning self defense techniques, young boys and girls together understand the issue of safety and will work towards making our surroundings safer. It's imperative to inculcate these values at a young age and prevent any more people to grow up to become abusers.

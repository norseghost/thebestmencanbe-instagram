SO... It's not often I'll jump onboard a social media bandwagon however this campaign is SO very important and resonates with me deeply.

Each and everyday to some degree, I have to live with and in somewhat am reminded of the aftermath of what happened to me. Everyday in some way, shape or form I am reminded about what somebody decided to take from me, something that should always be MY decision and MY choice. 
I have always been left with feelings of guilt, questioning whether I've deserved what I've been through or if there was anymore I could have done and even now more than ten years on, I still experience slight anxiety, fear and blame.

This is just ONE encounter, with ONE person and the inevitable and horrible truth is that this is happening to hundreds and thousands of women AND men each and every week leaving people feeling powerless, without a sense of control and like they don't have a choice in what does or does not happen to their body!

I'm so proud of the woman I am today and the fact I've managed to turn my life around, I'm now no longer a victim but a survivor and I will stand up for and support movements like this to help raise awareness and make a difference in even one persons life!

Happy Saturday FAM! ðŸ˜˜

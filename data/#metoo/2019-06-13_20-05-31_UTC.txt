ðŸŒŸSWIPE FOR FULL ILLUSTRATION & INFOðŸŒŸ the lovely Gemma and Maya over at @ourstreetsnow are teaming up with Farah from @catcallsofldn and organising a peaceful protest at Parliament Sq on 20.6.19 at 5:30-8:30pm as a call to Parliament to address legislation surrounding street harassment! Iâ€™ve been helping them where I can and myself as well as the lovely ladies would LOVE if you could get yourselves down there and start some conversation! We need all the support we can get to ensure Parliament get talking and making some changeðŸ’ª .

This is a submission from Elizabeth, who provided the following context behind these quotes from a “narcissistic, proud, haughty” vegan rapist. (Swipe for the second quote) Heavy trigger warning for sexual violence and graphic description of bodily injury: 
Here’s the quote from the vegan rapist after he held down my arms and fucked me so violently that I started to bleed. (I was on cycle day 8 and my period was over 3 full days before he raped me. I bled from the trauma to my cervix.)

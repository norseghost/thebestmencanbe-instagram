TBT!! Take me back to England’s country side. Yes, I took this photo. 😍 I am not a good photographer but this picture is one of my best. Leed’s castle was amazing and the gardens were breath taking. One of my goals when we went to Europe was to go see a real mid evil castle. This one did not disappoint. Have you ever been to England? If so, where? Can’t wait to go back. .

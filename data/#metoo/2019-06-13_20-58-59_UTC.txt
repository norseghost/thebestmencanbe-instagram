"Cry Me a River" 16×20" was created with a thought.. a thought that weighed on my heart and soul. The simple twisted thought that my pain, my hardships and my voice were unworthy of anyone's love and compassion. It started with my  #metoo tragedies, merged into the important #mmiwhoismissing not getting nearly enough attention, and flowed into the ugly truth that this piece represents ALL WOMEN. We are told that maybe pain is just part of our lives forever, maybe it's something hormonal, maybe mental.. or emotional.. OR maybe it's fucking real and we still manage to boss TF up everyday without the validation

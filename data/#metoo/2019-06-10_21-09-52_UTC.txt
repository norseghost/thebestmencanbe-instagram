Not sure if its just me but I managed to fix my ig after stories kept getting deleted from my #faithjourney & #metoo highlights. So in 4 days  yesterday I've blocked about 125 fake ig accounts and know its fake as the same photos or links on the bios keep reappearing. 
It's annoying as it takes courage to share these things that society silences us on or are still awkward and tabboo out but then I realised no matter how good you are as a person or what good work you do people will always try bring it down. 
But really  @opendoorsnewzealand shared the top 20-50 dangerous countries to follow Jesus as christians are the most persecuted group of people on the planet yet the  mainstream media fails to publicise that and how blessed & privileged we are in NZ  to fellowship with others without fear of our safety.

At my new job with the police when we are on nightshift and leave the hq we are given keys with alarms so incase someone tries to harm us or runs at us we press the button and the whole organisation is alerted. 
It makes me sad that people like me are getting killed for their beliefs but just makes me want to share my story even more.  I used to be an atheist so I understand why people wouldnt believe but I never shamed others for their beliefs in Jesus so why should anyone else?? I know its really hard when at uni there are some people who class all  christians with their negative preconceptions where some  call us "stupid", "culty", or "idiots" because a few do really stupid things that make me cringe. It is hard being a christian in this day & age but remember that you deserve to believe what you believe and dont let anyone take that away from you.

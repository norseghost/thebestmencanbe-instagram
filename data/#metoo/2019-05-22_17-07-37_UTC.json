By combining the tales tinfoil-hatters have told over time, these truthers have packaged everything attractive about this type of propaganda in one tantalizing product. And that means more and more people will buy what they\u2019re selling.\n\nThen there\u2019s QAnon\u2019s path to prominence \u2014 from 4chan to 8chan to more mainstream sites such as YouTube and Twitter and, finally, to a Florida Trump rally and television screens across the nation. In the cesspools where the theory first flourished, registration is either not required or not possible, and the \u201crules,\u201d such as they are, look nothing like the terms of service for a site like Facebook. The intelligentsia is already at odds over how the more-established entities should regulate themselves, or be regulated. It\u2019s even harder to have that conversation about a site like 4chan or 8chan that eschews responsibility for its content entirely.\n\nNow that it\u2019s clear that what starts on the fringe doesn\u2019t stay there, it is a real concern. QAnon\u2019s lurch from online to off hasn\u2019t manifested only in T-shirted ralliers wielding weird signs. Last week, a \u201cbaker\u201d appeared outside Michael Avenatti\u2019s office because Q sent him there. Others have started searching for child sex camps in the desert outside Tucson. A man in an armored truck blocked a bridge near the Hoover Dam demanding the release of a report that Q claimed the government was withholding. He had two guns.\n\nMolly Roberts\nThe Washington Post\n\n#marketing #trending #profit #political #success #collective #ootd #politics #trending #metoo #timesup #trend #strategy #feminism #finnishgirl #freedom #graphics #future #lifestyle #journalist #journalism #psychology #god #fashion #trendy #hygge #blogger #influencer #business #lgbt #concept"

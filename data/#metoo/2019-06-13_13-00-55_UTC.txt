It’s so difficult for me to listen to men who honestly believe women shouldn’t have the right to control their own bodies, men who literally talk as if women’s sole purpose is having babies, men who act as though women should be punished for having sex by forcing her to have a baby. With abortion laws, it’s hard to respect someone’s opinion when their opinion supports the loss of a human right for women.

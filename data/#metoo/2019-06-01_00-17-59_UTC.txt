Jigsaw - Thought you might like to see how a necklace comes together.  First There are my D-Michele polymer clay beads, Sterling silver, red rubber, imitation sinew and of course my Lindstrom tools (in this case flush cutters, needle point pliers, and an awl) I decide on the patternless it out attach the clay beads, add the sterling silver, and the rubber. Now While this looks easy and fast it took me two days to get the pattern right and the colors right and to put it together. Hope you like it. $350 artjewellery #artjewelry #dramatic #joyascontemporaneas #sculpturaljewelry #contemporaryart #contemporaryjewelry #contemporaryjewellery #statementnecklace #statementjewelry #statementjewellery #handmadejewelry #artistsoninstagram #artofinstagram #wearableart #statementpiece #advancedstyle #40plusfashion #women #empoweringwomen #businesswoman #metoo #womeninbusiness #necklace #polymerclay #womenoftheworld #international

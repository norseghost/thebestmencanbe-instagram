When seeking justice against my perpetrator, people would often say, "you're so brave." For the longest time I would look at them confused because I didn't "feel" brave. I had always imagined bravery to feel like a roaring lion. Like a warrior running into battle with a fierce battle cry.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

I learned that being brave doesn't always mean you feel like a roaring lion. Sometimes being brave means you are very afraid, but you still take the next step in front of you.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

We all face times of feeling afraid. Perhaps it's a presentation at work, walking away from a relationship, or taking a chance on ourself. Whatever obstacle you're facing today, don't wait to "feel" brave. Know that you are worth it, and then take the next step in front of you.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

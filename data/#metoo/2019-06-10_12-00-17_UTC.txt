Art Basel’s Unlimited section opens today and it includes Andrea Bowers’ installation ‘Open Secret’ (2018/2019). The work documents the development of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements against sexual harassment and assault. ‘Open Secret’ is composed of two long walls that gather a series of banners chronicling the name, profession, employment status, summary of allegations, apology status, and course of legal action taken against a wide array of accused individuals exposed through the rampant attention that these movements brought to the suppression of such violations. Wheeled office chairs are positioned before the walls, allowing viewers to sit and spend more time reading through the exhaustive database compiled by Andrea Bowers’ studio. As Art Unlimited curator Gianni Jetzer has commented, Bowers’ work is a “stunning artistic monument to one of the most important women’s movements globally”. @artbasel @radicalhospitality @giannijetzer #artbasel #artbasel2019 #artunlimited #andreabowers #radicalhospitality #opensecret #metoo #timesup #giannijetzer #kaufmannrepetto #milano #newyork

Trigger Warning ** This last month has been the hardest
Functioning on auto pilot and blaming myself. But I will not let it define me, he took a part of me but only a small part, he left the parts that make me glow, make me shine, he left my strength intact and he took only a fleeting, unpermitted moment, he took with him my resentment and hate, I hope now they will consume him with the same guilt that consumed me. I will not forgive him but I will forgive myself.  #metoo #trusttheprocess

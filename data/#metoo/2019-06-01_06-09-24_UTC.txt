This is courage, integrity, loyalty and fierceness.  At the grad dinner she sang "til it happens to you", she got three words out before she saw her friend and her mother and before she sang through tears the rest of the song......this was for her, this was an eff you to those "adults"who have villianized her and our family for sticking with her friend, for standing up for what society talks about, but we all know talk is cheap, and moral character even cheaper.  She understands the scales of justice, but also understands #metoo and in her short 17 years has proven time and time again to be more mature than the judgemental adults who surround her.  She is not a sheep, and over the grad week has consistently heard "find your passion/take a stand". Well she did, has and always will.  In the words of her teachers "if she sees an injustice, something she doesn't agree with or hypocrisy,  she will say eff you, you don't find that in young people." So to the adults spouting off what it means to be an adult, I hope you wake up today, and in your wisdom and advanced years (me included) grow up to be half of what this young lady is.  #effyou #tilithappenstoyou #LadyGaga

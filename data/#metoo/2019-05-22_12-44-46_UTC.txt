“Fun” has never come naturally to me. In fact, many times it seemed like a foreign language I attempted to speak just to fit in.  It’s a form of relaxation that doesn’t play well with hypervigilance or it’s sad cousin hypo-vigilance. 
As I child, I survived by never letting down my guard. Hide n’ Go Seek was not a game—I hid to be safe. 
Now for the sake of my children, I ease into play and fun via “fake it till you make it”. It still feels like work, but it’s getting easier.

For the first 25 years of my life I was looking for someone to love me hard enough to show me my value.⁣
*⁣
I thought if the right person loved me, I would have won the fight against my abuser. You see, after being told I was ugly, useless, worthless and stupid for 10 years, those words became my truth.⁣
*⁣
I had to fight hard to become the person I am today - strong, knowing my worth, feeling my value at my core, loving myself because of my flaws not despite them. And this led to me finding the love of my life - only after finding that love within first.⁣
*⁣
The catalyst to that complete change in my thinking was truly learning this: My abuse wasn't about me.⁣
*⁣
My abuser did not set out to abuse me. He was abusing. Anyone could have been there and would have suffered the same fate.⁣
*⁣
Taking ego out of the equation allowed me to eliminate the ultimate question that had been plaguing me: Why me?⁣
*⁣
So many people ask that question every day. Why me? All types of situations cause this question to pop up.⁣
*⁣
If I can eliminate that question through the understanding that my abuser wasn't trying to do anything to me, but rather was trying to do something for himself, then I can apply it to any situation.⁣
*⁣
Can you?⁣
*⁣
Tell me in the comments the last time you asked, 'Why me?'⁣

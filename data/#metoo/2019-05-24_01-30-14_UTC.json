And, I ain\u2019t talking this hippie dippy shit - although I am a yoga instructor. Namaste. .\n.\nWe look for a place where someone can see us. In case we are assaulted. .\n.\nThe predator may get a jail sentence for a couple of months, maybe years if the Judge is self aware and NOT socially aware - but the person that had to witness and absorb the assault (I will NOT say victim) - you are the S(h)ero - this is the human that has to live with the consequences. (woman or man) .\n.\nFlight or mutha fu*kin\u2019 fight. That\u2019s what happens to your brain. Nothing and no one seems safe after that. .\n.\nYou rob yourself. You rob others. Of LOVE. After that happens. Because you are protecting yourself from there on out. .\n.\nI was assaulted more recently than I would like to admit and I\u2019ve been a hermit. My house. Mom\u2019s house. Client meeting.  Nada m\u00e1s. No more. But, damn pain + anguish make your work so damn impactful. .\n.\nThe true challenge is not just over coming my fear. The true challenge is to not see others as the enemy. .\n.\nI walked after sunset for the first time in a LONG time in #dumbo to see the Brooklyn Bridge from a new perspective. By myself. I looked for the light. My stomach dropped when a man walked beside me. I refused to adopt hate or fear.  Because I refuse to add hate to the conversation. .\n.\nMy respite is this post to you. As #TeacherKing taught me on this trip - social media is a tool. To connect. To be heard. To help others overcome. .\n.\n.\n.\n#ownyourvoice #voiceofimpact #findyourvoice #metoo #brooklynbridge #BK #cnt #cognitivebehavior #overcome #ptsd #shero #hero #instaworthy #listenup #consciousleaders #speakup #makeadifference #thisisit"

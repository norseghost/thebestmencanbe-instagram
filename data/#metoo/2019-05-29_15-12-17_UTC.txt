As a writer, notepads are always a welcome gift. ðŸ˜€
.
I got this yesterday from a session organised by @techherng titled, Women and Work: Sexual Harassment, Experiences and Solutions. It was quite rewarding, not just because of the notepad, there was small chops too. Lol.
.
These conversations must go on until it is registered in our subconscious; until harassment is no longer a norm. 
If you would like to participate, email @techherng. . .

I also had the pleasure of meeting other women who are equally dedicated to the cause. Thanks @bhotchocolate for inviting me. Thanks Buky and Chioma for putting it together; and for the notepad, and small chops too. ðŸ˜€

In a mood? You need a workout to suit it! I can’t believe how much Studio LB has grown over the years and I’m so grateful that you all put your time, sweat-equity, and faith in me to help shape your bodies. With new full length workouts in The Program and shorter Quick Burns debuting each week, I’ve heard from some of the newer members to our community that the sheer size of the video library can be overwhelming.

While you know I urge you to stick to my weekly schedules for optimal results, there are also some days that you just want your workout to fit your mood. Check out my suggestions when mining through the library for those days you’re feeling some type of way > > on the blog. .

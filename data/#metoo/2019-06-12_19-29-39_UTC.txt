Tommy Tonâ€™s street style photos have played their part in fashion's awakening, alongside the rise of Instagram, the presence of female designers in top jobs, and the consciousness raising of #MeToo and Time's Up. Ton has an eye for "real women" with real style, not influencers in head-to-toe runway looks. Ton brought that sensibility with him to @deveauxnewyork, the menswear label where he took the creative director role a year and a half ago and quickly launched women's; it's now bigger than the men's offering. The brand's first Resort collection features "grounded in reality" dresses, which as Ton describes, "sounds mundane, but we find them inspiring." Tap the link in our bio to see every look.

Believing your child when they first disclose their sexual abuse to you is critical to their well-being and healing. When parents don’t believe their child, they set the stage for them to become involved in risky behaviors to numb the trauma of abuse and not being believed and supported. Failing to believe a child also  leaves them vulnerable to future abuse.
We have to take this call to action seriously! Start educating yourself on how to protect your kids. Believe them. Support them. Let’s not have regrets that could have been avoided. childsexabuseawareness #stopchildsexabuse #childsexabusesurvivor #parentsofchilldsexabusesurvivor #sexualassault #endchildsexabuse #endrapeculture #childabuse #sextrafficking #atlanta #ATL #Georgia #church #girls #teens #awareness #rapevictim #victim #children #prevention #trafficking  #survivor #tips #blogger #speaker #metoo #advocate #volunteer  #socialmedia article: @theshaderoom

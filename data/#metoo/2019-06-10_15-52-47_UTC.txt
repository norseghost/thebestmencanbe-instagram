In Japan, broken objects are often repaired with gold. The process is called Kintsugi. Instead of throwing away a broken piece or trying to hide it, they highlight it. The flaw is seen as a unique piece of the object's history, which adds to its beauty. Think about this when you feel broken.⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Our wounds in life are part of us. When we try to ignore or hide them, we are left in pieces. Let us take time to tend to our broken pieces.

With broken pieces from regretful things we did, may we make any amends we can, may we make peace with our self, and may we accept this piece of our story.⠀⠀⠀

With broken pieces from wounds caused by life or others, may we do healing things such as share with friends, journal, pray, talk with a counselor, and practice self-care. Through processing what happened and experiencing some healing, we are able to continue in life with these broken pieces. They are no longer something we try to keep hidden. We no longer see them only as markers of pain, but we also them telling the story of what we did with that pain. Reminders that we are still here, and the pain didn't destroy us forever. Reminders that we didn't let the wound have the last word. We fought for our self in the aftermath. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The mending, the streams of gold bringing all the broken parts together, tell the story of how we fought for our self, for our heart. They are beautiful symbols of the strength, perseverance, self-love, hope, and so much more we have demonstrated by embracing our broken pieces.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Finally at a point where I can actually stop and admire the smaller things around me. My head though a nightmare at night feels free and calm during the day. There are things that people can do that can leave a life long impact on their mental health. But I'm still here after all is said and done and won't let it drag me down forever. #metoo #survivor #mentalhealthawareness #happiness #flowers #blue #photography #nature #smelltheflowers #movingforward #movingon

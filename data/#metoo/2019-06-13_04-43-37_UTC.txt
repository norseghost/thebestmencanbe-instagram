All I can say is wow.....what a sexist asshole. My profile picture is on the right. I chose this picture because I felt beautiful in it. I have been insecure about my appearance most of my life. Lately, Iâ€™ve been trying to take steps to feel more confident. Am I supposed to post pictures of myself dressed in a turtle neck sweater just because Iâ€™m heavy chested? No. Itâ€™s summertime and guess what..... Iâ€™ll wear what I want. I think the douchebag was just butt hurt that I wouldnâ€™t give him my number right off the bat. I canâ€™t wait until I find a boyfriend so I can be done with these stupid apps. ðŸ˜’ #onlinedatingsucks ##idresshowiwant #metoo #womenarenotobjects #womenarepeopletoo #littledickproblems #okcupidnightmares #femaleempowerment

"Government's have made concrete commitments to survivors of sexual violence in conflict, but they are overdue on fulfilling them." - Nisha Varia, Women's Rights Division, Human Rights Watch.

Modern wars are increasingly characterised by barbaric acts of sexual violence to terrorise populations and destroy communities. 
Coming up next month, Justice for Lai Dai Han will host an event in Westminster, on Ending Sexual Violence in Conflict; this event is the second in a series on the widespread proliferation of sexual violence in conflict. Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Nadia Murad will headline this event along with VIP guests & victims of sexual violence.

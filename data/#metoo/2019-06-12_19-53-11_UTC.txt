Life has been throwing me some lemons this week! Whew! 
After 4 years, I've learned to take time to recoup after crappy days. Believe me, I learned the long hard way. Down time is necessary. So I'm taking a day to soak up some sun and play with my kiddos.  Tomorrow I'll be out for a bit of a nip tuck (I wish that meant boob job or tummy tuck). Sadly, it's not cosmetic, but hopefully, afterwards, I will have the bladder of a childless 18 year old! Hooray for not piddling when I laugh!

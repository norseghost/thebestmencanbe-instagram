I do not post this for self pitty or you to feel sorry for me it\u2019s just my journey.\n\u25fe\ufe0f\n\u2733\ufe0fFather\u2019s Day after your Dad dies looks different\u2733\ufe0f\n\u2022\n\nFather\u2019s day looks like dodging the card aisle because you just can't bring yourself to read them and the truth is you don't feel like you belong in that aisle anymore, it's for those with a Dad that lives here and not in Heaven\n\u2022\n\nIt looks like changing the channel when the commercials come on talking about gifts for Dad because you know that not even Amazon Prime can deliver a gift to Heaven\n\u2022\n\nIt looks a lot like hoping nobody will ask you what your plans are for Father\u2019s Day or what you bought your Dad\n\u2022\n\nIt looks a lot like picking up the phone and hoping that somehow today the lines in Heaven will be open and he will answer, just this once\n\u2022\n\nIt looks a lot like wishing you could buy him just one gift\n\u2022\n\nIt looks a lot like running to the phone every time it rings hoping this time it will say \u201cDad Calling\u201d\n\u2022\n\nIt looks a lot like old memories and trying to remember the last Father\u2019s Day you spent with him\n\u2022\n\nIt looks a lot like old pictures together because he won't here to take new pictures with you \u2022\n\nIt's a lot of people telling you how you should move on and just walk down the card aisle\n\u2022\n\nBut you see, Father\u2019s Day is so much more than all of that after your Dad dies\n\u2022\n\nIt's a lot like savoring every moment you can not just on the holidays but every single day in between\n\u2022\n\nIt's a lot like praying that your kids know that the cards and gifts are great but all you really want is time with them and that's all because your Dad taught you that \u2022\n\nIt's a lot like thinking of your Dad the entire day but knowing that's nothing new\n\u2022\n\nIt's a lot like hoping that you've turned out to be every bit like him\n\u2022\n\nIt's a lot like praying he\u2019s up there in Heaven knowing that this Father's Day will be like all the others since he left\n\u2022\n\nIt will be a day(continued in comments)"

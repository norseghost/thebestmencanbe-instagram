Woody Allen will start shooting for his new movie in Spain at the beginning of July. The untitled film will be a comedy-romance about an American married couple going to the San Sebastian film festival. The cast will include Christoph Waltz, Elena Anaya, and Louis Garrel, says Mediapro Studios, which will produce the film alongside Gravier Productions. Allen’s latest film “A Rainy Day in New York” was shelved by Amazon after allegation of sexual misconduct made by his daughter Dylan Farrow started to resurface with the “Me Too” movement. The movie is set to be released in Europe in late 2019. .

You know I hate to use my business page as an activist page, but I need you to be aware. I've been informing people about food and health issues arising from the poisoning from this company for over a decade.
Flip through the pictures following this one to see just what Monsanto does to human beings.
They are the epitome of everything that is wrong.
Monsanto is the same company that made Agent Orange in Vietnam which was used to spray the people in Vietnam. It is still causing birth defects four Generations later.
Coming from a family with a heavy background in government employment for war, please don't ever ask me why I don't don't enjoy War.
Monsanto has a history of poisoning people. This is who has a monopoly on the seeds in the United States and also who genetically modified your food, and owns Roundup which is the toxic mix that is sprayed on our food.
It is our civil duty to inform as many people about this because there still are so many that don't know. And then there are some they don't realize the consequences of not changing the way they live. It really is a choice of choosing whether you're going to die in your sleep, or if you're going to die in a hospital before your time hooked up to a bunch of machines.
A GMO free way of life is preventative medicine for not dying of cancer.

Most of the people/patients are complaining about diarrhea, vomiting, acute abdominal pain & stomach ulcers. OK guys Acidity, bloating & other digestive problems are very common during Ramadan Why❓bcuz of poor eating habits and prolonged fasting can cause acidity in the stomach...🙄
At the end of a long summer fast, all one can think of is a glass of Cold water... Now I'm going to share with u another simple, healthier, thirst Quencher + anti acid recipe and tips...
. 🌸Prophetic Beverage 🌸
Nabeez was one of the favorite drink of our beloved Prophet Muhammad(SAW). It is an ideal drink for Ramazan that will boost u and one of my favorite drink to quench thirst. 
Nabeez is an alkaline in nature, it helps to cure acidity of your stomach as well as improves digestive system..So let's come how to make it? 🔰Ingredients:
▪️Dates/Raisins ▪️Honey
▪️Water 
You can either use dates or raisins, but not the two ingredients together at the same time.( Refrence: Hadith)
.
🔰Direction:
1. Take 5-7 dates or a handful of raisins

2. Soak it  overnight  in a covered bowl.

3. Add honey 
4. Strain, blend(optional) and serve.

Note: Nabeez should not be soaked for longer than 12 hours, otherwise, it will start to ferment
. 🎀As I shared with you Complete Ramadan Diet plan before , I'm repeating it, drink enough fluids during sehri & iftar to keep yourself hydrated throughout the day.
🎀Don't break your fast with oily & sugary foods
🎀Chew your food well.. Koi aap k peechy 1122 nahi lagi hoe bar bar yehi samjha rahy patients ko b plz avoid overeating. Eat in a calm & relaxed manner.
🎀Do not sleep immediately after your Sehri/iftar meal.
🔰 It will help you feel less bloated.

In this Holy month of Ramadan, let’s follow another sunna of & drink Nabeez....😋

Let me know if you have  tried it... Always love hearing from you.

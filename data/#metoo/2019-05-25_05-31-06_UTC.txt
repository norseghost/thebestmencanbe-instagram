Friendship has really been on my mind lately. Being a new mom can be a lonely place sometimes, and dealing with trauma or just the struggles in life, have really made me value the few, true, life giving friends that I have. Thankful for @marcopoloapp  for making it easier to connect with them at all the crazy hours of the day.💕 👉🏽 what are your friendship tricks? ⁣

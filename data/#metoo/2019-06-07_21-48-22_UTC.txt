The Lady Vanishes, 1938. You could make a very good argument that this is one of the best and most important films ever made, and so much has been said and written about it that it seems pointless to add my two cents. But that doesn't mean I'm not going to. In part because I spent a very good period of my life working on a book called The Lady Vanishes that included an analysis of this film, and lots of analysis of Shakespeare, written by the inimitable Theresia de Vroom.

There's a lot to be considered and analyzed here about gender, especially given how progressive the film seems to be. The women are the most astute characters, and the ones concerned with the most important issues, both physically and metaphysically. The men are either evil or aloof, self-involved, and obsessed with meaningless nonsense like cricket. It also stresses the importance of women having strong female role models. You could probably write an entire dissertation about the male magician who spends the whole film using the tricks of his trade to gaslight women into believing they don't have their wits about them. An interesting film to watch in the era of #metoo and identity politics.

Regarding craft, fuck Chinatown, this is the greatest script ever (I'm being maybe a tiny bit hyperbolic, but not much). It's basically perfect, with not a single wasted moment and the immaculate arrangement of all the necessary information and characters. It's so good it's easy to forget you're watching a movie that's 80 years old. This was written decades before anyone thought about analyzing or applying easily replicable formulas to the screenwriting industry, and yet it has every hallmark of a perfect modern screenplay. As for the directing, it's Hitchcock, so need we say much? The camera work is perfect, the incorporation of comedy is genius, and the sense of propulsion in both narrative and physically because of the train, are stellar. It is a superlative example of the art of cinema.

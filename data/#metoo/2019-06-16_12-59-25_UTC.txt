"Dear god, how could I trust anyone after years of disappointment and betrayal? How could I not want to run away again and again? Escape. I will never be what society expects me to be. I've seen too much. I cannot turn back. I have been kidnapped, tortured, humiliated and abused. In the end I still have hope. I still believe in the goodness of humans. Thank god for nature. For the angels that surround me. For the spirit of my uncle who is always protecting me. From now on, I'm Mister X. And Mister X loves to swagger. Because anyone can't hit a moving target". #timesup. #metoo #himtoo. ðŸ“· @cramos7

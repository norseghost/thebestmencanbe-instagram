In May 2018, a prostitute told her parole officer that Darin Thomas wanted to pay her to find him some underage girls. He was then set up by a detective through text messages, who later said, “It took me a week to get you to say the wrong thing.” Darin was jailed for 11 days, including 5 days in solitary confinement. If found guilty, he could have faced life in prison.

It took until late April 2019 for the charges to be dropped. By then, Darin's mugshot had been put on TV and in newspapers. After losing his job of 24 years, he's had difficulty finding work because anyone who looked up his name would find out about the charges.

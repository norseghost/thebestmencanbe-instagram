Lady in Red.

Dark. 
Dusty. 
Dried lips. 
Rags. 
Red eyes. 
Road side.

She stretched her arms out lying, almost dragging her body as if she was paralysed.

I was driving my car, middle of the night , through the highway, listening to the radio, when I heard her as she cried.

Brakes. 
Screeched. 
Stepped out. 
Reached. 
A chill ran down my spine as I heard the rustle of the leaves, 
My Jaws had dropped and my eyes were overcome by disbelief. . 
Red. 
Red. 
Her dress was red or was it her blood? 
Her face was swollen and legs covered in mud,
As she dragged herself out from the roadside 
As a shiver swiped throughout my body from the inside. 
Dark. 
Dusty. 
Dried lips. 
Rags. 
Red eyes. 
Road side.

I had seen the worst, and she had lived a nightmare, 
But I almost held my breath, as the worst was yet not there. 
I walked over to her steadily but slow, 
I didn't realise... I didn't know.. Silence. 
Crickets noise. 
Distant howls.
Mild breeze. 
When I reached there with tears in her eye as blood poured from another, 
She whispered, her voice breaking, " Brother! They kidnapped me in a Xylo, 1111 the number", she whimpered, "Inform the police after I am dead. "
I was silent as I saw her life getting drained, 
She was someone's daughter, sister or maybe mother I thought with overwhelming grief, 
That lady in red.

Probably because they\u2019re all deleted. The only one was this. Which I posted on an old Instagram account February 2017.  But deleted due to threats, fear, and appeasement to he who shall not be named. .\n.\n.\nWriting E N E M Y was a time of darkness. But the beginning of seeing the light.  A\ud83d\udca1. It was the first time internally I realized something wasn\u2019t right.  Being in pain, crying, hating yourself when all you do is wear your heart on a sleeve just to have it laughed at, rejected, criticized, abused than wanted demanded for or else... is a mind fuck. Due to desperation I took the things other people were saying to me and looked in the mirror and acknowledged I wasn\u2019t the enemy. Repeated their voices instead of his. Told and forced myself. With tears. That I wasn\u2019t the enemy. But still remained in denial and staid due to extreme brainwash that I in fact was the enemy. I was the only person who saw Hyde. Everyone loved him. So something had to be wrong with me. Right?  It\u2019s a song that represents the internal struggle of acknowledging but also still denying.  The positive affirmations I received from loved ones remained voices in my head. But still not strong enough to over power his. Which became my demons. \nArt by: #courtneyprivett .\n.\n.\n#newmusicfriday #friday #narcissisticabuseabuse #thereishope #thefutureisfemale #shareyourstory #womenpower #art #sketch #blackandwhite #newartists #losangeles #dreamers #love #kindess #yinandyang #jekyllandhyde #metoo #metoomovement"

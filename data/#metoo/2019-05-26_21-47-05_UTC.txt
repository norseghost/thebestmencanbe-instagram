Passing laws that ban abortion is a form of sexual violence against women, men, trans and GNC folks. These kinds of systemic injustices not only negatively target people of color, but they also oppress cash poor, working class, disabled and rural Americans. This is a race, class and gender issue. We will fight for bodily autonomy for all people, always. #reproductiverights #reproductivejustice #metoomovement #metoo #abortionishealthcare

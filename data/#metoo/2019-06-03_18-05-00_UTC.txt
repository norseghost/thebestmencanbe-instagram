#AppreciationPost - I am so thankful for the amazing humans who helped me bring my vision and story to life in the “Monster” music video. @koehlvisuals has created a safe, professional, efficient work environment for the three videos we’ve done together, and I cannot thank him enough. @kayjaofficial - my longtime friend and collaborator who is the musical powerhouse behind my last four singles, and knows how to take my ideas and implement them flawlessly. He also took on the creepy role of “the hands” in the “Monster” music video. @officialandel who will hate me for posting about this again, but you were my emotional support that day, and that was as important a role as any. Thank you all for helping me make this last release such a powerful one. Link to the “Monster” music video is in my bio. #MeToo

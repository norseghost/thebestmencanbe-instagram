Research has recently shown that PTSD among military personnel may be a physical brain injury, specifically of damaged tissue, caused by blasts during combat.\n\nMost people who experience such events recover from them, but people with PTSD continue to be severely depressed and anxious for months or even years following the event. \nWomen are twice as likely to develop posttraumatic stress disorder as men, and children can also develop it. PTSD often occurs with depression, substance abuse, or other anxiety disorders.\n\nHelp Your Child Manage Traumatic Events\nRelationships, Trauma, and PTSD\n\nTrauma survivors who have PTSD may have trouble with their close family relationships or friendships. Their symptoms can cause problems with trust, closeness, communication, and problem solving, which may affect the way the survivor acts with others. In turn, the way a loved one responds to him or her affects the trauma survivor. A circular pattern may develop that could harm relationships. Source: National Center for PTSD.\n\nPTSD Facts -7.7 million Americans age 18 and older have PTSD.\n-67% of people exposed to mass violence have been shown to develop PTSD, a higher rate than those exposed to natural disasters or other types of traumatic events.\n-People who have experienced previous traumatic events run a higher risk of developing PTSD.\n-PTSD can also affect children and members of the military.\n.\nIf you like this post, follow me \u2014> @taking_over_the_asylum .\n.\n#ptsd #ptsdawareness #ptsdrecovery #cptsd #cptsdrecovery #trauma #abuse #metoo #survivor #recovery #recoveryispossible #healing #treatment #emdr #childabuse #emotionalabuse #sexualabuse #triggered #traumarecovery #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #mentalillness #endthestigma #fightthestigma #stopthestigma"

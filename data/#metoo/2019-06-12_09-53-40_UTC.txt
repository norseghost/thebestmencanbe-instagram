Most places will talk of ‘safe spaces’ and ‘fun environments’ and you get there and think HUH... we use the word empowering so often that we forget what it actually feels like to be EMPOWERED!!!! I look at these girls and the way they bring their own lives into that studio, their backgrounds, fears or insecurities, and then how they CHOOSE to slowly let go and face them head on. My aim is to create the environment but also ALLOW you ladies to be part of the change we feel in every session and moment we step in or out of that studio which creates our own freedom... it’s a journey and I love going on it with you all ❤️ 🎥 - @_sssnia

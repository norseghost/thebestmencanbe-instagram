A year ago today I was splitting my life between Boston and New York due to psychiatric hospitalization. I love snapchat memories because they remind me of how far Iâ€™ve come with the people dearest to me still by my side. I have literally stared death in the face and told it to fuck off, all with my best friend @sadietenenbaum by my side. Thank you to the mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, teachers, friends, etc. who continue to support and believe in kids who feel they have nothing and no one left rooting for them. I love you endlessly SadieðŸ’“#mentalhealthawareness #hugsomeonetoday #metoo Itâ€™s all love bby. Dare to let it in, for me. For you.

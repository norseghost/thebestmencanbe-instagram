We can\u2019t control what people do to us especially when we were young and innocent. We can see people who have abusive traits as people who are SCARED. Remember the movie Ghost when the \u201cbad guy\u201d was scared half to death by an evil spirit coming to claim him? It was dark and it was scary. This is how someone feels when they keep so much negativity inside of them. They are scared of the outside world because they are scared of THEMSELVES. They can\u2019t see themselves as an aspect of God so they have to terrorize the people around them. Unfortunately, some people with abusive characteristics are abusive because they were abused themselves as a child. All of the more reason to heal. \u2764\ufe0f"

Today I treated myself to a mile long nature walk and a @starbucks Frappuccino after sharing more of my story with my family yesterday afternoon. It’s the little things like being told ‘Were always here for you’ that remind you as a survivor you’re not alone even though during the abuse you were made to feel so isolated. Celebrate the little things today, like the fact it’s warming up in Ohio and that the sun is shining ☀️ #ptsdrecovery #ptsd #ptsdsurvivor #survivorstory #survivor #believewomen #believesurvivors #nature #recovery #naturewalks #flower #mentalhealth #mentalillness #mentalhealthawareness #anxietysupport #anxiety #depression #metoo #narcissisticabuse #domesticviolenceawareness #selflove #selfcare #loveyourself #healing #journey

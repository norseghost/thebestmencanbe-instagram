There are so many things I wish I could tell Lil Meek Meek. The most important would be, you will survive,  don't carry him with you forever, and forgive him and let him go.

Childhood trauma is extremely difficult to heal but it is possible, I am living proof.

Fun fact: I still have the blanket my mom purchased for me when I was about 9 yrs old. I can't sleep without it and it goes EVERYWHERE with me(Traveling). It has holes in it and it is so used but its my piece of comfort and security. I won't ever let it go. This blanket survived a fire with me, it is durable ðŸ˜‚

GOD IS. TRANS. A VISUAL MOVEMENT that holds a safe space for spirited queer folk. It does not JUDGE! The paintings empower spiritual fluidity that gives representation to queers who love God. The series combines my skills in printmaking, typography and portrait painting. The project includes 2D large scaled colour filled, genderless portraits and 3D installations that give visual narratives to taboo lifestyles and social barriers still present in traditional, religious practices and institutions. God is. Not male or female. GOD IS. TRANS. Honors the connection the queer body has to it’s spirit.

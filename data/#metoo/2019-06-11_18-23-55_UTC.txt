I wrote this last year and til this day it still applies to me. There are gonna be days when I have no idea who I am but knowing who you are is a learning experience. I realised that everyday there is something new about myself that I didn't know yesterday.. so no matter who I am I just notice they are both worth living !! ðŸ–¤

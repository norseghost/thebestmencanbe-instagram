My mom and dad still had to fight and run to get married because it was still taboo in the 80’s in Lubbock TX. “It's hard to believe that interracial marriage was legalized only 50 years ago. But not too long ago, interracial relationships were largely forbidden — that is, until the Loving v. Virginia case in 1967, the landmark ruling that lifted anti-miscegenation laws and made it possible for interracial couples to marry. During that case, the Supreme Court ruled that state bans on interracial marriage were unconstitutional.

Today marks the anniversary of the historic case, in which Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple from Virginia, successfully sued for the right to marry in their home state. Before then, interracial marriage was deemed a felony in several states, and, in the Lovings' case, one that could see couples separated and/or jailed. Though it may be unimaginable to us that this right was ever in question, the Lovings changed the course of history — and paved the way for interracial relationships to become as common as they are now.” - an excerpt from an article by Kimberly Truong

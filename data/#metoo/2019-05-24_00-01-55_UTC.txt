Would we care as much if we hadn't suffered ourselves? Would our hearts burn with anger against those who abuse and use others if it hadn't been done to us? We all carry pain. We have all had our share of suffering. But these sufferings that we endured and may still face in the future, will help us learn the pain and sufferings of others. And when we learn pain, we can better extend mercy. We can better extend grace. We can love others better. Pain destroys our arrogance, pride, and indifference towards others. Who better to help another who is suffering, than someone who has suffered even greater?

I found a Gem in this world of darkness.  A light of hope that brightens the soul, (My children strength the spirit). A great woman is the mother of life her ability to love is the balance.  These (her) words are the most calming, (the great @drmayaangelou), Growth is in wisdom.  A woman black or other whos love is pure and kind,  whos words are powerful enough if whispered, breaks the through the walls of damage and empowers the family.  We all suffer, we all need, we all experience abuse,  the most dangerous is verbal as it hits the core of any person (the mind,the central of you). Women with poisonus tongues devour soul, men with violent hands of no control destroy the home, a tip in the iceberg of life lessons.  As Man you need to rise above.  If you are the abuser find help become a better man.  We are all birthed so respect is on both parts.  No person is greater than the other @tgmbs (to the woman at the begin of your boooogie lol post a man has a mother he is the reason you became amother but not all mothers xan see the father in man not even elder mothers who are butter from their own mistakes) Our behaviours both men and women turn the graves of many. As young parents (people) we are on a journey, some without the guidence, love and support of there own.  If you being abused speak up #metoo  #mental health awareness #anxiety #bipolar #ptsd  A lack of something in life ruins our potential future, but we if we sit in caves, covered and warm wrap in blindness cannot see a small light. A light of hope that is search for you to help you find your way.  This was inspired by #mayaangelou @talisa.mesquitta and a light God showed. I myself wrote this.

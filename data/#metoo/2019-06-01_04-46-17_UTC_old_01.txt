It's been a long time since I posted about this because it takes a lot of strength to do it.  I know there are some people who probably don't want to see this in their newsfeed and to them I say unfriend or unfollow because EVERYTIME  I've posted about rape at least 1 person has dm'ed me to tell me they needed to hear that,  or that they went through something similar,  or that have been struggling and feel less alone.  EVERYTIME! So I'm posting again with the open invitation to dm me.  I'm gonna be honest I dont know the right things to say but I BELIEVE YOU, we'll start there....

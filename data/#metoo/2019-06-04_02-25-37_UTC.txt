Three years ago, a team of union room attendants and servers surveyed 487 women working in Chicago hotels and casinos about sexual harassment. In 2017, with the Chicago Federation of Labor, we passed the #HandsOffPantsOn ordinance to help protect Chicago hotel workers. Yesterday, Illinois became the first state in the country to pass panic button legislation for hotel AND casino workers throughout the state!  Si Se Puede!

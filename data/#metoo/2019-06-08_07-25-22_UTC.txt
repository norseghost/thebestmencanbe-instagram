Hello guys it’s A here, and I decided to make a post that is relatively controversial because as many of you know, it’s pride month. Now it’s a commonly known fact that I’m bisexual, I started off believing I was lesbian because I wasn’t all that interested in men but then there were certain males I was attracted to (for example Eef). So I’m actually apart of the demographic for pride month, and honestly I find it to be upsetting that it is necessary. Now I know this opinion is going to put me in a lot of hot water since I know not everyone believes in the LGBT movement due religious beliefs or something else. But I’d be lying if I said that LGBT people were 100% free of discrimination, perhaps in 1st world countries they’re less likely to face discrimination but in 3rd world countries there’s a possibility for the death penalty and genital mutilation for being gay. Which is why I think pride month is relatively necessary but I really wish it wasn’t. You might be wondering why I think this, well I honestly think that LGBT people around the world shouldn’t have to fight for being perceived as equal to straight people, I really don’t believe LGBT people should be killed for such a minor aspect of themselves, hence the post; my sexuality is not my personality. This also refers to things such as sex and gender, I genuinely believe that pride month shouldn’t be necessary because I know that LGBT people just want acceptance. But this also brings up something else that many people will think of when seeing this post, people who see the LGBT community as a trend. That’s the contents of my next post. I hope this post made sense because I felt like I wasn’t communicating my point thoroughly enough.

                        "text": "When my son Zac was 10, he asked me why he had never seen me cry. It was such a sad mom moment.\u00a0I had shut myself off from feelings at a very young age, & at 31 I was still completely disconnected from my feelings, physically unable to cry.\u00a0When you're an atom bomb of emotional chaos without the ability to release it through tears, the urge to hurt yourself becomes overwhelming, & self-harm was a big part of my life for 20 years. Learning how to cry opened the door to overcoming self-harm. It's been about 7 years since I've abused myself, & I'm freely able to move through my emotions with beautiful, cleansing tears!\n\nAbout a year ago, I heard Zac say \"Men don't cry\", & it got me thinking about the effect that societal message must have on men.\u00a0I know all too well what happens to your mental & emotional well being when you continually shove your feelings down,\u00a0& I can't help but wonder what the male suicide rate would look like if men did allow themselves to move through their emotions with tears. What shifts would happen in our society if we saw vulnerability as a strength & not a weakness? \nI thought the #metoo movement was great, but I had a serious issue with it just being women, & now that our country is embroiled in the topic of abortion, I'm once again wondering where the fuck are the men? My heart longs for a movement of vulnerability from the men in our lives. A #metoo2 movement, bringing awareness to the serious reality of the child molestation epidemic going on in this country. A movement of men speaking up for the women they supported through an abortion. A movement of men willing to stand up & say no more to this \"Men don't cry\" bullshit. \"Vulnerability is not weakness; I would argue that it is our greatest measure of courage\"... #brenebrown \n#metoo #metoo2 #vulnerability #abortion #selfharm #change #revolution #mattzhaig #suicide #suicideprevention #mendontcry #mentalhealth #mentalhealthadvocate #support #speakup #warriorgoddess #sacredsons"

Ever heard of the HeforShe Seven Principles???
-
A HeforShe:
-  1. Believes: that discrimination against women and girls is wrong; that violence against them is unacceptable; and that they should have equal access to social, political and economic opportunities.

2. Understands: that standing up for gender equality is standing up for humanity.

3. Encourages: women and girls to seek social and economic opportunities.

4. Speaks: when he sees any forms of discrimination, whether interpersonal or institutional.

5. Leads: by setting an example in his family and community by enacting equality in everyday actions.

6. Challenges: other men and boys if he sees them acting or speaking in a way that is discriminatory or harassing to women and girls.

7. Supports: other men and women as they work for a world in which discrimination and violence against women is eliminated

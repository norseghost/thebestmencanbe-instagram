🌻ON BEING A GIRL🌻
.
TRIGGER WARNING: references to abuse of various kinds
.
When I was 4 or 5 (I don’t know); I was sexually abused by my Dad’s friend and boss in the night. I was woken in my sleep. I still remember every detail. I was confused and frozen. He was in his 30’s and had two daughters of his own. I told no one for over ten years because he told me to keep it secret
.
When I was 8 years old a boy a year older than me exposed himself to me and another friend in the hope of sex
.
When I was 10 years old boys started wanting to touch me. I avoided it as long as I could. But realised there was an expectation around not being “frigid”
.
When I was 11 years old and I was walking along my local streets, tradesman started beeping at me and gawking at me and yelling out sexualised comments about my body. Some of these men were in their 40’s
.
When I was twelve; a boy sat next to me put his hands down my shirt and felt my breasts. He was not a boyfriend. He was just a guy I knew. I froze and did and said nothing. I had no thought that my body was my own
.
When I was twelve years old my sexual experiences began. I was in year 7 and 8. I never initiated and didn’t want to. But felt in order to be accepted that I had to play the game. I was mostly drunk when they happened
.
When I was 13 a tourist boy a few years older than me in crescent head brought me into his tent and begged me to do things I didn’t want to do. I said no twenty or so times but he kept begging and pushing my head where he wanted me to go. Eventually a power shift occurred where I was now depriving him of something he needed and deserved. So I played the good girl and did what I was told. His name was Joel. He was from the central coast. I wonder where he is now
.
When I was 14 I got my first serious boyfriend and I lost my virginity. It was both of our decision. Consent. But regret when we went to school the next day and everyone knew
.
When I was 15 I had a new boyfriend. He was obsessed with me and I loved it. In the first two weeks we were together I kissed another boy on the lips. I was a cheater. But I hid it from my boyfriend. He started to behave strangely. Controlling what I wore👇🏼

I am learning to reach for the stars, be the star of my own play, because in this life we lose so much through attachment and expectations.  We expect people are going to treat us a certain way based on how we feel about ourself.  So, if I feel I am a person of integrity, then my expectation of you would to be a person of integrity. ~ Expect nothing.💚
I then begin to believe my expectation of you, I am feeding off the “bliss molecule” being released into my Endocannabinoid System.  I feel “love”, beautiful, needed, wanted, and then I am disappointed, because you are not who “I” wanted you to be.🙏
I then become attached to the fantasy I have created between us.  As we begin to become our “true” self,  the expectation is ruined, but the attachment keeps us together;  therefore, I lose who I am and you lose who you are.💔
Cannabis is teaching me how to heal.  The love you need is right inside you, but it’s like work or school you must study.  Life will expose you to it exactly when your meant to have it.💯 Love Always,
Nurse Nique

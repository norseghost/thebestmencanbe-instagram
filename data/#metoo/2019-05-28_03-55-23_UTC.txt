Marilyn Webb is a feminist and anti-war activist, author, journalist and professor. She was a doctoral student finishing her coursework in Psychology in 1967 when she asked two distinguished (male) professors in her field to serve on her dissertation committee. One said he'd do it if he could go to her apartment and give her baths. The other pushed her against the wall and physically assaulted her. “There was no word for sexual harassment," she said, "there was no language for this, there was no Title IX, no administrator to report it to.” So, feeling like it was her fault, she left the PhD program and moved to Washington, DC. There she, along with a few friends, formed the off our backs collective in 1970, a fundamental second wave feminist periodical. She went on to be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, among other pretty amazing professional achievements. But in 2017, inspired by the #metoo movement and as a 75th birthday present to herself, she started thinking about that derailed PhD again. She decided to contact the University of Chicago and tell them what happened. They investigated, reviewed her work and found her story credible, so they formed a dissertation committee - this time two women and black man - and accepted a book she had published as her dissertation. Next month she will receive that PhD at graduation ceremonies.

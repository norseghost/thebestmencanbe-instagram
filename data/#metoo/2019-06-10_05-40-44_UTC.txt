I'm happy to say I'm finally back on my anxiety medication and out of withdrawals. It's crazy to see the difference of me on vs off my meds. Mental health is so much more important than some would believe, and I've seen first hand the way those people treat those of us who suffer from a disorder. It hurts to be made to feel like you're not worth another human beings time because of you're "made up" affliction. #mentalhealthawareness #metoo #itdoesmatter #iamworthy

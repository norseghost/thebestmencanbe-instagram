Bob from Jersey shared his incredibly personal story: ⠀
⠀
"I am now 57 (Jan 14th).⠀
⠀
While I served in the US Navy, I was raped at age 19 when I attended school.  I repressed what happened to me for 32 years.  Up to that point I engaged in self-sabotage and self destructive behavior, and remained frustrated why I was doing that to myself.  Throughout my life I have always been a reluctant leader who is outgoing.  I have always done my best to be a good man, honorable, trustworthy, lovable among other positive traits.  I held jobs sporadically after I left the service despite trying to do more.  It seemed I would rise to the top and self-destruct along the way.⠀
⠀
While working in Washington, D.C. for the Veterans of Foreign Wars as Legislative Chairman for the State of Connecticut, the memory of my rape returned while in a Congressman's office with other state leaders of the VFW.  It was from that day forward my life got turned upside down.  For better or worse, I ceased to be the man I was.  I was in a downward spiral; I had no healthy coping mechanisms, so I drank.  I was diagnosed with PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder; I had frequent panic attacks and was not at all functional.  I have spent the past 5 1/2 years in multiple modes of therapy, and while I am doing better in most regards, I have lost everything but my service dog.  I lost my 31-year marriage (though that was more than just my mental illnesses that contributed to it), my relationship with my children, and my domicile. This is the period of transformation in which I find myself, and I am hoping for an artistic representation of that struggle through to the projection of a positive outcome for my life where I am whole."⠀
When asked if it was OK for us to share his story, he wrote: "people who have been through a similar personal trauma NEED to know they’re not alone". ⠀

Thank you.⠀

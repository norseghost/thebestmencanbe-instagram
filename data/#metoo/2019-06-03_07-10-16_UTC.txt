Hilma af Klint(1862–1944)

Hilma af Klint was a Swedish artist whose paintings were among the first abstract art. However, she was overlooked with her male peers, including Piet Mondrian and Wassily Kandinsky, receiving the limelight. A considerable body of her abstract work predates the first purely abstract compositions by Kandinsky.
Klint belonged to a group called The Five, a circle of women who shared her belief in the importance of trying to make contact with the so-called High Masters —often by way of séances. Her paintings, which sometimes resemble diagrams, were a visual representation of complex spiritual ideas.

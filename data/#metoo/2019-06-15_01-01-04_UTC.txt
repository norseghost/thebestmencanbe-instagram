“Your Ass.” I’ve sold paintings for twenty years and always with a strict “artist not included policy.” A few years ago, one of my long-time collectors tried to buy me. I offered him the opportunity to purchase this painting (a tracing of myself) instead, but he declined. This and other pieces that have been in storage are now avail for 500$ or less (to good, sweet art appreciating homes!).

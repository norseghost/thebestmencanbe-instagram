Be confident!
Do you!
Be heard!
Speak up!

We are all shouting out to empower women, make our voices heard, to #speakup! But what if you find that really hard?? We can‚Äôt all be uber confident women. Some of us are naturally more shy, more quiet.

That‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make shy women boring. Or weak. Or not worthy of being heard. It usually just means they need more time and more opportunity... Look out for quieter ladies. Ask them what they think, give them the space to be heard too üëç

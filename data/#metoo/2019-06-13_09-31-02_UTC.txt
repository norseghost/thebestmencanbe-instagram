Women abuse is widespread across the world and is rarely discussed, partly due to the shame felt by sufferer, or due to fear of reprisals at work. With India's #metoo movement, we have seen the status quo being challenged.
We as an artist felt the need to support this #cause with our #music, to empower women and make society more inclusive.

Our upcoming #song is a message across the world that being a survivor of sexual violence is nothing to be ashamed of, it is the aggressor who is in the bad light.
Itâ€™s all about creating awareness and giving women the strength, to raise their voices.

Stay strong #women! The entire nation stands by you.

Watch this space for more.

The American Psychiatric Association recently released a study done by the Center for Disease Control that stated 1 in 3 girls and 1 in 6 boys is sexually abused before they are 18 years old. That translates into millions of victims in the U.S. alone.  Because of the shame associated with that abuse, most victims remain silent. That untreated  trauma presents itself as PTSD, addictions, mental health disorders, and other debilitating and self-destructive behaviors. And still—victims remain silent.  I have a Masters degree in counseling and was a licensed social worker and in spite of that education and licensure, I still lived in the silence of shame for 45 years, allowing that pain to destroy my life. That is how powerful the stranglehold of sexual abuse is on a life. 
I realize many victims may not have the ability, for whatever reason, to speak out, and so I am speaking up for myself and victims everywhere.  I have a voice and I’m standing by those who feel they have lost theirs. 
Slay the shame—Allow victims to heal—End sexual violence.

Set Boundaries.
A healthy relationship means they are your PEACE, not your PROBLEM.
Narcissists make the environment very hostile. You're walking on eggshells and they might stone wall you or give you the silent treatment. 
Stonewalling is basically answering a question with a question. The reason why they do this is because they're not problem solvers. Instead of solving the problem they want to create more drama around it. They get narcisistic supply from it, they want to play a game with you by not giving you a direct answer. They don't want to give you CLOSURE, they want to create tension, start conversations, arguments, and debates and the never want to solve or resolve issues. So again they're getting narcisistic supply and pleasure by keeping this drama going and this negative energy going.
When you call them on their bad behaviours and their wrongdoings, they'll give you the silence treatment.

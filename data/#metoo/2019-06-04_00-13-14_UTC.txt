“two front doors”

a string of sorries 
that come attached 
with conjunctions. “i’m sorry
but
living in a society where the woman is 
automatically believed is scary 
to me as the mother of
two boys”

but
what if 
you had a 
daughter who showed 
you the texts and you still 
didn’t believe her until two years later?

Creativity.
Today Iâ€™m painting for my creative brain.
I was born to create. With anything I do, I make it art. When I grabbed these boxes, all I knew is that I wanted to paint. I didnâ€™t know what was to become of them. But quickly I was inspired to use my tetrachromatic skills, and put colors together that no one usually thinks of.

My family kept asking me who these were for, and I still have no idea. Should I give em to a friend? Should I sell em? Iâ€™m unable to work, because of my health conditions...so it wouldnâ€™t be a bad idea to have some supplemental income. However, I just want to create.
P.S. I didnâ€™t plan for the little bird to peek through...it just sort of happened that way!

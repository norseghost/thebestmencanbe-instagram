Thank you to the amazing artist and activist @michelepred for raising a basic issue: “my body my business” and “believe women”. I have been touched recently and in the past two years by a case of a close friend to my husband who turned to be women’s worst enemy. From psychological harassment to lowering OUR own self worth, to unacceptable sexual behaviour, to lies etc the list goes on! Something radical in the world has to change and I’m grateful that more and more women in the world are coming together, they are speaking out the truth and are not afraid - WE are supporting each other, don’t forget  #metoo is still relevant everyday. #mybodymybusiness #believewomen #anewerabegins

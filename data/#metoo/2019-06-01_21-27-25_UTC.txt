This piece is a little different from my usual, but I was asked to take part in a local art show tonight. A friend whoâ€™s organizing the event mentioned a sketch I posted on my art account @ashe_does so I recreated it as a miniature wall. My hands hurt when I draw, but minis are easier to make.  Shoutout to @bentleyhouseminis who did an excellent graffiti tutorial on her Youtube channel! #metoo #miniatures

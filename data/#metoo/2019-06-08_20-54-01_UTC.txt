This is sickening. Sudan’s dictator was killed by his generals in a coup. A transitional military council was formed to rule Sudan. Protesters started to demand a transfer to civilian control. The council resisted but continued to discuss potential compromises. In the beginning of June, Sudan’s security forces started firing on a major protesters camp outside the capital. Dozens were shot and killed. Since then, more then 50 bodies have been pulled from the Nile river, dozens of women and 6 men have been raped, women’s underwear are being held up like flags, new tear gas weapons are causing mass amounts of damage, and it seems like it’s only going to get worse. People are dying and I haven’t heard anything about it. People need to know about this. ~Alex •Follow us! •We do shoutouts on our story!

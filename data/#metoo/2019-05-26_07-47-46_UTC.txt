DAY 26- Itâ€™s time to listen to older women. 
Sexuality can be difficult for everyone to talk about however for older women there is often additional barriers and shame that prevent them disclosing abuse. Ageism, sexism, and the belief that family is always caregiving can impact recognition of elder sexual abuse which often concurs with other types of abuse.

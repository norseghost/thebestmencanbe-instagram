It’s never easy on Father’s Day... For many reasons. Not many people can truly grasp the complexity of my situation and that’s okay. It’s my battle and journey to work through. I do want to take a moment to send encouragement to those who need it. 💔

Tonight I am praying for all those who had to fight / are fighting against the greatness of who someone was / is alone. Their greatness made / makes the truth nearly impossible to believe. It’s not easy. Yes, we are making great progress but rejection is still a huge part of disclosure. I pray that we find the peace we deserve. ❤️ #metoo @speakashleynicole

A last minute photo of one I didn’t bother to finish. I used to enjoy this series but the last couple had such an idealised version of parenthood it irritated me and this one - FINAL STRAW.  Without going into any detail our main character in this series wealthy Scottish philosopher cum mystery solver, Isabel Dalhousie, has a #MeToo moment and, being the idealised woman of a white male’s imagination she just decided, yes ‘decides’ not to feel victimised about it. Of course she reports it to the police, who are so kind and helpful and then she moves on because ‘nothing really happened’. FUCK THAT BULLSHIT! Done. So into the bin/returns slot with this. #AlexanderMccallSmith #thequietsideofpassion #badbooks #reading #bookworm #bookstagram #lovetoread #bookreview #worstbookever #ilovelibraries #scottishbooks

Here is the #hypocrisy of #hollywood !!
They call awareness to the #metoo movement which was way overdue... But, some producer and their cast #deniserichards #lisarinna for #bravo tv thought it was perfectly ok to air this segment about (happy ending) #massage 
How about the therapist who was asked to do this (apparent legalized) prostitution hand job? Did she feel safe? Did she feel she had to do this because they were celebrities or was she a sick person that needs help? Why is #bravo not held responsible for not reporting? 
If any ignorant person says, “ All forms of healthcare are misrepresented then they are obviously missing the point.” This was aired on national television as a joke. I’m not easily offended so I could care less however it’s important to #speakup and say if you’re a therapist doing this or a person asking for this, both should be held accountable!! I have dedicated my life to being a #massagetherapist the old fashioned way ( apparently) $20,000.00 in student loans. Plus Continuing education and license renewal every three years. Not to mention the physical hurt to my body everyday. I love what I do so I’m not complaining. I want to show others how disgusting and unfair our society is. Especially coming from the very people who want  #awareness

I rarely go to Mass at the church that I work for, but I did today, and *of course* I got asked to do the sprinkling rite.
-
If you're not familiar with this catholic / christian ritual, it's basically taking a bowl of blessed water and an evergreen branch & dipping the branch in the water and flinging the water at people.
-
It's supposed to represent renewing the promises you (read: your parents) made at your baptism, but mostly it's just really fun to fling water at people with a branch and not be questioned or scolded.
-
Recently though, I've been having having some of my shit kicked up around body image stuff, so part of me really didn't want to get up in front of the entire fucking church with everyone watching my every move.
-
But.
-
I did it anyways and you know what?
-
I was able to focus more on the joy and amusement I got from flinging water at people than on any potential judgement about my body.
-
I was able to focus on what my body enjoyed doing rather than on how others perceived my body.
-
I was able to let go and just be with myself.
-
I'm pretty proud of myself.

For anyone struggling with being affected by sexual assault, know it gets easier. Know that they no longer have control over you and that you hold all the power. It never leaves you but it does get easier.
Four years ago, I was a wreck, three years ago I was still suffering from extreme PTSD, two years ago I was depressed, and one year ago I tried to distract myself by keeping busy. Yesterday I didn't even realize it had been four years.

Everyone heals differently but know that you will heal.

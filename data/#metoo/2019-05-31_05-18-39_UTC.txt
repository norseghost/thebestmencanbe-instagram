So you truly understand where I am coming from when I am talking about #reproductiverights #reproductivejustice #abortionrights. I am a survivor of multiple counts of rape and incest from 2-26. My life would be very different today if I had been impregnated by my father and then forced to give birth. Knowing me, I would have tried to self-induce an abortion and likely would have died. These anti-choice laws nationwide that criminalize victims are rooted in deep seeded misogyny. Because of these laws written and voted on by mostly white cis men, more innocent people are going to dieâ€”people who were already hurt so much. #metoo #survivor

A national monument honouring survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence will be displayed in Washington D.C.. The Monument Quilt features a collection of over 3,000 stories of sexual assault and domestic violence, and is a testament to the power and importance of our stories. As organiser Lorena Kourousias has said, “by blanketing the national mall, we are asking for space for survivors to heal”. We are so grateful that stories like this are being recognised globally.

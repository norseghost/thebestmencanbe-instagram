JAN FABRE was accused of sexual harassment by twenty of his dancers which he used to call his "warriors of beauty". When they resisted against his "manipulative battle" in an open letter his company Troubleyn wrote in their official respond: "It's no secret that Jan has a strong personality and a straightforward style as a director." AMAZING!

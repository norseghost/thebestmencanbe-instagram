i have come to know this poet as one of the most complicated and brilliant minds. the creativity and hard work that goes into whatâ€™s posted on this account is just... stunning. this is a piece by @e.mpoetry and the creative formatting doesnâ€™t stop here. scrolling through her page, you will find long pieces, short pieces, and formatted works of art. enjoy(:

How do you know when you’re in a toxic situation? There are signs, right? We see them in relationships, families, careers.… and churches too. The church has taken a lot of hits in the past several years. Abuse. Scandals. Corruption. They even found themselves in the middle of the #metoo movement. I’m not standing in line to throw rocks at the church. I love the church. She is the bride of Jesus. And that’s why He issues so many warnings about toxic leaders in the church. We’re going to tackle that issue this Sunday as we wrap up our series: “Questioning Jesus.” Hope you can join us!

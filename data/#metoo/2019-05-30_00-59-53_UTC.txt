I love myself even though I need eyebrow help. I am beautiful . My heart makes more beautiful than beauty itself. No I am not full of myself. I just know that I am who I am because of my scorned past #metoo , being a #fosterkid , being abused in so many ways. My past does not define me but makes me who I am. I'm tired of hating myself because of what I did or what I have been through. Today I love myself. ( my eyebrows suck)

#MeToo one year ago on Facebook. Thanks for the reminder, @facebook, for the failure on your part to remove this account for months, despite repeat requests, demands, and begging. The page used my full legal name to sell porn and sex. It was active for at least two months. I wonder how much money it made the company, and how much time, money, and spirit it cost me to get it removed. #NiUnaMenos.

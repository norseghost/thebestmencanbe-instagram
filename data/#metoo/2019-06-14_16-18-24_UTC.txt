One year ago today, “Man School: Relating with Women in the #MeToo Era” was released!  Within a couple of months, I was able to update the cover to include the fact that it became a #1 New Release on Amazon in 6 categories! (Thank you Jordan Ancel for that awesome cover). I’m excited to share that many libraries have purchased the book all over the country and some schools have it available to their students as well. There is still much work to be done, and “Man School 2: Sex, Intimacy and Dating” is on the way. “Man School” is available at Amazon.

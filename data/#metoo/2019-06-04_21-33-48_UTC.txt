"The right of citizens...to vote shall not be denied...on account of sex." On June 4th, 1919, the U.S. Senate passed the 19th Amendment by two votes over its two-thirds required majority, 56-25, winning many women the right to vote. This amendment, officially ratified in 1920, prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex on a national level. 
Now, we have a record number of women in Congress, six women running for President, and the first female Speaker of the House. Women may be in our political world now, but we must remember the fight they undertook for for the most basic level of participation - the right to vote.Today we celebrate 100 years of women's suffrage and recognize the work we still need to do for womenâ€™s rights and voting rights - for all. .

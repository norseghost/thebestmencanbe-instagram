My BII sister Diane just explanted her toc-sick silicone implants on Friday! Sending love and prayers for health and healing. This woman is a WARRIOR and we’re so excited to be working together as a team of support for you ladies! I remember this day like it was yesterday. ❤️

Let the healing begin. Surgery is done! #explant successful! I am in a beautiful place. Angels are with me and that includes you my friend! On our way home to sleep, rest and rejuvenate. My surgeon Dr Bradley Strawn is a beautiful angel. I have felt his care and love every step of the way!

I love you guys so much! Thank you for all of your prayers and light. God I am in awe at how I can physically feel all of you!

Catherine Mayer is an American-born British author and journalist, and the co-founder of the Women's Equality Party (WE) in the UK.

She was recently named one of the Top 100 Most Influential People in Global Policy on Gender Equality. Cometh the hour, Cometh the women. In this inspirational book, the co-founder of the Women's Equality Party sets out compelling evidence for the social and economic benefits of gender equality and lays bare the mechanisms holding women back. Everywhere women are, at best, second-class citizens. Progress towards equality hasn't only stalled; in many places, it is reversing. Things needn't be this way.

Join the author on a journey to Equalia, the gender-equal future that could be ours. In this new and fully updated edition Catherine Mayer reports from the frontline of 2017, a tumultuous year that saw women's rights and protections rolled back and the global tally of female leaders fall, but galvanised feminism. It was also a tumultuous year for the author herself, who for the first time writes in detail about her sex and age discrimination suit against her former employer, TIME, and how her battle for justice, like #MeToo, demonstrated the extraordinary power of women sharing stories. .

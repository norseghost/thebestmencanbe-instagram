@taylorswift When I decided to come forward publicly about being groped by an employee of my university married to the chancellor of my university last fall, I thought my entire world was ending. Overnight, as I called on the chancellor to resign, I was being attacked from all angles. Reporters showed up at my home a month after my wedding as I dealt with flashbacks of a man putting his hand up my skirt and harassing me for years. Then, the internet comments rolled in. I started serving on the city council when I was 20, because I wanted to make change. I wanted to use my voice for good. Others felt it gave them a license to attack me even as an assault victim. I remember crying to “Call It What You Want,” because I felt my crown was gone but my husband wasn’t. I’ve finally reached a point in counseling when things are working. SIX more women came forward to investigators because I told the truth. I needed a positive way to remind myself those comments on the internet don’t matter—and today, you gave me that. You’ve always given me strength, but this, this matters so much. Thank you. To @taylornation, thank you for keeping the fans happy and supported and making so much available to us. Now, back to repeating this song. #taylorswiftfanpage #ts7 #taylurking #taylorswift #metoo #youneedtocalmdown #thankyou #lover #swiftie #weallhavecrowns #onrepeat

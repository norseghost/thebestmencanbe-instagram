One of my all time favorite characters in the Bible is Queen Esther. I love how imperfect her story is — how in some ways she was “just a pretty face” and yet God uses her for so much more. But her story is really complicated and definitely rated R.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I was thinking recently about how to relay Esther’s story accurately for a young audience, when the thought struck me—how many stories in the Bible do I misunderstand because I only heard them once as a child?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you haven’t read about these characters as an adult, you might still think of Esther as a beauty contest winner instead of a victim forced into a foreign harem. We learn so much of our Bible’s narrative as children, but what might we uncover if we re-engage with these stories once we are old enough to have kids of our own?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
What Bible story have you reread as an adult and seen in a new way?

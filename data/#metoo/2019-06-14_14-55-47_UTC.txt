I talk about this all the time: What does it take to really get ourselves up and over the hump of divorce, especially when it’s been contentious and we’re just exhausted? *

This is the answer: we need to start getting super comfortable with self love, meditation and surrender. *

Surrender. It’s a good word. It will take you where you need to go. *

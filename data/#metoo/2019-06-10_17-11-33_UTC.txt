Repost @christian_the_herbivore: ”There’s dozens and dozens of non-dairy alternatives and I haven’t tried all of them but these are my favorites.

There’s zero need for dairy with all these options especially when there’s healthier, more sustainable options with no use of animals. Many people are realizing this and that’s why thousands of dairy farms are closing. In 2018 alone, 2,700 U.S dairy farms closed with a $1.1 billion dollar drop in sales.

Here’s some facts that you should know. Slide to the left.
• Cows milk does not build strong bones. The top leading countries who consume milk are exactly the same who lead in osteoporosis, fractures and broken bones.
• It’s legal for dairy to have pus and poop because it’s difficult to get rid of it.
• All dairy cows must have a baby to produce milk.
•Male calves are useless in the dairy industry.
•The veal industry is the dairy industry.
•Calves are separated from their mothers moments after birth so that they don’t drink their mothers milk.
•Cows become unprofitable when they stop producing milk and are sent to slaughter. It makes zero financial sense to keep them.”

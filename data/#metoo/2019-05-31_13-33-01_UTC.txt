I’m really pleased this tweet resonated with a lot of people. And I hope it makes men pause. The advent of social media has made it easier for me to notice if/when certain people in my circles have a habit of weighing in on causes of sexual assault and/or domestic violence. If I notice a guy always sides with the (alleged or confirmed) abuser, I take note because they’re telling me they’re not safe.⠀
⠀
Our society has normalized many myths about gendered violence (women exaggerate; it’s just a misunderstanding; women lie for personal gain). These are the same excuses survivors have heard from their own abusers. When we see you repeating that same harmful rhetoric, we take note.⠀
⠀
Community response can have a large impact on trauma; if there is betrayal after a survivor comes forward, it can worsen their PTSD and make it harder to recover. We need people who can sympathize and empathize with survivors, not abusers—they already have 99.% of the world on their side.⠀
⠀
#survivorsarewatching and we have those gut feelings for a reason. If you find yourself defending or excusing abusers, try to figure out what you need to unlearn to see the reality of survivorhood. Speaking up is not a decision taken lightly.⠀

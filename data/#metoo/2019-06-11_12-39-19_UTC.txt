We work so hard farming and designing. We’ve grown and cared for every little seed from start, hand dyed the silks and put it artfully together. When we are finally at a wedding setting up, going up and down ladders, carrying heavy buckets, and fixing and refreshing every stem we are so incredibly proud and honestly, probably coming off of four days of marathon hours to make the day great. So, when we go to pin on the boutonnières we don’t want to be sexually harassed. There is often a lot of drinking and it’s an intimate moment where we are pushing pins on groom’s men. I’ve been doing weddings for six years and it’s common to be harassed in this moment. We aren’t at your bachelor party and if I see my staff being harassed that’s on me to protect them at our work place. Come on brothers, respect us, respect our work and keep it classy. #wepackpruners

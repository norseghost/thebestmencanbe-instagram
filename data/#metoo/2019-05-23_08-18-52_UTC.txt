Growing up, I got used to hearing all kinds of things on a daily basis that rendered femininity as something weak & degrading.⠀
⠀
Not only femininity, but natural human things like showing emotions, caring about looks, not being interested in certain sports.⠀
⠀
I know, this doesn’t seem to have too much to do with your personal development or your business -⠀
Or does it?!⠀
⠀
Even as a woman, we tend to down-play some of our natural traits and preferences, in order to appear more tough and invincible.⠀
⠀
But what would happen if you embraced all your softness, all your strength, all that makes you you - als detach from gender roles?⠀
⠀
What would happen if you decided to show up unmasked and real, standing proud in your power and identity?⠀
⠀
What would it mean to you to let go of societal norms that were put on you & invited in that playful, original, true, edgy you?⠀
⠀
How would it feel to be seen and loved for exactly who you are?⠀
⠀
It’s not about fitting in, it’s about belonging - and there’s no better way to find your tribe of humans, beings, followers or  clients than to be totally and unapologetically yourself.⠀
⠀
Stay true babe ✨⠀

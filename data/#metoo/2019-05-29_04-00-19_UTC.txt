Whenever you are creating beauty around you, you are restoring your own soul. It is not the strength of the body that counts, but the strength of the spirit.💜•

We found a baby humming bird in a water drain. 🌧 So I stuck my hand in and got the baby out. 💪🏿 The mother was watching us from a distance. 🛩 We put the baby on a tree branch far away from the drain. 🌳Making sure the mother saw where her baby was. 🕊 We then watched from a distance. 🎍 Soon we saw the mom hummingbird come and feed her baby. ☘️ they were back together and happy. 🌸 We wish the mother and the baby hummingbird a happy life 🌷•

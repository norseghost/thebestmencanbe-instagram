From @curtisbrown.ltd -  Today marks the culmination of nearly 20 years of dogged investigative journalism for @jimderogatis7791 in the form of SOULLESS: THE CASE AGAINST R. KELLY. Jim has been tirelessly researching, interviewing, and publishing pieces on the rapper and singer over the last two decades, after having received an anonymous fax in 2000 containing the first of what would be countless accusations of horrifying misconduct. Even as victims’ voices remain silenced by the media and records continue to sell, both Jim and the brave women who have spoken out against their abuser have not wavered in their goal of prosecution and punishment for R. Kelly, and the result is this comprehensive account of damning evidence and testimony. “There really isn’t anyone more qualified to write about the saga of R. Kelly than Jim DeRogatis,” says @taranajaneen, founder of the #MeToo movement. “We really only need to hear from Jim.”

                        "text": "LONG POST AHEAD. \u25feThrough puberty, family members would make comments on how \u201clarge\u201d my breasts were becoming (they are average). This made me develop a complex over my breasts that I still struggle with to this day. I've always hated them and wished they were smaller. \u25feDuring Young Womens, ages 13-15, I would be ignored or treated badly by the other girls because I dressed and looked different or \u201cimmodest\u201d. I was constantly berated by family members to dress more appropriately.\u25feI would go on walks to the gas station to get treats. I got catcalled every single time on those walks. Every single time. I was 14. Men would wolf whistle or make comments about my ass.\u25feI got in trouble for wearing tights that were sheer and had black intricate designs on them. I was told that \u201cthe older men at church are staring\u201d. It was my responsibility. I was 15.\u25feA teenage boy wolf-whistled at me in the library. I was was trying to find Anne Rice books. I was 16. A family member said \u201che's just being a boy\u201d.\u25fe\nI tried reporting a student for sexual harassment. I got in trouble with a teacher for \u201crumor spreading\u201d.\u25feAnother student \u201caccidentally\u201d groped my breast when trying to sit down with me and my boyfriend on the couch in the hallway. I was 17.\u25feI was on a date with my boyfriend in Salt Lake city, we were waiting for the public transit. A passing truck full of men passed by and yelled at us \u201cDid you fuck her? I did!\u201d. I was 18.\u25feA close family member committed voyeurism and filmed me and my boyfriend being intimate without our knowledge. He admitted to wanting to use it as blackmail. I was 19. His parents act like nothing happened.\u25feI stopped going on walks by myself because it caused so much anxiety. I felt like an object, something to be yelled at. I stopped dressing the way I did because I thought it attracted too much attention. It was my fault. It was my fault.\u25feWhen we were getting my fiance fitted for the wedding, I had red hair. The manager at Men's Warehouse asked \u201cDoes she have a ..fiery personality?\u201d While looking me up and down. He was well into his 60's.\u25feA close family friend committed voyeurism and tried to film me undressing. I had a panic attack. This was last year."

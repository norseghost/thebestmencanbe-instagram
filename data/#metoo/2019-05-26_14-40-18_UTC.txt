Your self, your life, your deepest thoughts, your truest feelings, your time, talent and attention are not trivial. They are vital. You have a role to play in your own adventure and the lives of everyone you touch. And nobody can tell you what role you are assigned. You discover and choose who you are for yourself. #mentalhealthawarenessmonth #selflove #metoo #mentoo #believewomen #timesup #churchtoo #christendomtoo #christendomcollege

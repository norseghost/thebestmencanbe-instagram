The Entertainment MeToo victims might lose a second time. “The very same people who publicly applaud you for speaking up about bad behavior will never hire you into their own organizations because you are forever pegged as a whistleblower and a troublemaker,” said a woman who sued a large corporation for sexual harassment.

It’s easy to forget, among headlines about $20 million settlements, that the vast majority of women who sue their employers aren’t trading lucrative careers for lucrative payouts. On the contrary: “The people who say we went for money . . . I made money working,” a former network anchor explained. “Getting a settlement, paying a fortune to lawyers and taxes, left me with nothing. And now many of us can’t get jobs again in TV. So how did that help us? How are we benefiting? We aren’t.” A former network anchor, who believes she has been blacklisted after filing a sexual harassment lawsuit, offered advice to women who are considering suing their company. “Tread carefully and make sure you are ready to face the fallout of being a whistleblower, with consequences that could include being labeled a troublemaker and a liar,” she told me. “Most importantly, don’t join a company that has a poor track record in dealing with sexual harassment complaints.” Share your experience.

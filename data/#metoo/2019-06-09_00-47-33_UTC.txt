I will admit I can a bit mysterious.
To some seem abit delrious
As I am trying to navigate myself through all the trauma Ive been through

I blocked out alot of painful memories.
Than tend to come back haunting in the forms of new people.
Its easier for me to make a list of what hasnt happened to me

My sexual trauma stems from kindergarden with gaps in between to my 20s.
I was quite a curvy child 
Which created alot of animosity, and predator situations at an early age
I was taught not to speak on things that hurt me. 
Im still unlearning, processing and healing.

I wish someone explain to me 
That on top of all my mental illnes 
That constant abuse from 13 years could gift me ptsd
I am a tired
I have been abused, beaten, kidnapped, threatened,set up, held at gun point, molested, raped I could go on.

I had suicidal plans since the 7th grade.
I fight sometimes everyday to want here
Ive overcame so much
Which why my tolerance is so less.
Not putting up with no one elses shit as I continue to roam the rest of my time. 
I dont want no sympathy sex after this shit either.

I just wanted some of yall to be aware of how you treat your friends you cant comprehend.
Tired of people seeing others drowning yet pretending they cant hear the screams.

People always ask what inspires me the truth is it lies within my trauma the constant fight to just be.

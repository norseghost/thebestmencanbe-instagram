These are a few moments of kindness we were able to give these innocent babies last night in Los Angeles. Do you see their eyes?? They are no different from ours. They wonder, and feel, and are grateful & scared, all at the same time. They are dead now. While we were able to come home, to a warm bed they were murdered, and chopped up into pieces. ðŸ’” This is the part that tears me up inside. There is no rest, no peace, & no love shown to these babies, except for the brief moments the activists are able to give. They live a life of suffering, and if you are not Vegan, you are funding this! We will not stop sharing their faces, their sounds. These are the eyes of your fellow earthlings. Your brother's & sister's. We are all connected. ðŸ’š

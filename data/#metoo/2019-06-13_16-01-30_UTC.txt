Truama impact doesn't fully define a victim's persona. They also experience resiliency, fearlessness, determination, highentend sensitivity, highly intuitive, creativity, think outside the box, empathy, strength, bravery, and so much more. When we begin to see victims as whole people who have talents and gifts then we counteract these negative impacts by building self esteem, confidence, inner wisdom, trust and community. At Shyne San Diego we believe survivors hold the keys to unlocking their own freedom from within and are the natural leaders forward in addressing the complex issues of sex trafficking.

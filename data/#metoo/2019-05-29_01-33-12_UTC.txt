"No one obtains occupancy in heaven without a reference letter from the world's dispossessed. God's reign does not belong to the racist, to the sexist, to the homophobic, to the classist, not to the xenophobic, despite what public profession of faith they may or may not have made. The promises of God are neither for the oppressor not for those complicit in oppression, regardless of how 'churchy' they may be or which commandments they selectively keep. Believing in Jesus is never sufficient, for even the demons believe and tremble at his name." Burying White Privilege
- Miguel de la Torre

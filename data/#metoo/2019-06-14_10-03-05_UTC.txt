As a previous 7 habits facilitator in Asia I found this quote to be confronting for many of my students including myself. For that reason it’s also one of my favourites because it holds me to account, it forces me to change my patterns it pushes me to step outside my territory. Keep this on a post it on your laptop or perhaps in the bathroom. It’s a great reminder for “what did you do today that got you uncomfortable? that got you scared?” Everything you want is on the the other side of fear says Jack Canfield. you see it’s about the ability to keep moving while you’re afraid.

LðŸ‘€k what arrived yesterday! So excited to dive into this one! Iâ€™ve loved @jenniferweinerwrites since LITTLE EARTHQUAKES (2005), which we read in my â€˜New Moms Book Club.â€™ ðŸŒ¸Now, MRS. EVERYTHING (@atriabooks June 11) is maybe her best book yet...strides women have made since the 1950s...free love, #Woodstock, â€˜properâ€™ wife...70 years of American history. Trust me, this is going to be a BIG book for the summer of 2019. 
So, so grateful for this early copy!! âœ¨www.leslielindsay.com|Always with a Bookâœ¨

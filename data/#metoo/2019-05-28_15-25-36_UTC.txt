‼️ Let’s talk Menstruation, shall we??!‼️ Join the discussion on menstruation taboos and stigma WORLDWIDE.

Not only are they silenced, but they lack the dedicated, integrated services they need to lead a healthy life. Meet our community partner, CouldYou? who not only distribute menstruation cups to marginalized girls/women around the world but actively seek to break the stigma surrounding menstruation. Together, we can ensure a healthy society. Visit our Facebook page to RSVP for this FREE event! •

.
And so, my Birthday Month ends.
.
Thank you, everyone, for the protracted month-long (and more) celebrations.
I have a few other pictures coming up, but I am pictured here, on the day of my birthday, at a surprise office celebration;
dwarfed by two giant lily bouquets.
.
I have been very open about having mixed emotions about celebrating this one:
my birthday (more or less) coincides with the 1-year anniversary of my almost successfully killing myself after surviving a series of very traumatic sexual assaults.
.
The last few days have been exceptionally rough.
I have had to face my aggressor in close proximity at a salsa event over the weekend.
.
.
And I have had to accept the very possible reality that salsa will never truly be a safe space for me because he will keep getting hired to DJ at these events.
.
.
As a result, I have had to ask myself:
How much do I love this dance; and is the price that I am paying in my emotional wellbeing worth it?
.
.
I still don't have the answer.
.
.
Happy Birthday, Me. ðŸŽ‚

I cleaned my entire room. Well... I couldn’t get him out of my head so I cleaned and cleaned until I reached the very back corner of my closet. About a week after it happened, I took all the clothes that he had stripped off of my body and shoved them in the purse that he had taken from my hands, right next to the bottle full of vodka he had told me to bring and drink all of. Right next to the torn condom wrapper and the one next to it that lay still untouched. Right next to the bottle that used to hold the schnapps that he convinced me to chug. I found that purse in the back of my closet. I stopped cleaning. I remembered why my closet was a mess. I can’t think about what happened to me if I put up a paper thin partition of pretty clothes. If I hide the evidence away then I never have to face it. If I don’t break down this wall in my mind, then I don’t have to see what lies behind it. I don’t know if I can. -

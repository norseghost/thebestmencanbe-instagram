This evening Nobel Peace Prize Laureate @nadia_murad_taha will headline the JLDH event and will be joined by Baroness Emma Nicholson along with victims of sexual violence. 
Containing personal speeches from victims of sexual violence in conflict, parliamentarians and campaigners, this event will bring together all those concerned into a discussion about how we can build on the steps taken to end it for good.

The evening will conclude with the unveiling of a specially commissioned statue by sculpture artist @rebeccahawkinssculpture to commemorate victims of sexual violence - Here you can see the final preparations, installing the sculpture at the venue!

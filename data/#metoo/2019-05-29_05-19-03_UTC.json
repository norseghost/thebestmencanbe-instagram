                        "text": "I have a good man in my life. This doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s perfect or that we don\u2019t come to blows over ridiculous & inconsequential shit. It doesn\u2019t mean our marriage hasn\u2019t weathered epic storms & near fatal crashes. He\u2019s a good man in my eyes because he\u2019s committed to profound, earth-shattering growth - his own & ours in partnership. He\u2019s a hard-working, aware participant in his conscious evolution. We\u2019re both stubborn AF but he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s always right & he\u2019s better at saying sorry than I am when he\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s still learning what it authentically means to be a man & what it is to embody the masculine in a post-feminist, #metoo climate - figuring out how to honour his own needs whilst acknowledging the needs of women like me, his daughter, his female colleagues. He doesn\u2019t dismiss the pain, trauma and grief of the feminine - he understands why it exists & how much of it has to do with the masculine. He acknowledges that at times he\u2019s unconsciously been a part of the problem but now knows he\u2019s part of the solution. He\u2019s an accomplished leader - of himself, of others & of this family. I trust him to make the right decisions. I can trust him to honour my wisdom & intuition and the choices I make - sometimes without even fully knowing how I make them. From the 7th to the 10th he\u2019s off to the 2019 Sydney National Men\u2019s Gathering with a bunch of other beautiful, brave blokes who aren\u2019t afraid to get balls-deep in the soup of their own personal shit instead of hiding from it or pretending everything - society, our systems, the planet - is hunky dory when it\u2019s clearly fucking not. 2 weeks after that he\u2019ll be at a meditation retreat. He\u2019s working to not repeat the sins of the fathers & grandfathers who stumbled along before him. He\u2019s committed to learning, to brutal self-examination, course-correction, unfoldment & healing. I feel challenged, honoured, held, given space, seen, supported and loved.  So here\u2019s to you @chris_zumwalt, here\u2019s to the men like you who are stepping into, & embodying their masculine with grace & strength and who aren\u2019t afraid to embrace the feminine - in others & in themselves. #divinemasculine #divinefeminine #balance #goodmen #yinyang"

✨SUPPORTING A SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE✨ 
The first time someone disclosed their sexual abuse to me, I had no idea how to respond. It was scary, and emotional. I wanted to be supportive but I didn’t know how. So for those of us who are still figuring out how to best support those who have experienced sexual violence, here are some quick & easy Do’s and Dont’s of supporting survivors. ✨DO✨
✅Validate their experience - “I believe you”.
✅Tell them that it isn’t their fault & they did nothing to deserve it.
✅Ask how you can be supportive.
✅Remind them that you care about them.
✅LISTEN.
✅Respect their boundaries (ex: ask before hugging)
✅Give them total control of the conversation (how much they share, how long the convo is etc).
✅Reach out for support - you don’t have to support them alone, you may need support too.
✨DON’T✨
❌Define their experience for them - some people do not feel that the words r*pe, sexual assault etc describe their experience for them. Do not force them to use those words.
❌Question them - you’re not an investigator, so don’t act like one. ❌Doubt them - this can cause such further trauma and damage.
❌Minimize their experience - no “at least ___ didn’t happen”. Violence is violence, trauma is trauma. This isn’t a competition. ❌Push them to report - It’s important that you allow the survivor FULL control over how they cope. They’re coping with how the lost control of their body, so don’t take away their control over how they cope with it. ❌Share their story without permission.
❌Act like a pro - it’s ok if you’re not.
❌Give unsolicited advice or opinions.
✨Remember: you can only support someone else if you’re taking care of yourself too. If these conversations aren’t possible for you that’s ok, tell the person that you believe and support them and ask if it’s ok that together you find someone who can give them the support you can’t.

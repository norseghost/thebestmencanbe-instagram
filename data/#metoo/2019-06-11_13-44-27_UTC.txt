ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰ðŸ’ŠTHE HYSTERIA STIGMA ðŸ§  ðŸ’Š 
The word hysteria meant WOMB in ancient Greece, women who thought to have a womb defect were hysterical. Why on earth do we get stigmatized for being "hysterical"? Chronic illnesses, abandonment issues, mental health issues etc can truly break our nervous system, literally! Do not let anyone tell you you're crazy! A prayer for all those "hysterical" women who came before us and went through so much pain and isolation.

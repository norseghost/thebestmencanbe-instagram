This is my story🙏  When I was 10 years old living in the states, a neighbor twice my age took advantage of my innocence and youth and changed my life forever.  That experience and my silence defined my childhood and wrote on the slate of who I am today.  It affected myself worth, my relationship with men and my relationship with myself.  To survive I taught myself how to deny the pain and smile through it.
Recording this song was a therapeutic moment for me, because that’s when it became clear that I can’t turn back time and change the past but I can speak up and unleash the burden I’ve carried for years, and free the girl in me, from the shame she internalized!
Today I urge you, if you’ve ever been hurt or taking advantage of by anyone.  Don’t hold it in, ask for help, reach out for a friend, a parent a counselor or anyone with ears.  SPEAK UP, don’t wait for years like me, because that’s the only way we can start to heal!

I would like to thank the 21 beautiful ladies that helped me tell my story in a profound and  precise manner♥
A big thank you to Adi Hayat for producing this song with care and editing the video with love🎶

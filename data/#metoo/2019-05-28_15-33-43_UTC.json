                        "text": "We often cling to past pains because we don\u2019t feel fully witnessed. We keep returning unconsciously to the same experiences of wounding, not fully understanding why the same pain keeps getting recreated. We don\u2019t feel like we can move on into a better world if no one understands what we\u2019ve been through. We get so obsessed with the story of how it\u2019s been, rather than focusing on how it IS & how it can be. \u2063\n\u2063\nFor years I was this way \u2014 waiting for people to fully \u201cget\u201d me before I started truly living. The burden of my past traumas felt insurmountable. Until finally I took the same relentless optimism & militant self-protection that had kept me alive thus far and channeled it into not just surviving but actually living a life beyond my wildest dreams. Until finally I decided to stop externally seeking & to instead internally validate myself, through deep subconscious reprogramming. And then suddenly the world started to validate me too (it\u2019s almost like we live in a vibrational universe where the external mirrors the internal! \ud83d\ude0d) Turns out, I had more love than I even realized - when you\u2019re running a \u201cno one gets me\u201d program, you can\u2019t even see the connection right in front of you.\u2063\n\u2063\nWhen I look at the explosive nature of online callouts these days, I see the legacy of our unexpressed rage and unwitnessed pain. I see all of us carrying so much we never said, so much that was not acknowledged, in our own lives and in our ancestors\u2019 lives too. And we finally have a bit of a social context for that expression and acknowledgement. So it\u2019s all coming out. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhich is ultimately a good thing, if we know how to ride the waves and seize the moment for the highest good. If we hold a vision beyond perpetual triggers, if we do stand strong & do not turn away from what is coming up, if we extend true compassion to all who are suffering. And yes, even those who you don\u2019t believe or you feel like could be a little nicer in how they\u2019re expressing themselves. \u2063\n\u2063\nWe have the opportunity to be time-traveling alchemists, embodying the frequency of the future in the present moment, and watching the world reorganize itself back to our birthright of peace and connection."

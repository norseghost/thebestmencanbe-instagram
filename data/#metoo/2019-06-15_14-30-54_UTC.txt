#iimunchampionship 
A Championship isn’t complete without Committee simulations that tickle your brain and give you the thrill! 
From discussing Indian Cinema’s contribution to India’s soft power to revisiting Pataliputra with the aid of Arthashastra, from discussing #MeToo to debating on the possibilities leading to the third world war, from ideating on bringing cricket to non-cricket playing nations to delegating in ‘Parliament of the World’s Religion’, we’ve got so much in store for you!

Our Mahabharata council Simulation last year created a storm when we launched it. It also went on to become the most loved, educative and successful council amongst all. This year, our Substance team along with our Academic Advisory Council has more than ten Committees and Agendas that have never been discussed and deliberated before. 
Join us in changing the course of what the world debates. Register to be a part of IIMUN Championship 2019- The Independence Day Edition.

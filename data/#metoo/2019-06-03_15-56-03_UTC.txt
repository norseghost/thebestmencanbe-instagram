SORRY, THIS WALL WAS BORING ME... ☺️

Graffiti is considered vandalism in most countries. Because of the risk of being caught, the graf artists, or “writers”, have to create their art-pieces under enormous time pressure, but also - under increased adrenaline! 😂
.

More and more places around the world, however, are recognising graf as a legitimate art form and providing legal space for it. Melbourne, Warsaw, Prague, New York, Zurich and Copenhagen are some of them. .
.
On the other hand, we see new (cleaning) technologies being born around the (centuries-old) graffiti phenomena - for those  who do not approve of walls covered with graffiti art 🖼. .
.
On which side do you see yourself ? 🤔

Did you know that 81% of women who experience rape, stalking, or physical violence by an intimate partner report significant short- or long- term impact such as post traumatic stress disorder? More than 1 in 3 women report having experienced this in their lifetime. This is a huge burden on my heart. I'm one of those women. I survived, and I'm living to tell the story. I want every woman to know that there is life after #abusiverelationships.

I want you to also know, you are not alone. We are not alone! We can help each other. We can encourage each other. We can stand together and fight this! My dream is to see every woman, side-by-side, arm-in-arm, in battle against this universal epidemic. We won't be #silenced. We won't live #unspoken. We refuse to allow men or anyone to mistreat us anymore.

We are each a #warriorprincess. Adorned with jewels of every kind, covered in gold. We are daughters of the Most High King. And we are #ENTITLED to His #blessings and kingdom royalties. Jesus Christ already paid the price. He paid for it all. Then He cleaned us up, and dressed us in beautiful robes, and #crowned us with His #righteousness.
.

Oh yes! Good things are going to happen. Because we are #victorious! Together, the world will know and we will be known!

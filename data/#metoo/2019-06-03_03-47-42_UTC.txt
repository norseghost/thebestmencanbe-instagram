In about 6 years, I havenâ€™t been as clueless as this Monday. Waking up with no rush to reach some place. No urgency to complete entire week and wait for Friday evenings. It is altogether a strange feeling when you give a child immense freedom that he/she isnâ€™t used to.

Ever since I decided to pursue as an MUA, I wanted to give my ðŸ’¯ to it. Balancing work and makeup had left me restless and overly consumed.

So to feed time to my inspiration, I left my 9 to 5 life. Fortunately, I have few paying works aligned to keep me sane. Saying â€˜yesâ€™ to makeup/shoot on Wednesday feels good. LOTS of new things coming up. Excited for all that life will offer me. 
Nervous, happy and content.

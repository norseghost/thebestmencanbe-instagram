Last week's post on women's safety in the US sparked discussion, so I thought I'd follow up.

A few years ago, I experienced a mind-shift that made me realize how I had wrongly questioned sexual assault survivors in the past.

The negative way the media and news portrays people who speak out against sexual violence influences/reinforces how our culture behaves, and it's trashcan-fire worthy.

While I take full responsibility for my behavior, I know better now - and #whenyouknow, you can speak out and spread the truth.

If you don't understand the motives behind #BelieveSurvivors and #MeToo movements, maybe this chart will inform & shift your thinking.

Happy Monday ‚ù§Ô∏è My heart goes out to all my Levesque family.  If you need something message me, call me or hit me up anyway you know how.  I will be home this afternoon.

So I love all the new faces üòÅ
Makes me extremely happy, and gets me distracted all at the same time. 
My main focus is making sure that no veteran ever has to deal with this kind of housing issue again. 
People shouldn't be dishonest. üò°
You can tell me all day, that's how people are.
I CALL BULLSHIT!
The only reason people do this kind of stuff is because no one stands up. 
I'm not ashamed.
I'm not embarrassed to be on here sharing.

I think people should be honest.
I think people should be good.
I think people should leave this place better than they found it.

I totally believe that most people agree with me.

No one should be taking advantage of people in order to do what???? Make money. 
Disgusting.

Everyday I get further, and am slowly realizing my place.  My loud mouth was meant to speak up.

Have a great Monday.
Don't forget I start my new job so I will see you all on the flip side of that and if I am not responding for 6+ hours that is why... Love all your faces always ‚ù§Ô∏èA.Levesque

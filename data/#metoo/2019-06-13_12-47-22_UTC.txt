Last night on my terrace in Williamsburg, NYC. I’m here to attend New York Times “New Rules Summit”. On equality, diversity and inclusion. Great speakers on stage and working groups on #metoo among other topics. You’ll find some of it in my story. 
It’s not about changing women. It’s about changing the rules. It’s time to write new rules!

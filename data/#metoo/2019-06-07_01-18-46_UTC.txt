Over the weekend I was lucky enough to take @nicholasforsterphoto to see @upsettingrapeculture ‘s Monument Quilt Display on the National mall. The quilt is a collection of over 3,000 stories of sexual assault survivors and their supporters. I’ve been a part of this amazing project since I interned in 2015 and it was surreal to see the quilt for the only time in history it will be shown in its entirety.

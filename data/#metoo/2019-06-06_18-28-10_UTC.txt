New video alert‼️ Link in bio🙏🏽 Another indictment surrounds R. Kelly but this one was filed on his former manager who allegedly threatened Joycelyn Savage’s father Tim’s life. R. Kelly was also back in court today to answer to the additional 11 indictments that he’s been charged with. Of course, he pleaded not guilty. Radaronline posted a story today that he’s trying to pull together cash to leave the country. I’m sure if he could have he’d have been gone. This is a fkn mess. 🙏🏽💙💫

[Content warning: image text describes sexual assault] Starting out the first few days of the #sac5050 challenge with some fast gouache portrait minis - doing one portrait a day with a full teaching schedule this summer already feels bananas, but really trying to do justice to the portaits and #metoo stories of my volunteers ❤❤❤❤ ALSO: I haven't reached 50 volunteers yet, so if you're interested in sharing a selfie and story for this project, DM me both! 🙏💖

This is an historic decision. Credit goes to @meesha.shafi for bringing this change in the erstwhile  flawed law. Now, the case of the alleged sexual harrasser Ali Zafar really doesn't matter because Meesha has already won a huge big battle. Bravo, Meesha.
And there are women like Frieha Altaf and Unilever Shazia Syed-- the former launched #meinbhi , the local version of #metoo movement, and the latter supported and gave the platform of LSA2018 to Meinbhi - - who shamelessly remain adamant to support and work with the alleged sexual harraser. They are trying to run with hare and hunt with the hounds. I challenge Unilever to show us one such example in any other country where a big corporation continues to work with an alleged sexual harrasser after public surfacing of allegations.

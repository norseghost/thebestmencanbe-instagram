The next Pinay we want you to meet is Melissa. @balafett

She's a 1st generation Filipinx-American, carved from a diaspora that planted its roots in Brooklyn and Spring Valley. She is an educator, reader, and writer. If hearts could burst out of chests to dance, hers would wine to dancehall music and then bachata all night long til its body turned to dust. 
Being a Raised Pinay is about remembering the magic within ourselves, our sisterhood, and our roots; that "Island Woman Rise" because we dripping in gold, alchemized by the fire we hold, burning within our own bellies.

Witness her magic and the that of the other sisters on June 28 & 29. Tickets on sale now at raisedpinay.com

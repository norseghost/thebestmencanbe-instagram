Rape culture ends with prevention education. In our current social climate, where rape myths have a bigger voice than survivors, it is estimated that every 98 seconds a sexual assault happens. One in three women and one in six men experience some form of sexual violence in their lifetime, those who identify as transgender or bisexual face the highest rates of sexual violence, and every 8 minutes a claim of child sexual violence is substantiated. By investing in prevention education, you can help change these statistics. I have no doubt that together we can end rape culture.

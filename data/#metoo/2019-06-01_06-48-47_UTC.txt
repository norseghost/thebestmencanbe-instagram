People will keep on bringing you down and destroy you. That’s the thing about life, you just have to deal with it. But the way you face and handle their cruelty says a lot about you. Isn’t it scary how people can judge easily about something they don’t really know? How they can react instantly without thinking? How, even if they know how good the person is, they can still change their minds?
I guess the old saying “Kindness is a chain reaction” doesn’t apply anymore in this century. I can’t count on my fingers the number of people who made me realizes that no matter how kind you are to them, they can still turn their backs on you and betray you just because of rumors and hearsay.Hearing rumors about me made me depressed before but when I started to understand and accept the fact that I can’t please everyone, everything changed. It’s all in the mind. It’s all in your perspective.They are the people worth keeping. They are the people you will need. When people throw you rocks so you will stop from shining, kill them with kindness. Kill them in silence. Not reacting on everything they say about you doesn’t mean weakness but rather it shows intelligence and strength. It means you are smart enough to ignore things that will not help you grow.
While people are busy making rumors, become busy too in making yourself the best version you can be. By the end of the day, they will get nothing in return but waste of their time. By the end of the day, you’re the real MVP for proving them wrong. By the end of the day, you’re the happy one and that’s what really matters.
Adopt everything that will help you grow and develop, release everything that will stop you from being the person He plans you to be. You’re a work of art. You are unique. Don’t let people change that. ***

The stress and sadness that a toxic relationship causes you IS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH - body, mind, heart and spirit. Sadness, anger, frustration, heart break, disappointment, anxiety, trauma, loneliness, shame, feeling used - if these negative emotions go unchecked and unhealed over a prolonged period of time - they land in the body as ILLNESS. Did you know that research shows that an inordinate amount of domestic violence victims end up with breast cancer?? Emotional and mental pain = physical sickness. STRESS QUITE LITERALLY KILLS. It is not worth your health, my love. Let it go. Find a way out. Ask God/Universe for courage and strength to leave the toxic situation. You can be happy. You can be healthy. You can live in peace. You deserve that. Save yourself. Free yourself. Heal yourself. Heal your life. You have the power.

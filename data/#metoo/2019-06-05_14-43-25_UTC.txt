Happy Global Running Day!! We are getting very excited for the @metrohealthcle Resiliency Run! Join us Saturday, June 22 at 9am for a 5k or 1 mike walk. Itâ€™s amazing to be able to run alongside people who saved our lives. Proceeds from the race help provide essential care to those who come to MetroHealth for various types of trauma.

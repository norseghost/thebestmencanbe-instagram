                        "text": "I was not going nuts about Trading Paint, but when I saw the critic responses to the film I was surprised at the cynical nature of people these days.  4.5 from the people and 3.5 from the critics.  Ouch!  John Travolta is the lead and The Doors Michael Madsen as Linsky is in the film as well.  Travolta plays an aging hot rodding daddy with a son who decides to \u2018shift\u2019 over to Madsen\u2019s crew who is an enemy of his fathers on the race track.  Travolta\u2019s Sam Monroe and Madsen\u2019s Linsky should have had a fist fight like at the bar, I would have preferred Linsky to have won the fight!  Linsky was certainly more \u2018manly\u2019 than Travolta who is on the line about being a man.  Not like he isn\u2019t a Democrat!  In the Trump Era one should at least be a bit tougher as things are not as they appear to be.  At any rate Travolta\u2019s son in the picture is another pouty 3rd grader this guy is like 29 with a woman at home and the kid, that sort of thing, he\u2019s a loser and blames his old man, who shows the \u2018boy\u2019 where it\u2019s at.  Travolta should have let him have it!  Instead the whole thing goes on about that dim bulb four lettered word \u2018love\u2019. So I can see where fans got upset that Travolta ends up not the winner but on the crew.  Still the film isn\u2019t THAT BAD it\u2019s just a homey type \u2018cracker\u2019 film that is perhaps not a #metoo fan!  But I think that Americans that are outside of the media (Nationalists) might find some good things here, it\u2019s hard to find anything without being insulted because you voted for Trump and not Hillary!  We can\u2019t very well \u2018beat up\u2019 people like we used to!  Remember the Dead Zone?\n\n6.3 Out Of 10\n\nAlthough I can\u2019t recommend (7.0/10) Trading Paint it was good to see Madsen and Travolta only that there should have been some fights and maybe the son might need to get shot, but in the leg, that kind of action would surely have been warranted.  I mean if you were still talking America, and not this THING that is going around!\n\n#CLAYSMOVIEREVIEWS #movie #movies #film #films\n#cinema #instamovie #instamovies\n#moviefan #moviereview #review\n#critic #filmcritic #critical #moviecritic\n#rated #cinema #reviews #moviereviews\n#TRADINGPAINT #JOHNTRAVOLTA #MICHAEL"

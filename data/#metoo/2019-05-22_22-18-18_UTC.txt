#Repost @princedonnell ・・・ I was VERY GUILTY of this at one point on my life and I started working on it by unfollowing almost everyone! And doing a detox! They still show up in my explore page but I gotta CURVE EM!! Lol. Fellas, we gotta do better and elevate our QUEENS by tailoring our ATTENTION on what’s RESPECTABLE & WHAT’S NOT! If you wouldn’t want your lady posting inappropriate photos, don’t like or support it. THAT GOES FOR ME TOO! We gotta start unfollowing temptations that lead us astray! When we as men stop supporting what’s FAKE & UNHEALTHY, it’ll dead that wave! When we start focusing our attention by publicly liking, commenting and reposting the women who are out here believing in God, starting businesses, getting their degrees and not posting ass pics every 5 minutes of the day, it’ll become the “new cool.” Everybody won’t like this post but it’s the truth! We gotta do better fellas! Let’s support the Queens who are setting a great example for the next generation of Queens who will be our daughters & nieces! It starts with us and how we lead 💯🙏🏽 #thepastorofbusiness #lifelessons

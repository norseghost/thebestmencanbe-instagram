Call for Entries- Womenâ€™s Stories (Untold) - Text and Image - enter by June 15 - Many women have a different story, though, the nature of each story is founded in similarity, women being tired of having to carry the secrets of their stories. Instead, courageously deciding to share their stories with the world. This exhibition seeks to give a voice to those who have survived the trauma of tragedy. Whether feeling marginalized, treated unequally, being simply ignored and overlooked, harassed, physically assaulted, verbally abused, or have experienced profound loss. These stories should be told, stories of experience in a domestic setting or the workplace. Not only stories of dark experiences but the experiences of triumph and strength. The exhibition will consist of photographic imagery and/or words. Both photographs and text pieces will be printed and exhibited on the gallery walls. The stories shared can range from subtle expressions to bold statements, of your own experience or of someone you know who has experienced such tragedy. The gallery space acts as a platform for women to use their voices through images and text in an act of healing and strength. Artists names can be kept confidential upon request.

So often we become so comfortable in our own hometowns that we forget to stay alert. This is apparent with outdoor sport enthusiasts quite often. Headphones, playing with your phone...it’s easy to become complacent and unaware of your surroundings. Remember even the “safest” areas can make you a victim. Always be prepared no matter where you are. **I did not mention paying attention to time of day/lack of lighting and that in this particular area, the best place to retreat is the closest house in the neighborhood IF POSSIBLE.

A clip of my message about the thorn in the flesh. We all have a thorn in the flesh that reminds us how frailty we are as human beings and that no matter how beautiful we are on the outside, no matter how much money we have, no matter how intelligent we are, and no matter how successful we are, there will always be that thorn in the flesh that keeps us humble. There are certain things that weâ€™ve dealt with in the past or may be dealing with currently behind the scenes, behind closed doors, and behind The Mask that only God knows about. It is that very thorn in the flesh that draws us closer to God, that keeps us praying and depending on him. #BehindTheMask #MeToo #SexualAbuseSurvivor

Summer lovin' 
After a night of no sleep suffering a huge anxiety attack and PTSD overload I am not feeling as fresh as this picture makes me seem. I know it's said over and over, but just because people are smiling on the outside, it doesn't mean they're not suffering inside

I've got such a beautiful support network and I don't know what I'd do without them. Life on life's terms is hard, but with them I know I've got the world at my feet

Recovery is different for everyone, but everyone has hard times, I respect anyone who's working on themselves to get better

Love you guys ❤️ #recovery #mentalhealth #ptsd #anxiety #bpd #metoo #igotthis #mentalhealthistrending #ootd #igers #unicornhair #hair #dress #summer #smile

Intergalactic Joke
I’ll tell you joke of the intergalactic kind,
a joke that’s exclusive and true to this rhyme. 
We choose to forget why we come to this place, 
but we all have a message and a truth to embrace. 
The tea has been laced with the lies you’ve been taught, 
but now the page turns towards the truth that you’ve sought. 
So let’s start with a knock,
“Hello who’s at the door?” “It’s the man with the hearse! 
Would you die or live more?” I laugh at the notion and I give him a wink, 
for the truth you’ve been seeking can’t die it just sinks. -mantra_matt.

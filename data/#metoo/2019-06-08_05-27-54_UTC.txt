By order of the government of the State of #Missouri, a woman seeking to have an abortion in the state now must undergo an invasive and medically unnecessary vaginal examination… for some reason. 
And by the way, the last abortion clinic in the state is on the verge of being forced to close, pending a court ruling — which would make it the first state in generations to be without such a facility.
Women of #America: 
Are you okay with being a second-class citizen, denied the RIGHT to make decisions about your own body? 
Women of America who vote #Republican: 
WTF is wrong with you???!!!
—
Don’t forget…
WE THE PEOPLE have the power. 
WE can #VOTE to end all of this vile insanity and restore normalcy. 
Our country was fooled once. 
In 2020, more than ever, voters will want substance. #Trump will come up empty there. People want candidates who can deal with real issues… not those only capable of creating fake emergencies… The 2018 midterms were a step in the right direction… now we need the #WhiteHouse and Senate in 2020... To save #America we must hold to account the inept, corrupt and amoral unindicted co-conspirator in the oval office, #Individual1: #illegitimate #failingpresident #DonaldTrump.

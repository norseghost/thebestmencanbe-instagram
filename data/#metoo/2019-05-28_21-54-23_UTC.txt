Cardi B glamorizes serial killer Aileen Wuornos for her new single cover, ‘Press’. ⁣
⁣
Aileen killed 7 men, shooting them point blank multiple times. ⁣
⁣
Cardi B admitted on camera that she drugged men & stole from them. She says she did this to ‘survive’. ⁣
⁣
If a Black male rapper glamorized Iqbal, Filho, Dahmer, Garavito, Tkack, Little, The West’s, Popkov or Bundy there would be outrage, boycott, sponsors dropping said artist then followed by an apology. ⁣

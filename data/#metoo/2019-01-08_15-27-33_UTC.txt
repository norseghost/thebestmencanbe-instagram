I uploaded this picture a year ago, and took it down after three days. Three guesses why. I had perverts sending me DM’s on Instagram. Three guesses about what. I recently realized that taking it down meant that I succumbed. Succumbed to the patriarchy. Albeit my cleavage is prominent, that is not the reason I uploaded the picture. Millions of women that show skin are raped every day, and led to believe that it was their skin show that instigated the man, or worse men, from committing such a heinous crime. It’s time to stop telling women how to dress. It’s time to stop telling women to refrain from publicizing such, “provocative” pictures. It’s time to start telling men to suppress their animalistic urges. It’s time for men to acknowledge that a woman could be exposing her body for her own self-esteem and pride; not for attention.

Like I wrote in my previous poem:

Do not tell 
your daughter
to dress
appropriately 
so that men 
do not leer 
at her. 
You are 
teaching
her that
men control
everything,
including a
body that 
is not theirs.

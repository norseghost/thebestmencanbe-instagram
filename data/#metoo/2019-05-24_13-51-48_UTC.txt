Oh I didn’t know you needed a permit to own a uterus. Or that you couldn’t bring your uterus to government buildings like courthouses. Or bring your uterus to public gatherings in some states. Or that some uterus’s are straight up outlawed. Or that you have to keep your uterus locked away in a government approved safe in California. Or that businesses are allowed to ban uterus’s on their premises. Or that uterus’s are banned on campuses. Or that... I can go all fucking day with this. I support you if you want to fight for what you think is a right. But don’t be a fucking retard @marchforthemovement

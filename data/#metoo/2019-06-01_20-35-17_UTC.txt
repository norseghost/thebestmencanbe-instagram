This is a TRUE story. It is MY story.

LOGLINE: A teen girl enters young womanhood, from an excessively traumatic home life. Through everything, she chooses to remain on a positive path as an adult. However, her naivete often blocks her journey by the decisions she makes and the people she unwittingly trusts.

The series will cover 30 years and have flashbacks in each episode from Sadrine's childhood and teen years.

I am sharing very personal details of my life with the intent of helping as many people as possible realize their worth and potential, and for them not to let negative people and experiences from their past reflect on how they move forward with their lives.

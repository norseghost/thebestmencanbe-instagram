It wasn't my choice for someone to physically attack me for the colour of my skin.

Its not my choice to be judged for the colour of my skin

It wasn't my choice to be born to the family I have.

It wasn't my choice to be raised in this country

But

It was my choice to overcome any negativity and be thankful for every blessed part of my story to achieve the best now and yet to come... For ever grateful  for the good, the bad, the ugly and the absolutely lovely. 
Always choose love

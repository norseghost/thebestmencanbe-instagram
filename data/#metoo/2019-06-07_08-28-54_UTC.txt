“I had taken a pill on a night out and not reacted well. Blacked out completely and was literally carried home by my flatmates. They went back out and asked one of my close guy mates to check on me when he got back from his night out. I was still completely fucked and only semi-conscious and he began undressing me and then raped me, even though I’d said no when he’d tried a couple nights ago. He then never spoke to me again, and I was devastated until I came to terms with what he’d actually done to me.”

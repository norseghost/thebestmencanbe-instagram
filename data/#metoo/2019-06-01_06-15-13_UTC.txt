Reposted from @arabian.jasmine.flower - “You’re speechless, I see... a fine quality in a wife.” 🐍 Songwriters @pasekandpaul took inspiration from this line in the original animated movie in order to write Princess Jasmine’s @naomigscott new solo song for the live action film, titled ‘Speechless’. Naomi, in her interview for The Telegraph Magazine, says ‘It’s her [Jasmine] saying, “I won’t be silenced.” It’s very timely. She might not win the battle, but she is singing for all those who come after her, in the same way women speaking out as part of #MeToo [are]. It’s not fun for them… There’s nothing to gain for them, whatever some might say. They’re thinking, “I am doing this for my girls, for that 15-year-old actress coming up.”’ 👏🏽 I am so excited for the depth Naomi is bringing to Jasmine in the live action! This is such a powerful statement, especially coming from a woman of colour on screen 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 Bring on seeing the movie in just 3 DAYS!!! 😮😍 (FYI, the animated scene used for this comparison is NOT the scene in which the line is said... it’s said during the scene where Jafar is arrested. But this comparison was just too good to pass up!) ✨ | #aladdin #aladdinliveaction #naomiscott #speechless #princessjasmine #jasmine #metoo #empowerment #diversity #inclusion #representation #feminism #disney #disneyprincess #pasekandpaul #alanmenken  #guyritchie #marwankenzari ✨ - #regrann

When I was in 5th grade, a boy on the bus said I reminded him of a porn star who used her hoop earrings to hold her ankles during sex. In 6th grade, a boy I babysat tried repeatedly to tug down my shirt “to see your boobies.” In 10th grade, an SUV full of boys shouted at me for several minutes and followed me, slowing their car to my pace as I jogged through my neighborhood. When I was 18, I went to a club for the first time, and an older guy with a beer and a beard licked my face. That same year an ex called and emailed me repeatedly to tell me how much he missed me and how all his friends agreed with him that I was a huge bitch. At a party in college, a guy grabbed my ass and then apologized to my boyfriend. After I graduated, I had dinner with a professor in his 70s to ask him about graduate school; he got drunk and tried to kiss me. At my first job out of undergrad, a coworker in his thirties with a toddler and a pregnant wife texted me a lot after work and once asked about my trip to Croatia. When I told him I’d send him a photo from the trip (of the boat I’d traveled in), he said it better not be one of me in a bikini. I finally stopped replying to his texts after I didn’t need him as a reference anymore. After I’d been working full-time for a year, I was out at a bar when a drunk stranger cornered me and my friends. He told me I’d never experienced any hardship in my life because my daddy surely paid for everything. When I complained about it afterwards, a guy in our group told me to get over it. When I was 25, a stranger followed me on my walk to work through my neighborhood; he ogled me and wouldn’t leave me alone. I was scared all day in my office that he would come back. In graduate school, I emailed a professor to ask if he’d review the introduction I’d written to my thesis and suggested we meet to talk about it and/or hang out before I left town. He replied that though he was sure my “intentions were honorable,” his wife was uncomfortable with us meeting. He went out for a beer with a male student a few days later. #timesup .

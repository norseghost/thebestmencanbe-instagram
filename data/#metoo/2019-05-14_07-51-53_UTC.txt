Initially, when I wrote this book I had in mind to write a book that would help individuals get out of abusive relationships and escape the emotional and psychological strongholds abuse can have on a person's life. Hearing the feedback from many readers helped me to realize, that it wasn't meant to only help ladies and nor was it only for individuals in abusive relationships. ‚ù§

Identifying and understanding that strongholds can happen in ANY type of relationship. The KEY represents our mind, ears and heart. What have you allowed through the door of your life that has run ramped in your mind, ears and heart? "Planning Your Escape ...The KEY To Your Freedom" will help you give "It" the pink slip or the eviction notice. You're valuable and you deserve to live a happy and fulfilling life!!!

Rape is a bitter truth the world covers its eyes to. 
Guys the cause of rape isn't mini skirts or showing too much skin because women who wear abaya have been raped. Rape isn't the cause of drinking because sober people have been raped. 
Tell me during the past few days how many victims have you heard of? Many. Rape has increased by 35% because we still haven't found a penalty for it. Meanwhile kids whether as young as 3 months are being shamelessly raped. Before they learn their first words they're shown the dark side of the world. How many more cases does this world need to understand the ONLY one to blame for rape is the rapist and until we don't take strict action against it. Me you anyone could be next....

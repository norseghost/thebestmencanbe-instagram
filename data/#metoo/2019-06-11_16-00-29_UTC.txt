Last Friday was “Movie Night” at Santa Maria… 🎬 📺🍿We were thrilled to show BLINK for our clients at  Bonita House; and the highlight of the evening was having 🌟movie Director and Actor Courtney Glaude present for a Q&A session with the audience after the movie! BLINK, is a story of domestic abuse and human brokeness. Nailah Belle is the epitome of beauty and strength. She is known to be committed to her classroom, community, and marriage. Her husband Chris appears to be the perfect accessory to accompany what reveals to be her perfect lifestyle, however; all is not what it seems to be, as this riveting story unfolds; in just one Blink.  @blinkthemovie @courtneyglaude #mustwatch #indiefilm #raisingawarenessdomesticviolence #domesticviolence #metoo #blinkthemovie

                        "text": "On\u00a0McKagan's third solo album,\u00a0Tenderness, he turns towards gentle country-tinged songwriting, but his punk spirit emerges in the unexpected form of social consciousness. On the\u00a0Shooter Jennings-assisted album, most of the 11 songs center around political critique, social unrest, and even perspectives on gun violence, homelessness, and the #MeToo movement. The album followed a time that found\u00a0McKagan rejoining\u00a0Guns N' Roses\u00a0for the \"Not in This Lifetime\" world tour and writing his second book, entering his fifties as a sober family man and a lifetime away from the debauchery and recklessness of his early years. This maturity manifests throughout\u00a0Tenderness\u00a0in the form of sincere and well-crafted songwriting. The album opening title track slowly unfolds with melancholy piano chords and swells of pedal steel guitar.\u00a0McKagan, never a particularly stunning singer or lyricist, sounds confident and inspired here, playing to his strengths and shining in this slower, heartfelt ballad. On this song and many others, looking for hope in dark times emerges as one of the album's main themes. \"It's Not Too Late\" and \"Chip Away\" both look at divided American politics, \"Last September\" tells a story of retribution surrounding a sexual assault and \"Falling Down\" deals with opioid addiction, all set to swaying country-rock. Sad melodies are underpinned by rusty fiddle playing and steady rootsy arrangements, molding the songs into a hybrid of mellow rock and honky tonk.\u00a0Tenderness\u00a0is a nuanced and surprisingly well-balanced album, with only the heavy-handed gloom of \"Parkland\" (a well-intended but questionably executed song about school shootings) breaking up the flow. Older, wiser, and more concerned with the greater good than selfish excess,\u00a0Duff McKagan's punk edge hasn't left him, but instead has been refined into a loving world view that believes there's still a chance for humanity. This bright outlook combines nicely with some of the strongest and most disarming songwriting of\u00a0McKagan's winding career.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#therockandbluesreview #duffmckagan #shooterjennings #tenderness #gunsnroses #country #countryrock #honkytonk #america #anericana #punk #album #albumreview"

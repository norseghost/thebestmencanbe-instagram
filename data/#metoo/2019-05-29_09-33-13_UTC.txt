DAY 29- Photographing or recording sex acts without consent is IPSV. 
Image based abuse is sometimes called revenge porn but it isn't porn and it isn't always motivated by revenge. Power and control in relationships can also be a motivation. Queensland is a leader with legislation that makes it a crime to share or threaten to share a sexual image, recording or even photoshopped or deep fake image of a person without consent. 
Did you know the @eSafetyOffice is there to support people who have experienced image-based abuse, by providing reporting options, support & resources for victims, their family/ friends, & bystanders. #itstimetotalkaboutIPSV #imagebasedabuse #iba #revengeporn #sexualviolenceawareness #sexualassaultawareness #dvawareness #nomore #saam #startbybelieving #dvpreventionmonth #IPSV #changetheending #onlyyesmeansyes #consent #domesticviolencepreventionmonth #notnownotever #domesticviolenceawarenessmonth #metoo #respectmetoo

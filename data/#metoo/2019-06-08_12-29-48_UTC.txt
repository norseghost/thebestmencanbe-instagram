Beautiful painting for the beautiful @kamrie87 I had a dream a few nights ago that highlighted her calling to help others who have struggled in the areas she’s struggled in. People who know similar pain. The bridge symbolizes each of our histories, when there was something that could kill us but we didn’t let it. We didn’t jump. This painting is for those who have survived. Who lived, and tell their stories fearlessly. .

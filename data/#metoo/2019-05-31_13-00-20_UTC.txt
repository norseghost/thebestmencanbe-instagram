How to Be a Woman in a Manâ€™s World (4/6)

After talking to many of my female colleagues and friends, I discovered that this is an issue that most of them have faced: Being approached from a professional context in which there was never any really fully developed personal relationship of any sort, but where there was friendly discourse and mutual friends and colleagues. This can leave many in a position where the professional lines can be blurred. But therein lies the problem, how could I navigate a situation where nothing was directly said but instances that led me to feel uneasy. I have been socialized as a woman in today's society to accept certain interactions and behaviours as borderline acceptable when they are in fact not acceptable. Conversely, men have been socialized to interact and behave in certain ways that can have a negative impact on women.

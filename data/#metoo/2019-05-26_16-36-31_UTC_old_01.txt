The Carnival of Venice was started from a victory of the Venice Republic against the Patriarch of Aquileia, Ulrico di Treven in the year 1162. To honor this victory, the people started to gather and dance in San Marco Square. This festival became official in the Renaissance as a way to save the prestigious image of Venice in the world and to protect Venetians from present and future anguish. However, under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor and later Emperor of Austria, Francis II, the festival was outlawed entirely in 1797 and the use of masks became strictly forbidden. After a long absence, the Carnival returned in 1979 to bring back the history and culture of Venice. ⭐️ Link in my bio.

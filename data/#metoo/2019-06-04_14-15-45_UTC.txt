Healing is a huge part of our wellbeing! Do you agree? ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
What exactly do I mean by that? ‚Å£‚Å£
Have you ever been through something traumatic, something that has stayed with you over the years, something that when you think about it still affects you and brings up an array of emotions that you wish you still didn‚Äôt feel. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Honestly I think everyone one of us have been though various experiences that have caused us pain, some more then others and some more severe and traumatic then others, but nevertheless, the experiences were real and sometimes we may even still relive them in our minds or in conversations, and even in dreams. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Some people say, hey it‚Äôs just part of life and are able to move on while others have a much harder time letting go. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
What is important is dealing with it and healing from it! Why? Because if we don‚Äôt we can never truly move on. It will linger and affect us in many ways, often subconsciously, until we really sit with it and deal with whatever emotions and consequences it has caused. ‚Å£‚Å£

It is hard work, I kid you not, but it is important work. I realize this more and more as I go through my own personal life as well as my life as mom, wife and entrepreneur. If I am not in the right headspace, the right state of mind, I am not able to function or deal with things happening in the moment in the best way. I get clouded and sometimes my buttons are pushed. Some of those buttons are from old wounds and emotions arise that have nothing to do with the current situation. Does any of this sound familiar?‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
It‚Äôs not the case all the time, I know, but often it is, and I just wanted to say that I believe it‚Äôs important to be mindful of where our thoughts, emotions and reactions are coming from. And also, that if there is something that keeps coming up for you, perhaps it‚Äôs time to give yourself the time and opportunity to work with, deal and heal from that experience, so that you can live a freer life, without the burden of that thing weighing you down. ‚Å£‚Å£

People heal in different ways. What I have found to help is therapy, talking to people I trust, and recently, I have found yoga and meditation.... Cont üëá

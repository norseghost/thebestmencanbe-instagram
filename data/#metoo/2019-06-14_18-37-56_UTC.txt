Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE Budweiser’s Father’s Day commercial honoring stepdads. I’m thrilled to see stepparents celebrated in the media, but I’m simultaneously blinded by rage knowing there will NEVER be an ad like this for stepmothers. Why does our culture embrace and lionize men who step up to parent their non-biological children as their own, but take offense when women do the same? Don’t tell me it’s because men are replacing estranged fathers. Over the past 13 years, countless strangers have put me in my place for referring to myself as a mother to my stepsons, and exactly none of them stopped to ask if my children’s other mother was alive, dead or MIA.

Like most things, there’s a double standard at play, and if we’ve learned anything from the #metoo movement, it’s that women must demand the change they want to see in the world. We must demand equality. Recognition. A seat at the table. A commercial in our honor.

Of the remaining 37% that are reported less than 10% are instances of false reporting. The facts are clear, and still the culture that would rather victims of sexually based crimes remain silent prevails.\nJoin Rebecca MacCeile as she throws off the shackles of silence and raises her voice. Turquoise Boot Straps: A Survivor\u2019s Thoughts provides a glimpse into her journey of self discovery while tackling many controversial topics at the height of the MeToo era.\n\nTo read more of Rebecca's thoughts on surviving and overcoming sexually based crimes you can find her latest release Turquoise Boot Straps: A Survivor's Thoughts on Amazon or by following the #linkinbio.

After watching the train wreck that was 2017\u2019s Beauty and the Beast remake - which was dull, lacked energy, and was completely miscast, I had remarked to my girlfriend after the screening that Guy Ritchie (or Baz Luhrmann, or Edgar Wright) should have made the movie. Then Guy Ritchie signed on to Aladdin, and already this project was looking promising. The first act up until after the fabulous \u201cNever Had a Friend Like Me\u201d, sequence unfolds and hums along at a brisk pace, frame for frame like the animated film, and I quite enjoyed it. It was after that though, as the movie started to add extra story, and the pace slowed way down, that it dawned on me: these Disney live action remakes are soulless and lack any imagination whatsoever. I mean, it was thrilling to see Guy Ritchie nail the big song and dance sequence to introduce Will Smith\u2019s Genie, but I couldn\u2019t help but imagine how it would\u2019ve played if the creators involved didn\u2019t have the 1992 animated film as a blueprint, and all of this was wholly original. From the songs, to the costumes, the VFX work and staging - it\u2019s a masterful sequence, but it still is just a complete carbon copy of the animated film. There\u2019s nothing original here. Even the film\u2019s attempts to beef up and femininize Naomi Scott\u2019s Jasmine, and give her new songs fall flat because all of these remakes have upped the #metoo and #timesup quotas of their female protagonists - so there\u2019s really nothing new to see. These remakes are essentially exact copies of their animated counterparts stuffed with an extra 30mins to beef up the arguably thinly written female parts. That\u2019s all they are. The music, the scenes, the story all unfold pretty much the same, so you\u2019re not surprised by anything here - all we the audience are doing is comparing these films to the beloved animated classics. When characters burst out into song and dance - it seems out of place. When Will Smith is giving it his all, but is merely redoing what Robin Williams did 27 years ago, and trying to be funny, it\u2019s mostly cringey. Naomi Scott is wonderful as Jasmine, and Mena Massoud mostly works as Aladdin, a"

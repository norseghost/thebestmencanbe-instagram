You have ruined this park for me. I know you'll never read this but it needs to be said. I walk to this park as often as I can because 1. It's a beautiful park and 2. It's about 5 miles round trip which is like the perfect morning walk for me. But you've absolutely ruined it for me. On my walks there I have to constantly tell myself "You'll NEVER see him again" and there's still a heavy chance I'll end up having an anxiety attack. I look at the driver of nearly every car the drives past. I have to play music because otherwise my mind goes to thinking about how absolutely terrified I am to see you. But it's true. I will NEVER see you again. You have never and will never own me. You can no longer control me or my actions. You can't convince me that bad things are completely normal anymore. Now when I think of you, I feel disgusted, ashamed, scared, and so unbelievably pissed off with you and myself. I've never felt more free, I've never felt more like my own person. Yes, you still cause me anxiety but you'll never, EVER control me again. I will continue to walk to the park, I will continue to take beautiful photos of the nature I see, and I will continue to grow as my own person.

what do all of these books have in common? overrated hedonist misogynists corrupting poetry with substance-addled drivel and saying it was inspired by postwar doldrums and radical ideas? male white supremacy and narcissism encapsulated in self indulgent brain vomit? reaching an iconic status posthumously wherein quotes and excerpts are shared everywhere by people glorifying them? and even taught in schools?

yes. but also not even close. 
the answer is rape culture & pedophile culture.

I’ve bought into it too, the patriarchy. I’ve spent a small fortune on books on every subject educating myself. most penned by men representing male worldviews. when I was developing as a person I found solace in the apparent rebellious counterculture spirit of beat-era poetry and related heavily to Alice bewildered by Wonderland. but I was in fact being influenced by and identifying with the characters and words of rape fantasists and abusers who’d have no respect for me as a woman teaching myself. I love the fearless, uncompromising hatred Andrea Dworkin had for Ginsberg, despite how revered he was. but I wonder why we’ve all heard of the pedophile but not the feminist who tried to expose him? ah yeah...media.

I want to get a blog soon as I write too much for a platform catering for small attention spans like mine 😂 but I detest social media and having a smartphone, I just use it when I’m unwell to help the time go by. too much of it. so I’m not expanding on this as passionately as I‘d like. but I wanted to stress I am on the warpath Aries-style to dismantle celebrity culture. people’s will to overlook the wrongs and defend the rights of people just because they’re wealthy, famous, attractive, or have created art etc. is something that terrifies me. I don’t understand the glamour. the obsession with television, fiction, film and anything or anyone endorsed by the matrix of mainstream media. like it’s more familiar and intimate to you than your own community. but how many famous people do you need to see (con)⬇️

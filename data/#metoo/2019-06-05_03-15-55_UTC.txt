How often do we hear someone say, “I feel sick to my stomach, I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders, or They are such a pain in my neck?” They are not just meaningless expressions. They stem from the fact that trauma and stress can build up in the body and cause psychosomatic symptoms such as stomach and body aches, migraines, or other physical ailments. In fact people who have experienced trauma are more likely to have a compromised immune system. And don’t forget, just because you may have symptoms resulting from trauma, it does not make the pain any less valid or real. lf. #trauma #traumaawareness #recovery #healing #supportsurvivors #empowersurvivors #believesurvivors #traumainformed #sexualassault #rape #abuse #resilience #metoo #metoomanyvoices #victim #survivor #psychosomatic #pain #support #courage #mentoo #mentalhealthawareness #healingjourney #survival #traumahealing #ptsdrecovery #ptsd #ptsdawareness #cptsd

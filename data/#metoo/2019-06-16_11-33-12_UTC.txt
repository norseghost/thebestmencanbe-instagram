On June 14th 2019 something earthshattering happened: alone in #Zurich more than 100'000 women (and men) went on the streets to protest inequalities in #switzerland  #frauenstreik2019 ♀️💪🏼♀️💪🏼 We were fighting for equal pay, fair distribution of care work, abortion rights, zero tolerance for domestic abuse and many more. The movement and support was huge. Needles to say: we were heard! 😏

Even the Financial Times wrote about #frauenstreik2019: "One of the world's richest states is giving half of its population a poor deal!" This needs to change now. Our patience is over.

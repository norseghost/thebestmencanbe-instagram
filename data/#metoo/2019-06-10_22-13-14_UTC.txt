🗝I received my first black eye from my abuser at age 15.🗝
..
I will never forget the emotions of that moment: confusion, shock, betrayal...then, shame. ..
Outwardly I was very prideful and reveled in the fact that I couldn’t be controlled - not even by his fists. Inwardly, I was ashamed with myself and truly believed something was wrong with me to make him passionate enough to hit me.
..
After that, his fists were not shy in “disciplining” me for my rebellion. It got worse. All the way through my early 20s, including when I was pregnant with my son, physical violence was a norm. ..
It got to the point that I no longer associated physical touch as an expression of love. I wouldn’t allow my boyfriend to touch me - I didn’t enjoy hugs...arms and hands were for defending myself and mouths were for yelling and screaming...
..
Today, physical touch is one of my top 2 love languages. I see my husband’s arms as a place of refuge and comfort, and the memories of my abuser and his fists are fading more each day.
..
If you are with someone who isn’t afraid to physically hurt you - who doesn’t respect and love you enough to never lay a harmful finger on you, then you are not with the right person. The right person for you will be reverent of the life within you and afraid to cause you pain.

Tonight, join us at 5:30 pm for VOW: Voices of Womxn Writers, a literary salon and networking event for women and womxn-identified writers, readers, and literary enthusiasts. Then, at 7pm, stay to see @eveensler read from THE APOLOGY, her new memoir, where she grapples with the sexual abuse she experienced as a child at the hands of her father.

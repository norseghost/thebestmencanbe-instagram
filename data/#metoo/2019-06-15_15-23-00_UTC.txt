@dalkeybookfestival surprises and delights every year. It’s impossible to get to all you want to hear, but I’ve got to the philosophy and social aspects of AI, Beyond #metoo, A former CIA boss’ iconoclastic take on Trump, and seeing Stephen Fry reading his mythological writings from a pulpit was truly a religious experience. Thank you #dalkeybookfestival !!

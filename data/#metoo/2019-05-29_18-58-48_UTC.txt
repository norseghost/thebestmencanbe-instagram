Motherhood in a concentration camp 2019.
Repost @animalrevenge “Gestation crates. They give pigs ZERO room to move. How would you feel if you didn't have enough room to stand up or move for years at a time? PLEASE STOP CONSUMING THESE PRECIOUS BEINGS. Consuming pork products directly pays for this to take place. Supply and demand - if there is no demand they will stop supplying this abuse. "Between 60 and 70 percent of sows are kept in crates during pregnancy in the United States. Each pregnancy lasts for three months, three weeks, and three days. Sows will have an average of 2.5 litters every year for two or three years, most of which is spent in the crates." Video via @vswolf”

Today 14th of June took place a historic and massive strike for women's rights in Switzerland, almost 30 years after the first one, demanding absolute equality, and absolute respect, because it's STILL not the norm here, nor anywhere else in the world.

Let this hopefully be the last time women have to strike for their rights, this shit is seriously getting old.

Ellen DeGeneres got very candid in a new interview about alleged sexual abuse she endured as a teenager. During an interview with David Letterman on the upcoming second season of Netflix’s My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, which premieres May 31, DeGeneres says her stepfather sexually assaulted her. “It’s a really horrible, horrible story and the only reason I’m actually going to go into detail about it is because I want other girls to not, you know, ever let someone do that,” DeGeneres tells Letterman during the episode.

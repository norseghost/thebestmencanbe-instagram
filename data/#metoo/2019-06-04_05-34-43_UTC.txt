If you're anything like me, you don't have everything figured out and life can be a mess. This sunday you have to come for this. I will share my heart with you and maybe we can make sense of the mess through my music. 🙆🏽‍♀️ Issa plan?

Let's meet on sunday 3pm sharp for some chilled jams and extreme vulnerability.

It's free my guys, so carry a friend or two or your whole squad 😊😊😊😊 Also have you listened to Rise Again? Link in my bio😁😁 #riseagain #endrapeculture #riseagainsurvivors #metoo #playkenyanmusic #playkemusic

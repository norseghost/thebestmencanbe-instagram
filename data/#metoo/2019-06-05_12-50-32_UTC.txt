I was so used to wearing a mask I didn’t know who I was…
.
I was well and truly lost…
.
For one person I had to be this way, for another I needed to be that way…
.
All I knew, was that I wasn’t good enough.

I hated every part of me.

From my big eyes to the bump in my nose…
.
The way my ribs would stick out, the shape of my boobs or my big hips…
.
That hourglass figure I couldn’t stand, because on me it just wasn’t right…
.
Why would any one want that?
.
I hated my voice, my legs, my feet and even my toes…
.
You get the picture…
.
I wasn’t thin enough, pretty enough, smart enough.

I just wasn’t enough.

I wasn’t any good as me… so I had to pretend to be someone else.

Putting on a mask every day to protect myself…from hurt, from rejection.

Pretending to be confident, when inside I felt like I wanted to die.

Acting as if I didn’t need to be liked, because in truth I was terrified that people wouldn’t like me anyway…
.
The problem with all that, is it becomes so hard to take the masks off, to show the real you.

Always being strong, always having my shit together, always pretending everything is ok so I would not be judged…or so no one would find out my secret.

I had no idea who I was…
.
I was lost.

And it was too vulnerable to allow anyone in… to show them the real me. The pain I hid. I would be judged. So I numbed it all. I hid anything vulnerable.

The thing with that is, to feel is to be vulnerable.

And by not being prepared to show my most authentic self, by seeing my vulnerability as a weakness, I was saying no to my emotions, to my feelings….I was saying no to being me.

The moment my life changed was the moment I decided to open up and begin to tell my story.

The moment I began to show the real me.

Every single part.

Because the truth is, through all the masks and the bullshit… if you don’t like the person you are when you lay down at night…
.
When you are alone…
.
When your mask has been removed…
.
Then what’s the point.
.
It starts with you, so strip it all back, show all of you, your most authentic self because that’s what’s beautiful.

No mask, no pretending.

That’s what the world needs.

Because that’s enough…
.
You my darling, are enough!

We live in a time where we're constantly bombarded with other people's opinions.

From the screens, billboards, ads, people we know, people we don't know.

I grew up being taught to do what I was told.Â  So I learned to always follow the opinions of others. 
I unconsciously surrounded myself with people who would control me. they were quick to give me their opinions. 
Let me tell you!!! That's no way to live YOUR life!

It was a monumental change when I began to take charge of what I needed to do for myself!!! Tell me something that has made a powerful change in your life.

**possible trigger warning **
Sadly, I was approached by a mom whose daughter had been assaulted. ðŸ˜žðŸ˜¡ aside from providing a shoulder I offered some pepper spray for her daughter who is obviously scared to leave her house.  I get SO angry hearing these stories #metoo#violenceagainstwomen#nomoreviolenceagainstwomen - I alps wish I could protect as many people as possible.  If these arenâ€™t your thing - I implore is all to become empowered and safer!!! I will meet/connect with whoever would like to hear more about the tools I have available, one on one or with a group.

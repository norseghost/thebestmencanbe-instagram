"The ‘dystopian’ department of HR isn’t interested in helping employees, it’s interested in just two things: stopping lawsuits and bad PR. Or at least, that’s the view that technology journalist Holly Brockwell shared in a Twitter rant that swiftly went viral, and was met with heavily divided opinions from other users."⠀
⠀
Unfortunately this is a view from many employees. This is why I will always bang the drum - HR people need to get proactive and prevent harassment in the first place DON'T just deal with the aftermath!⠀

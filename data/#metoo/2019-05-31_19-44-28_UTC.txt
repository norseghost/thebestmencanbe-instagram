YOU. ARE. ENOUGH. PERIOD. 
I once had an internship with a sports team and truly experienced what it felt like to be a woman in a ‚Äúman‚Äôs world‚Äù. My boss, someone who was supposed to be a mentor, a leader, straight up told me that I would never go far in the industry because of how well I did my job, but rather because of my looks. I was laughed at, talked about behind my back, and purposely set up to fail. It truly was one of the worst experiences of my life, but you know what? I am so damn thankful for it. That experience only added fuel to my fire üî• .
.
So to the people who laughed at me for having a dream and having the guts to go for it. Shame on you, but also, thank you. To the ones who said I was nothing and would never make it. Shame on you, but thank you. I am the smart, capable, confident, independent, resilient, strong, successful woman I am today, because I chose NOT to feed into your negativity. I chose to believe that I AM ENOUGH. And I always will be. .
.
So this is to the PEOPLE(men AND women) who have been told they aren‚Äôt good enough. That their dreams are stupid. That they won‚Äôt ever make it because of their sex, gender, race or whatever other bullshit reason someone will come up with. YOU ARE ENOUGH! And your dreams AREN‚ÄôT stupid. Use that as your fuel!!! But first, start by looking yourself in the mirror everyday and saying ‚ÄúI AM ENOUGH‚Äù. Because it all starts with YOU and whether or not YOU believe in yourself!

Happy Friday, my beautiful friends‚ù§Ô∏è

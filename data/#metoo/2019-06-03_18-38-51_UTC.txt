ICYMI: thousands of stories from survivors covered the National Mall this weekend as an act of solidarity, highlighting the experiences of some of the most marginalized communities in the movement to end #sexualviolence and #sexualassault. Major props to Baltimore-based org @upsettingrapeculture for coordinating this effort. #endrapeculture #youarenotalone #metoo #metoomovement

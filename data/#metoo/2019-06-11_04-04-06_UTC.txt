I watched the documentary named “Leaving Neverland”on Netflix. It’s about Michael Jackson’s sexual abuse for preteen kids. 
After full grown-up, finally, victims started to speak up about their tough experience. 
Part of them still love and adore MJ, and want to protect his public image as a good guy. Because too many people believing Michael’s superficial positive image, and actually a part of him does. And even as victims, they didn’t want to destroy his image. 
Furthermore, it’s too tough thing to speak about, and actually and partly they benefited from him in several ways. So, they reproach themselves, they just couldn’t speak up and just confused for a long time.

But part of victims already realize that MJ lied, enticed, and used them for sexual purpose and these facts are still killing them. His crime is serious. 
They might thought if they just keep quiet, be patient, endure and get over everything alone, everything goes fine. But it’s too much. Their mind broke down. 
I’m amazed that it took more than twenty years for them to speak up about the sexual abuse when they’re children. 
I just can’t stand the criminal still get a fame and good image. Also I was deceived.
Undercover of good guy image, some jerks doing really bad stuff. Please keep it in mind.I can only say this thing so far. #metoo

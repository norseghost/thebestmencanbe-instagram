This is a subject that really does hit home with me and it affects both Men and Women.

When I post, it is always from personal experience and I have empathy for women, however I am a Man and we rarely speak up about this and I cannot speak as a Women as I am not one.

When women speak up in a positive and helpful way, I usually offer empathy and will also point out that Men are also affected and most women are accepting of that.

On here I come across some very angry and negative accounts that are ran by Women and for me they do not raise awareness, they are constantly attacking and using terms like "All Men" and that is not true and it is not helpful.

Whilst I accept that there are Women that have been badly hurt by Men and it is not for me to suggest what you should not post, I urge you to think whether what you post will actually change opinions, other than get a following of like minded and angry people?

Even if less Men are supposedly being coerced or are in relationships where they are being physically and mentally abused, they or we do not deserve to have that pain reduced as it is no less than a woman and it is well known that men are far more reluctant to report incidents and re far less believed.

My take in this is that it would be far better for men and women to sit down and educate and work together when it comes to these matters as it is not a single gender issue.

It is brilliant to see so many women in the public eye that spoke up about the abuse that they are receiving and to see campaigns like #metoo however where is the campaign to highlight men? where is the support for men? are we not deserving?

I was raised with the attitude that it was okay for women to be abusive and that I should not do anything and when I think about that now, it has created a whole generation of men who have remained silent and have suffered and that cannot be right.

It is NOT a Man v Woman it is a people v an issue.

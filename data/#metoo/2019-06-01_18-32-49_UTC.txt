Awomen. 💁🏿‍♀️ 🏳️‍🌈🌼🌷This time of year there is so much pressure on vulnerable girls and women to have a perfect shape 💁🏽‍♀️ shaved legs 🦵, beautiful tan 🏖 and no flaws whatsoever. 
Well, that is simply not reality (thank god ✌️). We are all flawed physically and that’s what makes us so unique. Would y’all really like it if the only girls you saw on beaches were blonde, tall  and dangerously  skinny?
A cliched world is boring. Let’s be ourselves! 😘🍊🙅‍♀️ •

Today I stood in solidarity with members of the Senator and House and survivors demanding the resignation of Senator Daylin Leach, who has been repeatedly accused of sexual harassment, bullying, sexual assault and overall misconduct unbecoming anyone in an elected position. It is untenable that he has chosen to double-down on a false narrative that he is somehow the victim and has gone to great lengths to silence the woman who have so bravely come forward-including filing an erroneous law suit against them.  Enough is enough. #timesup #metoo #survivors #sexualviolence

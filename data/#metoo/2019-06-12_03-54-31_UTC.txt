Being involved intensively as an Advocate in Human Rights and collaborating with UN, I feel sick of this patriarchal society. Alabama voting a bill to give parental rights of rapists and people more and more brainwashed with internet, you know something is going wrong with this world. Following the #metoo movement I have been approached to collaborate with a worldwide project foundation helping survivors victims of sexual abuse. Stay tuned. More to come!

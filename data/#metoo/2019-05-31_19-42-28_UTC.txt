„ÄêRecall ...sorry for getting scary...i just cry to release some pain inside ...„Äë
When the #metoo nightmare hunting me, when I have to "recall + describe every details to people" of the case, it doesn't matter I have to describe it during the court,  before or after the court, before or after I report this to cop ; the traumatic pain tore my counsciousness into pieces of shit, I was tore openly transparent like a broken doll to let strangers to see and judge my situation. It remainds me while I watched the ExorcistÔºàFOX tv ), all the human being have their last free will closed & locked tight in their deepest subconsciousness, priest found their last humanity scared and helpless in that room, priest do whatever to save their soul in pain, fight against devil outside that room.

Back to the real world , how many people like me suffering ? Can cop protect us? Does social system function well? Will justice system take our life and safety for serious ?

Women/Men who falsely claim to have been raped is indeed a very very serious issue and should be dealt a lot more strictly than it now is. They are the reason other people become reluctant to believe a rape accusation easily. So this makes them part of the reason people who have been raped don't report it and are scared to speak up. They are part of the reason people live in fear and silence. They are the reason some rapes continue to exist.
Needless to say how much they destroy a person's life and career. The accused loses his/her credibility, respect and opportunities in life for nothing. Just for a lie
So yes. These people deserve to rot in jail for many many years. This is a serious crime. Just as serious as rape. It destroys too many lives.

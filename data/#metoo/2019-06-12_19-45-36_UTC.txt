I am in love with my life. It took a lot of hard work to get where I am now. Girls if u are struggling in a situation you don't want to bw, here me u can get out. Just put one foot in front of the other and u will find a way. I did. And now I refuse to look back beciase I know what it took to get here and how miserable and unsafe I felt where I came from. Our life is ours. U just need to own ur situation and do something about it. It will get better. We are not our stitations or web are our choices that we make in those situations.

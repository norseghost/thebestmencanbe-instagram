•Making every woman and girl count•
Making Every Women and Girl Count is a UN Women flagship programme that aims to bring about a radical shift in how gender statistics are used, created and promoted at the global, regional and national levels. 
The five-year programme will provide technical and financial support to countries to improve the production and use of gender statistics in order to monitor the implementation of gender equality commitments in the 2030 agenda. 
The programme is generously funded by the governments of Australia, Ireland and the United States of America and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

How it works:
The programme focuses on three key areas:
Enabling environment: Promoting a supportive policy environment to address institutional and financial constraints and to strengthen policies and practices governing the production of gender statistics. 
Data production: Supporting efforts to improve the regular production of gender statistics, including building the technical capacity of the national statistical sys¬tem and providing financial support to collect data to monitor the SDGs and other national commitments. 
Data accessibility: Promoting greater access and analysis of data by users, includ¬ing open access, providing dissemination tools, supporting user-producer dialogues and strengthening the capacity of all relevant actors to use gender statistics in policy and advocacy.

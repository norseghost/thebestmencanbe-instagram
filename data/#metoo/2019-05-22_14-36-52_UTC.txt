I wasn’t dancing. I was barely living. I knew something needed to change, and that something was the little Soul inside me. She needed to be seen and heard and valued in order for me to begin healing. He will indeed turn our mourning into dancing, but we have to allow ourselves to mourn. To grieve. To be still in His healing Presence. This doesn’t happen overnight, it is a journey, a practice... a becoming. Busyness won’t bury your pain deep enough to keep it from clawing it’s way to the surface. Trying to just move past it won’t work either. Like the children’s book “We’re going on a bear hunt”... you can’t go over it, you can’t go around it, you have to go THROUGH it. You must go through it again... feel the pain, embrace the wounds, release the anger and let Love take it and transform it and transform you in the process. IT IS HARD. But, it is worth it!!! You are not what was done to you. You are not meant to carry those wounds through your life... the scars can tell a story if you let them... let it be a good story. A story of freedom and redemption. Of you learning to love YOU! Let Limitless Grace and raw, gritty Truth so piercing it binds up soul holes so huge you never thought you would survive the pain. Mourn. Mourn with your soul. Watch the pain leave. Breathe. Release. Watch Jesus absorb it. He is setting me free. Setting my feet to DANCING. He longs to set you free. #release #mourn #comeoutofhiding #healing #grace #freedom #metoo  #dance #jesus #becoming #survivor #selfcare #mentalhealth #wetoo #sethdahl @sethdahl thanks for that quote!

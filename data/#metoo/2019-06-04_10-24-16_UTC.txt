Yes it’s great, it’s amazing that we are talking about mental health more. It’s wonderful that we have people speaking up and speaking out. The #metoo #mentalhealth and #itsoknottobeok posts are growing day by day and it’s great, honestly it’s amazing. I want it to carry on, to multiply day on day BUT sometimes I can’t help but wonder how many people are using the # because they feel like they should, because it’s the right thing to do, the trend. Sometimes I wonder how many young people are using a #mentalhealthawareness post when they aren’t even aware that somebody they see every day is suffering and they haven’t noticed?

And, and this is the most important part, even though we’re talking about it, we know it’s there, and we’re singing it from the roof tops, what is actually happening and being done by the people who have the power to make the biggest difference of all?? Is enough being done? ? NO!

I am sick of hearing professionals and politicians in particular, recognising the problem, saying more needs to be done, saying we are listening and then doing NOTHING. Mental health for everybody IS A PRIORITY. Mental health and social and emotional development for children IS A PRIOTY. So treat it as such, fund it, please please FUND IT!!

Please keep talking, keep posting, keeping shouting as loud as you can and maybe if we keep doing that for long enough it will get the support it needs.

Well done @graziauk for posting this big and bold on your first page. After I was just sighing at the magazine content before me, it was great to see and it needs saying!

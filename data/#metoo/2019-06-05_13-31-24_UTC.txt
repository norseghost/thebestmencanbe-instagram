Stop killing animals ðŸ˜ž @manchesterpigsave @get_reposter 
During our last vigil, the pigs we witnessed were seen vomiting and extremely anxious. It was also a very hot day and the pigs were very warm. 
They do not get water on their journey.
These innocent animals do not deserve what happens to them.
Do something about it, go vegan.

Thank you to @the_choice_is_clear for spending time with and showing compassion to this pig while they were very unwell.

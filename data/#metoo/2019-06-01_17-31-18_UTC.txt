Outfit for day 1 of reunions - practicality first. The bum bag is a great way to carry cards and keys without hauling around a massive backpack and platform boots give you height to see the music acts while being comfortable enough to dance.

Yesterday was fucking overwhelming; I reunited with the people who had basically been a family to me for two of the most crazy and transformative years of my life. I nearly cried because there were so many memories to relive. We danced until 4 am, cooked fried shit, and then I woke up the next morning in the same outfit to go to a #metoo panel, where we walked out on Brett Kavanaugh's lawyer. And that was the chill day.

Many who are beginning their recovery from religious wounding may find it difficult to trust their feelings. This could largely be because some have had “theology“ wielded against them. Scripture has been twisted to convince them (especially women) that their heart/inner person is only deceitful. This leads to a dangerous way of life in which it is normal and encouraged to distrust one’s instincts and label uncomfortable emotions as “evil” or “the enemy.” This spiritual trauma leads to constant self-doubt and endless circles of reasoning. 
In recovery, we learn that Creator breathed emotion into us, imparting instincts we can trust. We begin to see that sometimes we fear certain people or places for a good reason- because they are not safe. 
Healing from spiritual trauma helps us re-tune to the Voice of Creator and reconnects us to the Spirit of Truth.

What is The #YouArePower Project? ðŸ’Œ 
The #YouArePower Project partners with existing organizations/coalitions across the state of Michigan to promote their events, fundraising campaigns, and volunteer searches to a diverse audience of experienced activists, new faces, and passionate game-changers.

We are a hub for statewide activism, & seek to eliminate the stratification of information across the web. 
Our followers can find ways to get involved and tackle the issues close to their hearts with the click of a button on our website, or on any of our social media accounts.

We are currently in the construction stage, devoting our time to building meaningful connections with our audience and organizations across Michiganâ€“â€“our website is still under construction, too!

That's why we need YOU to join The #YouArePower community! 
Help us learn about amazing non-profits in MI, connect with outstanding activists, and spread the message: We all have the power to make change.

This is what digital democracy looks like. ðŸ—£

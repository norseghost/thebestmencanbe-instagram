On the eve of the FIFA Womenâ€™s World Cup, our focus is not just on the Inspiring women playing on pitches across France.

There is a movement developing around the world to empower girls and women through sports. Playing football offers girls an opportunity to build their self-esteem, courage and confidence.

This translates into everyday life â€“ it encourages them to take initiative, raise their voices and attempt things they never thought possible. When community members see girls achieve in football, they recognise their potential to achieve in other areas.

The Red Robe Hooded Blanket was designed to give people an opportunity to protest with their dollar.

Maybe you've been feeling (in recent conversations) like, "what more can I do? How can I express my support for bodily autonomy?".

Please take the time to repost and spread this mission like wildfire.

#TriggerWarning 
In observance of Men’s Health Month In June as well as #nationalptsdawarenessmonth observed in June we do encourage our community to sit down with their black sons and watch this movie and also facilitate open and HONEST discussions about these events and the incidents that took place during the trial. These unfortunate circumstances are way too common and the harsh reality for many of our black youth/adults, being accused and facing HARD time for things they didn’t do and then suffering the after effect  of severe mental health issues and how it affects them on a daily. These young men didn’t deserve this and no amount of money will give them back all the years taken away from them.

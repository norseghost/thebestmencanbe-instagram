One day, what if?
you try to tag me in a meme
and you get to know later that
we are just a memory now.

One day, what if?
you find a post "tag your best buddy" and
your keyboard yearns for my name
but only what you can do is
just use the backspace.

One day, what if?
you come across our promises which
we maintained like streaks
and later you come to know
it was just a mere formality.

One day, what if?
you type and send your doubts
but find your hope turning blue
but ticks are still grey.

One day, what if?
you put a story of a new dish
you tried last night but
cannot unveil the fact
that you missed my company.

One day, what if?
this internet stops
phone calls disrupts
texts get undelivered.

Would you visit home?
in search of me
and a coffee?

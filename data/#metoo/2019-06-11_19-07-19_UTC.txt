Why do I agree with so much of this - I'm so shook. So if I have to explain why I think this:
‚†Ä‚†Ä
1. As asexuals do not feel any attraction to anyone at all, while LGBT stands for just that, they do not belong in the community. They are valid, although, and still deserve to celebrate on their own.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
2. I'm neutral on this one. I do think pansexual = bisexual since there isn't any "clear" difference between them, but the transphobic/biphobic is debateable. I think wheter you like or dislike to date trans people and non-binary people are preferences and stay outside of the sexuality spectrum.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
3. Yes, there are two biological genders. That is scientifically proven. But I think you can identify as non-binary (or genderfluid) as well.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
4. This is the most important one for sure. The people who are transgender without having gender dysphoria can hurt the community and the people who actually suffer from it. Gender dysphoria is a MENTAL ILLNESS. You can feel pain from it.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
5. This should be obvious and self-explanatory.

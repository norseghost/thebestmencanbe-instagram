You finally get the call that you’ve got an interview, but now what? The short answer is...be prepared!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Here are a few things that will make you stand out during your interview:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1. Before your interview, do your research. Research the company, the hiring managers, and the company’s Glassdoor reviews.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
2. Prepare some smart questions (about 5). This will show the hiring manager that you did your research.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Some examples of questions are “what are the top 3 qualities you’re looking for in an ideal candidate?” or “how would you describe the company and team culture?”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
3. Turn the tables around and find out why the hiring manager enjoys working for the company. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Being prepared will go a long way and help you stand out as a candidate.

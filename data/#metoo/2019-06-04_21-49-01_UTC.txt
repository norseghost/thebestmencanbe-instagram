Something I struggle so badly with is feeling like I’m strong. I don’t believe I am. I get so uncomfortable when someone tells me I’m strong (thankfully, I don’t hear that much) I get so down about my abuse & the life I have to live now as a result, I blame myself & I just allow it all to consume me. That’s the complete opposite of being strong. #survivor #MeToo #SupportSurvivors

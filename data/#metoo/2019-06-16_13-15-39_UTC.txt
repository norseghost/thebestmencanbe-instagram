A Victim Impact Statement is an opportunity for the victim to give an oral or written statement about how the actions of the rapist or abuser have affected their lives. When the accused perpetrator is found guilty, this statement is given after the trial and during the sentencing of the convicted person or parole hearings.  The statement is an opportunity for the victim/survivor/testifier to share how this traumatic experience has affected them and their lives, which they don’t get to do during the trial. The judge takes their statement into consideration when deciding on the criminal’s sentence. Perhaps the most well known example of a Victim Impact Statement is the one that took the world by storm after the Brock Turner trial. Did you read the Stanford rape case’s Victim Impact Statement letter?

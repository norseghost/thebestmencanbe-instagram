Let me share my story. I used to run regularly for fitness. But the day after Thanksgiving 2018 (which I was so excited to run after stuffing myself with amazing food) I had an incident. A man, who was in a psychotic episode, tried to hit me with his car multiple times. MULTIPLE. Meaning u-turns and running onto the sidewalk. I can still see him yelling "slut" to me.
I didn't realize how this affected me until I've put work out clothes on many times and I would just freeze and stare out the window. Wanting to run, knowing it was good for me,  but I was stuck. I've always been wary of my safety, but this cemented in my head that I'm safer at home. 
I'm so fucking tired of being treated like this. I'm tired of men public exposing themselves to me, chasing after me and yelling "I'll rape you bitch," following me, or telling me that I'd look prettier if I smiled. 
I'm going to try my best to use this as motivation to take care of myself. I may not be able to control what others do, but my time here is limited and I have goals to achieve. #girlswhorun  #feminist #strongwomen #metoo #donttellmetosmile #timesup #depression #anxiety

I feel like I'm the only person with this many encounters. I know I'm not. We just don't speak about it.

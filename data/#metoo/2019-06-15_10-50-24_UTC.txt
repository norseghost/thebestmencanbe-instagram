NPD (narcissistic personality disorder) and Borderline Personality Disorder are much more common than people think. Almost always where there is Parental Alienation theres a cluster B personality disorder behind the instigator. Sweden doesnt even look into this. Since the dont "believe" in Parental Alienation, no one knows the literature behind it. They just believe the accusations and move on like they are true even when there is no evidence of anything and that way they break people and children evry single day for free... I wonder if they would do that with other crimes too and not investigate evidence the kind of rates of innocent people that would be punished would be.......PARENTAL ALIENATION IS REAL. PARENTAL ALIENATION IS CHILD ABUSE. PARENTAL ALIENATION IS A CRIME. CRIMINALS NEED TO BE PUNISHED. THERE IS NO EXCUSE TO NOT WANT TO HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ABPA WORKS. #sweden #parentalalienation #sverige #espa√±a #erased #mykids #metoo #divorce #understandpa #childabuse #children #falseaccusations #socialservices #tingsratt #erased #mykids #feminists #equality #court #fair #personalitydisorder #clusterb

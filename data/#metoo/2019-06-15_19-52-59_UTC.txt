I know women who chose to be mothers and are great.
I know women who did not ask to be mothers and are wonderful.
I know women who should have never been mothers.
I know women who chose to be mothers for children they did not bare.
Being a mother is not about biology it is about compassion and unconditional love for a helpless and innocent being.

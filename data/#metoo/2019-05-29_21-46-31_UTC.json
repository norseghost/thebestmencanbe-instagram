I bought groceries for fajitas tonight because it\u2019s their favorite, but they won\u2019t be having it, because they aren\u2019t here. For the past several years I have been guarded about what I say online about the girls\u2019 father because I thought it was in their best interest. Someone gave me the advice to never trash the other parent to the kids, no matter how much they do it and the kids will be better for it. I took that advice even though I desperately wanted to help other women by telling my story b/c I thought by protecting their image of him, both in what I\u2019ve said to them, and by keeping my silence publicly, it\u2019d be best. It seems however that by doing so I\u2019ve actually encouraged him to feel he can do whatever he wants and he\u2019s untouchable. And now his actions are hurting my sweet girls more than me telling the truth ever could. Today, again, I\u2019ve driven to the school, on my legally scheduled custody day, and found them unexpectedly gone. Done so as a means to punish me for crossing him. At least that\u2019s why I think he does it, that\u2019s what narcissists do when you don\u2019t fall in line, they correct you by whatever means necessary. Let me be very clear, I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. There is a long list of women who have suffered extreme consequences for standing up to him. And I\u2019m one of them. He knows the only way he can still hurt me is through the girls, no matter what it does to them in the process.\nI will spend every penny I have to fight this legally even though it\u2019s frightening to know how much his millions of dollars a year salary can buy him, but one thing I won\u2019t be scared of anymore is using my voice. I hope you won\u2019t judge me too harshly for speaking publicly, I hope once you know the full truth you\u2019ll understand. If it saves them one more day of the pain and confusion I know they\u2019re feeling tonight it will have been worth it. I\u2019ll be posting on my blog where I can write everything & will let you know here as I do. Please pray for my sweet girls tonight, they don\u2019t understand and every time this happens it seems to effect them worse. Pray that God will bring them comfort until I can."

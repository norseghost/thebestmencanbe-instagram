In the wake of what seemed to be a sudden upsurge of the #meetooindia movement, I hereby dedicate excerpts from my piece "She Woman" to every woman who has had the courage to speak up in a world that swears to deem her wrong, unworthy and decadent for the same reasons that it would perhaps, deem a man right and worthy of forgiveness. To read the whole piece (published as a blogpost by @shethepeopletv ), click on the link in bio.

Without consent, sexual activity is considered to be sexual assault or rape.

Anyone can change their mind about what they feel like doing, anytime. Even if you’ve done it before, and even if you’re both naked in bed.

Shame Undone Life seeks to create a culture of change that involves entire communities openly having a discussion on recognizing the affects of sexual assault and refusing to tolerate any form of sexual assault or violence.

Breaking the silence. Educating through compassion. Undoing the shame.

Alabama passed a chemical castration bill for sex offenders. According to the bill, chemical castration would be a mandatory condition of parole for lawbreakers over the age of 21 who are convicted of sex crimes.
.
While chemical castration sounds severe, it merely suppresses testosterone, which is not an equivocal response to sexualt assault. It also doesn't address situations where the rapist is in it not for sex, but to exert power over another individual. In general, it's a bandaid and not a real solution. .

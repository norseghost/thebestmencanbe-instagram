Something you might not know about me....
ðŸ’«
When Iâ€™m not coaching entrepreneurs on how to write bestselling books, or facilitating leadership retreats/workshops, Iâ€™m passionate about supporting causes that support healthy communication and conflict resolution. One is mediating for youth offenders to keep them out of the juvenile court system and get them back on track. The other is empowering targets of sexual harassment with communication skills. #YesIWillTalk is a book project and movement my co-author and co-facilitator @rayemitchell and I are launching this week.
ðŸ’«
Together, we are now offering the Yes, I Will Talk Sexual Harassment and Leadership Training Program - a unique interactive, multi-disciplined-skills based sexual harassment and prevention program that goes beyond the standard compliance-based programs offered in the market.

Completion feels so good!

Farage’s nod to Steve Bannon certainly hasn’t aged well in the context of the recent storm around Cambridge Analytica’s influence over the EU referendum.

It was revealed that data from 50 million Facebook profiles were looked at against the electoral register, and then used to build an algorithm which analyses people’s personality traits in relation to their voting behaviour.

This data could then be used to find potential swing voters and create messages tailored to influence them politically.

The firm’s vice president at the time was Steve Bannon, who was also head of the right-wing website Breitbart and was running Donald Trump’s campaign to become US President.

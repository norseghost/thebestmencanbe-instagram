                        "text": "Very excited to show everyone the final cover for @areyoumyobject's DADDY ISSUES, out soon. Pre-order through the link in our bio!\n-\n\u2018A timely, necessary work from one of our most vital thinkers. Moving with ease across psychoanalysis, popular culture and literary criticism, weaponising the thought of Woolf, Winnicott and Solanas,\u00a0Daddy Issues\u00a0flips the familial script and takes aim at all our Daddies: domestic, cultural, patriarchal, even presidential. The result is a wincingly perceptive, deeply engaged book, one that takes us into the dark heart of a cultural fixation, then shows us, with deep care and empathy, the way back out.\u2019\u2014Sam Byers, author of\u00a0Perfidious Albion\n.\n\u2018This is a brave and brilliant book by one of the most insightful and articulate writers at work today. Katherine Angel is unafraid to look head on at the forgotten figure in feminism\u2019s critique of patriarchy: the father. All of us, daughters and sons, mothers and fathers, are enriched by confronting these libidinal energies, these daddy issues at the centre of all of our lives.\u2019 \u2014 Lauren Elkin, author of\u00a0Fl\u00e2neuse: Women Walk the City in Paris, New York, Tokyo, Venice, and London\n.\n\u2018A brilliant investigation into the father figure in culture that is also a powerful intervention in the #MeToo debate. Through it all, I think, sounds a call to be present for each other, attentive and open, willing to work for each other\u2019s full personhood.\u2019 \u2014 Adam Foulds, author of\u00a0The Quickening Maze\n.\n\u2018In\u00a0Daddy Issues, Katherine Angel holds the image of the father in a steady, critical gaze, generating both questions and hesitations, and opening up a vital space in which to challenge how power works in the family.\u2019 \u2014 David Hayden, author of\u00a0Darker with the Lights on\n.\n\u2018In this probing and erudite essay, Katherine Angel asks \u201cIs it ever possible to get rid of the father, or is he forever internalised?\u201d Angel traces the many ways that culture and life reflect the needs of father figures over and above those of \u201cdaughters\u201d, and how through both imagination and collective attention, we can begin to see and dismantle some of this power. A beautiful and necessary read.\u2019 \u2014 Emilie Pine, author of\u00a0Notes to Self"

I know the stress far too well of having to go to multiple appointments with doctors and specialists to diagnose what is going on inside your body. From me I had peso terrible they thought it was my gallbladder. I had reflux but no acid. The doctor put me on Nexium which made my pain worse. I ended up going to a naturopath who had me drink lemon and baking soda and expected me to burp 50 times in one minute. But I didn't burp at all. My stomach had no acid it was all alkaline so nothing was digesting properly. It was like my stomach was happy to receive the baking soda and lemon and I had to drink apple cider vinegar in her every time I ate. Plus testing my pH balance. I learned that high stress can take away your stomach acid. I just wish that doctors would be more open to alternative medicines that are proven to work

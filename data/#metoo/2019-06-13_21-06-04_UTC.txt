Survival mode ðŸ’‰
I painted my face and took this photo an hour after I was followed and harassed by an older man, who tried to touch me on the beach in broad daylight. He waited until I was alone, and came back four times and was stocking me. I told him I was married, that he was making me uncomfortable, and to leave me alone. He respected none of what I told him, and I literally had to run away from him back to my car and drive someplace else to be safe. The night before, a young man tried dragging me onto the beach, away from my friend, and against my will despite me pushing him off and telling him NO. This is the closest I have ever been to being raped, and I am so thankful I was able to get out of that situation without being physically harmed. All of this happening within 24 hours has left me feeling like PREY. The fire inside of me is raging, and has been ever since these incidences while I was in Sicily. This has brought out a lot of anger I have harbored towards men (that I thought was healed ðŸ˜…). As I deal with this shit again, ladies, please be smart. Donâ€™t let these sick individuals get away with shit. Weâ€™re at war with the toxic masculine. If we give in, look the other way, etc., we are not changing ANYTHING and are only prolonging the suffering of women. If youâ€™re a man reading this, please hold your brothers accountable. If you look the other way, youâ€™re guilty too.

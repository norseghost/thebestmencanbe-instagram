                        "text": "'I GOT FLOWERS TODAY'\n.\nIn this age of digital media controlling most of the activities that take place in our daily lives, there's a lot at stake that can make or mar you or your business. The most important question is how do we know when to incorporate storytelling into the right place and at the right time - THE WHEN.\n.\nTime is of the essence - Efficiency. Storytelling isn't such a complex word or act to understand anymore as in my previous post, it was well explained. Guess what? It can and should be used any time. As long as your goal is to create a connection with your audience client, or environment - then make it work for you!\n.\nAn example of awesome storytelling was the 'I GOT FLOWERS TODAY' short movie that got lots of views and reposts. It came at a critical time when intense conversations on the physical and domestic abuse of women were happening with several campaigns like the #MeToo encouraging women empowerment and unity. What it did in a nutshell was gradually drag our attention, hit the purpose of the production on the head and the best part - used an unexpected tag line that made people interested in watching it.\n.\nIn Marketing and Content Creation, it's like fishing. Set the bait by creating a demand, start those conversations that make the audience think about what's to come, that's like placing your hook with the bait into the river not knowing what to expect. The river here is the entire world, a pool of persons with diversities, everyone who has access to that traditional and digital platform you're using.\n.\nNaturally, the fishes that are attracted to the bait and have picked interest in your content come closer, then BOOM! They're hooked, then you drag them out closely and gradually.\n.\nThe fish here you're dragging out is your Target Audience, the specific people your content is made for. STORYTELLING HERE IS THE BAIT.\n.\nIsn't it beautiful?? Tag a creator who needs to see this.\n.\n#TheUgonna #Inmeforyou #ContentCreator #NigerianBlogger #FashionBlogger #AnOwerriBabe #Wordpress #TheBloggersAdvocate #Style #Storyteller #Storytelling #AnOwerriBabe"

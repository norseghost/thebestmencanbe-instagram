Omg I felt very violated today. I was shopping for pots for my new plants at @homesensecanada @vaughan_mills today with my girlfriend. She observed a man walking towards my direction while I was on the phone. The man circled around me and was standing very close behind me with a backpack in his hand. My gf saw him stretched out his arm with the backpack underneath my dress, so she quickly grabbed my arm and pulled me out. We were certain he had a camera in there taking videos or photos underneath my dress. He was gone when I went back to find him. We reported to the store security and mall security right away. Apparently this is not the first time that this has been reported..

I feel very uncomfortable that there are people like him out there doing this to women. In the moment, I wish I could have done something but I was on an important phone call. But the important thing is that I reported it and the securities will be alert of a pervert in the premises. I hate to have perverts like him get away with it, so with my report, I am helping other women as well. Perverts are everywhere and women neednâ€™t tolerate their cheap thrills, profound violation and sexual assaults. Our flawed humanity needs major repairment and we (women) should not condone them.

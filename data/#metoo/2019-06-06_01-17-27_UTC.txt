Here are some #funfacts about me: 🌍 I’ve lived, worked, and studied on three continents, and have visited over 11 countries! 🎓 In another life, I was an academic. I studied at three of the top ten universities in the world. 💪🏽 My absolute favorite thing is supporting other women and their dreams. No room for jealousy here; I’m here and holding space and you #grow! #metoo 🙋🏽‍♀️ I want to more about you! Tell me a bit about you in the comments!

“Even in churches, you might only have access to children once a week on Sundays, whereas with schools it’s five days of the week, nine months of the year.” — one of the most heartbreaking lines I’ve heard throughout this months-long investigation on predatory teachers. I could go on and on about how heartbreaking these stories are to report on, but I am amazed over and over again at how brave students are to share their stories. This is one of those stories — a new piece today on the ways predatory teachers “groom” students before abusing them. Link in bio. ✨ (I also really wanted to show off this powerful illustration by @hokyoungkim_ for @voiceofsandiego)

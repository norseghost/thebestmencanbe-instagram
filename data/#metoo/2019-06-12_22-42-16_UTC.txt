The problem is, men are afraid that even if they behave properly in the workplace, they'll be falsely accused of harassment anyway. That's why they don't want to be alone with women.

This whole narrative that 'false accusations are common' is SO HARMFUL to gender equality, and harmful to women getting ahead in the workplace.

People don't seem to understand that false accusations are ğŸ“£ğŸ“£ğŸ“£vanishingly rareğŸ“£ğŸ“£ğŸ“£ (about 2%), and that if men don't do anything wrong, they'll actually be fine. Â¯\ _(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

A few years ago, I tried to be someone different. I ran away from a career after being sexually harassed, and chose to keep what happened to me a secret. I thought I could find a new me. 
Like so many women, I was forced to confront what happened when #MeToo went viral in the fall of 2017. I realized I needed to face my fear, and dare to be myself- and that meant telling my story, reclaiming my voice, and getting back on the path I was on before. 
Over the last year and a half, daring to be myself has connected me to other advocates, activists, and community members who are also daring to be themselves. Yes, it’s still a bit frightening, but together we have turned that fear into the ability to lift up the voices of marginalized communities.

I can’t wait to keep doing that as your congressional representative. #RunWithErica

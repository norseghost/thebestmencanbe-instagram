Celebrating our first year of operation today! Last year we launched Project SEEN Photographic Memoirs Class for sex industry survivors with the "soul" intention of shifting stigmas. We have a long road ahead for women to be SEEN in the fullness of their GLORY. It's an honor to work alongside such a Diverse, Strong, Resilient, and Authentic group of women these days while watching new survivor owned nonprofit organizations and businesses successfully launch & flourish! We are a community of grassroots leaders blazing new trails to help end sexual Exploitation through economic equity. 🌟🌟🌟 Live your passion with purpose, on purpose! I want to express my Deepest heartfelt gratitude for all of our supporters, collaborative partners, affiliates and volunteers. Without you none of this is possible! Together we are stronger ⚡️⚡️⚡️💯⚡️⚡️⚡️

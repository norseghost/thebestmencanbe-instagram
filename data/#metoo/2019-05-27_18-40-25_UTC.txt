This week we are taking a close look at the making of a child sex abuse victim by analyzing the personal experience of child sex abuse shared by co-host of The Real, Jeannie Mai, and her mother, whom is affectionately known as Mama Mai.

The cycle of abuse starts way before the abuser ever touches the victim. Remember, child sex abuse occurs when there is access and opportunity, which means the abuser has to create the access and opportunity or in some cases, the access and opportunity presents themselves. This can also be called the initial phase of the grooming process. 
In Jeannie's case, her abuser was presented with his opportunity because he was able to fulfill a need. The family needed a babysitter, and since most families never suspect that those closest to them are capable of such heinous behavior, the abuser is granted immediate access and opportunity. It is this trust factor that predators count on that makes creating their victim fairly easy. All the predator needs to do is "publicly display" appropriate familial behavior towards the child and both the child and parent(s) trust that the predator is a safe contact. Hence, the reason we are so adamant that family members need to be vetted as safe contacts as much as strangers are.
Tomorrow we will look at what the initial contact may look like in the making of a victim during the cycle of abuse. #childsexabuseawareness #stopchildsexabuse #childsexabusesurvivor #parentsofchilldsexabusesurvivor #sexualassault #endchildsexabuse #endrapeculture #childabuse #sextrafficking #atlanta #ATL #Georgia #church #girls #teens #awareness #rapevictim #victim #children #prevention #trafficking  #survivor #tips #blogger #speaker #metoo #advocate #volunteer  #socialmedia

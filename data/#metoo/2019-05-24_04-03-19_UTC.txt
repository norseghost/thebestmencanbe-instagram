My name is Nicole Moehring. I am the founder of Voices of Change 2018. My daughter and I founded this organization after our family was effected by abuse. We are sharing our stories to empower and encourage others to speak up, if they have been a victim of abuse. A parents worst nightmare is to find out your child was abused in anyway but to find out they were sexually abused or assaulted, is gut wrenching. I am here to help others through their dark time. Your not alone. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to talk or work together to put an end to child abuse. I am available through DM or email: voicesofchange2018@gmail.com. I am not a doctor, I am a mom who believed her children and began using my voice to speak up and advocate for those who may not be able too. You are not alone! #voicesofchange2018tm #bethechangeyouwanttosee #ifyouseeseesomethingsaysomething #reportchildabuse #endchildabusenow #changestartswithus #endchildsexualabuse #endchildpornography #endchildmolestation #metoo #imasurvivornotavictim #survivor #parentsofachildwithspecialneeds #parentsofchildrenwhohavebeensexuallyabused #justicefortheinnocent #justiceforthechildren #stoptheperpetrators #speakup #stophidingchildabuse #notmysecret

As Iâ€™ve started holding healing space for others, Iâ€™ve been reflecting on my own #trauma and #ptsd #healingjourney. Itâ€™s the aha moments that stand out the most. Like the moment when Christy @theunrulywoman asked me in a space healing workshop why, after finishing my entire apartment, Iâ€™d been avoiding my desk. She knew it wasnâ€™t about the clutter. Only then did I realize the desk was where all the papers from my marriage and divorce were, all of the receipts from money urgently sent for imaginary emergencies, and the letter I wrote to Peace Corps apologizing for being raped. All of the things that Iâ€™d been avoiding emotionally unpacking were hiding in the desk. And now I had a witness inviting me to explore.
.
That moment eventually led to therapy, to writing my #metoo story years before the bigger movement, to finding #freedom by inviting the collective to witness the pain Iâ€™d internalized. And it continues to unravel within me today, 15 years this month from the initial attack, 10 from the finalization of the divorce (the end of the relationship that triggered the ptsd). One moment of realization led to 4 years of intensive healing work. Led to holding gatherings with Christy @theunrulywoman for others to explore whatâ€™s hidden in their #subconscious and illuminate how to use the fierce #anger of past hurts, of present day conflict, to fuel change and #transformation. #ðŸ’™ Experience your own aha moment with us on June 14.

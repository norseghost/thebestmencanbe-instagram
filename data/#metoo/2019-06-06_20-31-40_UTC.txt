I'm honored to be presenting a free 1-hour CEU lecture at CHS on Friday June 28th at 1:15 pm. Sign up and come listen if you're interested in learning about how to assess for pornography addiction and how to treat the unresolved emotional issues that can be fueling it. Can't wait to drop back in to my old stomping ground!

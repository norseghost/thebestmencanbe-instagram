I read a lot of leadership books but it’s also important to make space for stories that allow us to tap into our humanity, for it’s our humanity that frame how we lead.
.
Most recently, I read The Apology by @eveensler .
.
As the @washingtonpost described it, “the novelist, activist and playwright, who shot to fame in the ’90s with ‘The Vagina Monologues,’ has long said her father, Arthur Ensler, who died more than 30 years ago, sexually and physically brutalized her as a child.
.
The book — or rather, the novella, as it clocks in at around 120 pages — is an unnerving, imaginative exercise and a harrowing account of abuse.”
.
Told from the point of view of Ensler’s father, the novel is brutal, raw, honest, painful, and yet somehow necessary, not only for survivors but for humanity, encouraging us to examine ourselves as Ensler forces the spirit of her father to examine himself.
.
The decisions we make on a daily basis, often quickly and automatically, are informed by past experiences and background. Sometimes we don’t even realize how our past effects how we act today, because we choose to forget.
.
Ensler calls this act of forgetting “diabolical amnesia”, when instead of reckoning with our past, we choose to ignore it.
.
This phenomena is relevant to leaders because when we don’t name the things that define us and work to heal any negativity lodged inside of us, others usually bear the brunt of our detachment - that includes the people we lead.
.
Issues might manifest as unconscious bias, lack of empathy, or unrealistic expectations. And if we’re unaware of our triggers, we stand to misconstrue the intent of our people, be more cynical and ultimately, keep our teams at a distance.
.
People aren’t looking for perfect leaders, but we respond better to leaders who are aware of who they are and what brought them there. Spend some time examining yourself, and perhaps even writing your own apology.

Thank you, @rachel.cargle for the book recommendation. As difficult as it was to read, it’s a story that must be heard.

The season 2 announcement is coming soon friends. 
While we wait, can y'all do me a favour?
I love what I do! I love creating content and a space for women to share their stories of motherhood & more!  This podcast has been a dream come true and I would love to get it into as many ears as possible! .
Could you take 3 min and leave me a review on iTunes (or wherever you listen to Podcasts)? The more positive ratings and reviews a podcast has the more iTunes pushes it out for more people to find It! .
I love this community we ar3 building here! A Space where women can come and share their stories, where one mama sharing her journey gives another permission to say "me too" and maybe show herself a little grace, and a space where women can cheer eachother on as they chase after their dreams (whatever they may be).
.
Have you been encouraged by any of the stories that the season 1 guests have shared?🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️
I know I have!! .
Can't wait for Season 2 ❤

While the media is pushing their self-initiated pride protest stories, and telling people all about Nazis, evangelicals and others who keep trying to bring about repression; stop for a moment to think what they are really trying to distract US from.  What is going on in DC, or at the state level?  No one hears about this because it doesn’t fit the partisan/identity political reinforcement messages.  In WA State, we are about to have 1639 shit all over gun rights., yet most citizens have no clue.  Other initiatives are happening all over the Nation.
“They” promote division through feigning support for LGBTQ as in opposition to main-stream beliefs.  Guess what, no one really cares what others do/say or who they love—-but we all should care about how the media is shaping the narrative to support slowly eliminating OUR rights.  The #Shootback Gadsden is one subtle way to truly emphasize the growing awakening that is happening; however, a tremendous amount of work is needed.  Human rights are human rights, but will only continue to be realities if we stop letting others work against them.  Enough is enough. #pride #2a #paganpatriot #feminism #gaypride #gunrightsarehumanrights #civilrights #gunowners #enoughusenough #metoo #notonemore #mylastshot #lgbtq🌈 #pridemonth #equality #equalrights #liberty @govinslee @cnn @foxnews

A reminder that our office handles complaints of sexual harassment by housing providers (landlords, maintenance workers, etc.) Sexual harassment includes any unwanted sexual advance, request for sexual favors, or other unwelcome verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature. Even if you have a criminal history. Even if you have been evicted. Even if you were behind on your rent. You can read more on our Fact Sheet at: https://www.fhcmichigan.org/fair-housing-fact-sheets

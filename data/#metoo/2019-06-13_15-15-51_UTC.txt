The first picture features several carved wooden blocks and phrases of polarising issues over the past year both within India and outside as well. It raises awareness and highlights how far we've come and how much work still needs to be done. 2018 was a year in which we saw the post effects of the #MeToo movement and a growing problem with refugee immigration as countries refused or were reluctant to receive more refugees along with many other ongoing issues.

I found this installment at Pepper House where we stopped for some snacks. Pepper House is well-known contemporary cafe with a gallery, a design shop and library in a colonial-style building. It is made up of a warehouse with Dutch style clay roofs which are separated by a large courtyard which would have once been used for storing goods waiting to be loaded onto ships in the harbour. The hopes of this area is that it will one day serve a multi-purpose space that will host and promote visual arts year round in Kochi. You can find several areas like this around Fort Kochi, an ideal place for those with an eye for aesthetics.

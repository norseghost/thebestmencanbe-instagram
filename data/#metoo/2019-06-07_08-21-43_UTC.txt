Thank you. Thank you for your responses to my last post/serious life update. Most truly made me feel..seen. There were some that, admittedly, sat uncomfortably in my chest, but that's hurt I can deal w/ another day. Today was my first more "public" day for Operation Well on Wheels -- or is Hell on Heals more "me"?ðŸ˜‰ It went okays and I wore my Detroit: Become Human shirt for support. Says:

Everything will be alright.ðŸŽ¶

I needed the msg overall, but the game it's from runs so deeply parallel to my journey right now. Going from a child programmed to be someone else's commodity - born, built and trained to deny my humanity, emotions, wants, interests, fears, passions - all to serve those who owned me. This crossroads now is literally about becoming HUMAN. I've already done the work for years and have the empathy, the heart, the warm blood in my veins -- but I've yet to LIVE like a human. Experience fun, freedom, a space to breathe or relax - a chance to know who I am, not just be a machine. Not following orders, not shaped by my software, not sterile or empty. BECOME VIBRANT.

Today went well. I had a monthly drs appt an hour away, randomly got FRENCH FRIES at Wendy's just bc (what?! me?!), went to the grocery store, and then attempted to respond to friends' msgs before giving myself time online. I'm now doing that before bed and will have a similar day tomorrow, but w/ physical therapy. I do feel freer away from the stresses of the internet, but still had 2 friends reach out w/ urgent life problems for me to solve (completely forgetting the boundary I JUST set). But, being less drained from online obligations may've left me more able to be there (but also stand up for myself and REMIND them I'm not to be doing this right now). So, we've had some baby steps.

I do worry how I'll fair once my day doesn't have 6.5hrs of structured time away from home. But, it's not about rigidity or perfection. It's flexibility, listening to mySELF and what I feel I need or want in that moment. ..not following some schedule I set for myself days in advance. We know I can do that. So. Here we go! Learning and sharing along the way! ðŸ’™ðŸ’›ðŸ’œ

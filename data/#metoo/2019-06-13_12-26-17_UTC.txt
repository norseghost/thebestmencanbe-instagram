Fifty women a month are shot and killed by their partners. Domestic violence is the third leading cause of homelessness. And 80 percent of hostage situations involve an abusive partner. Nor is it only a question of physical harm: In some 20 percent of abusive relationships a perpetrator has total control of his victimâ€™s life. (Countries including Britain and France have laws to protect against this kind of abuse, but the United States does not.) #abuse .#hope #IVAC #nomore #domesticviolence #victimsabroad #hope #IVAC #metoo #domesticviolence #survivor #bestrong #dontbeafraid #ivac #victimsabroad #courage #sexualassault #behappy #happy #happyness #nevergiveup #staystrong  #IVAC #victimsabroad #victim #strongwomen #strength #bestrong #survivor #sextrafficking #metoo #takeaction #makeachange #takeastand #breakthecycle #timesup #silencebreakers #loveshouldnthurt #abuse #speakout #takeaction #haveavoice

I am utterly disgusted by this shocking news! When for once we thought someone was standing up for the right reason and community , the true face came out. What is even worse is that the same transgender is screening at @festivaldecannes portraying the life of the LGBT community in #pakistan. I feel its disgusting to give such a person the privilege to represent Pakistan in any platform at all! Try to make this post viral and tag @festivaldecannes to look into this matter! Such a person should seriously be punished for their actions and surely not gain further exposure! Specially not at  @festivaldecannes
I speak for myself I would never want a rapist standing up for the rights of the same community that they are responsible for harming and taking advantage of - Raping! Do not exploit your fame! #kamisid #rani #makeitviral #viral #lgbt

I regret to inform you that your outspoken transgender heroine/ social activist is a rapist & child molester. Kami Sid is cancelled. F disgusting, she abused her power so much. She was supposed to portray the trans community in a good light, now the community will feel even more alienated and will feel threatened by the hands of someone like her. I just hope justice gets served . Also she posted the story describing cause of rapes .. so A RAPIST IS ABOUT TO TELL EVERYONE WHAT THE CAUSE OF RAPE IS? UN FUCKING BELIEVE-ABLE. #Kamisid #metoo #turnsoutbitch #pakistanmediaindustry

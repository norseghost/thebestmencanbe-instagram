Feel empowered without even leaving the couch 📺
⠀
1. “Suffragette”. Set in early 20th century Britain, it follows Maud Watts, a working class washerwoman turned politically engaged freedom fighter, and the militant acts performed by suffragettes. And boy, will the movie make you feel. Angry, violent, sad, happy, empowered.
⠀
2. “Hidden figures”. This movie was so worthy of its Oscar buzz. Celebrating women for their brains, the fact Hidden Figures is based on a real story makes you feel even more empowered.
⠀
3. “Handmaid’s tale”. Is an American dystopian drama web television series. During the past 2 years it gained popularity all over the world, especially among feminists. The show is on it’s third season but its bizarre events still give me heebie jeebies.
⠀
4. “The bold type” – is a hidden gem we’ve recently discovered. It’s a show about three young ladies working in a fashion magazine called Scarlet. The show’s fierce women lead a prime example of what feminism looks like. Very empowering and liberating, recommend!
⠀
5. “Molly’s game”. A brilliant tale about doing the right thing when the wrong thing is far easier, Molly’s Game is compelling, inspiring and incredibly moving – and sure to resonate with any woman sick of “oppressive men and having to play by their rules”.
⠀
Praised be!

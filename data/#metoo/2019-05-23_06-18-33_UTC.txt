HELP MAKE STRANGULATION A FELONY AND STEP PARENTS PROTECTED UNDER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS IN EVERY STATE!

She's mistaken me with someone that cares about custody. I only care about the well being of the child. Are they thriving at school? Do they have good friends? Are they kind? Can they regulate their emotions? Resolve conflict? Have goals? Healthy family bonds? Steal her daughter? Purposely try and put someone in jail? What is this woman smoking? Can't make sense of illogical not based in reality choas so don't try. Nobody was stealing anyone's daughter. She was arrested. And convicted. What's the point of lying after that? Let it go. You did it. Now I have to spread awareness about strangulation. I have to stand with them. All if them. -

This is one of our amazing producers @lisafrance2067 as a young woman, we won't say how long ago. She wanted more than anything to play football so she forced the coaches at her school to comb through the entire rule book to prove that she could indeed be a girl and still join the team. We would be lost without her passion, commitment, and expertise. Thank you to her and our other producers @j_show  @michmakesfilms @syhayaaviel. Plus shout out to @fergusonsr @alonsimcha for their recent contributions. Tomorrow the final countdown begins for our Indiegogo campaign. If you haven't checked it out yet, the link is in the bio!

⭐️FRESHLY WAXED AND POLISHED ⭐️
.
Let’s talk double standards with beauty. This past Saturday, I was so nervous about attending the #wearableartgala where I would be in the same room as some of my biggest celeb idols - and felt genuinely confused on why I was being invited. I woke up early and half-panicking in the morning, and immediately made this long-ass to-do list of all of these tasks I felt like I needed to get done before hitting the red carpet: get my nails done, find the right look, get better earrings, find a makeup and hair artist because idk how to put on lipstick, get my eyebrows and upper lip axes, and shave my legs for the first time in a year…
.
And I did all of that — all while grumbling to myself and thinking that I would not have felt the pressure to do this if I were a guy. As a more public feminist activist, I would like to stand here and say that I could just “fuck it” and in a relaxed way just put on my outfit and go…but no, tbh I felt this anxiety about trying to get EVERYTHING taken care of before stepping out. I usually never wear makeup or feel this in my day-to-day life, but still for these glam events, I feel all of it and to an extreme.
.
Anyways, just something I’m thinking about and going to reflect more on… and regardless, thanks to all of the prep and people who went into this look, I walked in feeling confident and unapologetic af. ❤️❤️❤️

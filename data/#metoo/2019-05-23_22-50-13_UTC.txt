#tbt Recibo miradas raras cuando me pongo este polo pero a veces pienso que es porque mi brasier se trasluce 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ Can I ever win? 
#repost "Feminist: the person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes"
I am grateful to have an education.
I'm grateful I have the opportunity to pursue a career. 
I'm proud of my Latinx heritage, the mixture of Afrolatinos, European and indigenous from both sides of my family.

I am a feminist who wants to get married and have children eventually while my husband and I take care of them, our relationship and reach our professional goals. 
I want you to look at my eyes and not my breasts while I speak.
I did not invite you to touch any part of my body. 
I never led you on for you to sexualize me and make sexual comments about me. 
The size of my hips and my breasts are not your concern. 
I want girls and women in my community and every community to feel safe. 
I do not hate men, I do not judge other people's sexual preference, gender identity, race or nationality. We should all want a world with peace and equal human rights. .

The charity @domesticviolenceuk set up to raise awareness and provide information and support to victims of domestic and emotional abuse.
Do take a look at their page, and checkout their website Dvuk.org for more information. 
You can also purchase merchandise to help support the work they do, such as the t-shirt I purchased in the picture. —————————————

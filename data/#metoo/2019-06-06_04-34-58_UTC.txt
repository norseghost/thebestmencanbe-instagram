Humans of the planet,
When we women, men, kids, animals, any living being becomes an instant victim of someone's narcissistic darkness we have two options: fight or give in. 
@durgagawdestudio fought. But what shames me about being an Indian is the number of people who stood watching as she was being molested and assaulted, yet no one was human enough to help in time of need. We're the sickest kinds of humans who stand by watching such violence. How masochistic and sadistic are we? 
Get this man time and humanity justice.

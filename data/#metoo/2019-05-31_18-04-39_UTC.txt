May all women feel more free, loving, connected and courageous.

May we all love every part of ourselves, especially our "darker" parts. 
May we all support and lift one another.

May we all stand in our true power and see the true power of all other women.

May we all stop comparing and start appreciating, connecting and celebrating fully who we are and those we admire.

May we all say "yes" and "no" only when we mean it.

May we all be kind, not nice.

May we all love fiercly.

This wraps our #FemaleRelationship month. And thank you to our amazing hosts and YOU for reading <3

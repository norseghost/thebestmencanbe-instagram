Peace and Love sis, 
It’s been a week since I’ve last posted and just to let you know I am still here! 
I am healing
Through time and space 
Within and Outwards. 
I found myself exhausted the last two weeks. 
I’ve always had an issue with giving so much of myself in my relationships that I leave no time for myself. 
By the time I am ready to love on me. 
I’m drained. 
So the message/lesson I have recently learned is.. Be selfish. 
With your time, your space, your energy. 
If you are not those around you will not take you into consideration the same way you have for them
And though they may mean no harm by it.. It happens. 
In order to heal, you have to love you FIRST. 
Are you still with me on this journey?? Let’s Talk About It. 
With Love, 
DeyelahDea

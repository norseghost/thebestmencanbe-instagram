What are your favorite flowers? I have plenty of favorites now, though Its hard for a lot of people to believe, I actually used to not care about flowers very much at all! In fact I was a very turned off by the idea of wearing #flowers, having them in my home or anything I deemed excessively "girlie." Of course I still embraced my femininity and loved fashion and makeup, however I took a darker approach to the way I carried myself. A naive, contrast of the woman I am today. Heartbroken, confused, and highly mistreated i.e. #metoo Symphonic Metal Music, an understanding of the beauty/fragility of life/death though bittersweet and supernatural magic very much shaped my early 20's. I absolutely have risen from the ashes, and commend the brave women who have surpassed the "expectations" the world has imposed on them. To rise like the Phoenix, resilient, strong and beautifully imperfectly perfect!  True #wabisabi

Few people know that it was a college speaker who helped ME to realize that I was a victim of domestic violence. I was in a Community Health class when a guest speaker came in, and there it was... my life on a PowerPoint slide.

I can remember thinking, “That’s what this is? I’m a victim of... domestic violence??” I always thought my relationship was “something else.” I knew it was bad, but I could never fully describe it, or put a word to it. But here was that word. “Domestic violence” explained every part of it.

I didn’t leave class that day and decide to leave my abuser, but every thought within me shifted. I was aware. I saw the patterns. I knew what could come. And eventually, of course, I left - but sadly only after things got much worse.

That day, I realized the power of a speaker. And now... I am that speaker. I get to see that shift happen. I hear it and read it. Victims self-identify. They leave. Survivors feel more validated. People seek help. They heal, rise, and thrive.

I’m blessed to do this work and I’ll continue to do this work. The stakes are too high, and the outcomes are far too life-changing for me to ever possibly forget...

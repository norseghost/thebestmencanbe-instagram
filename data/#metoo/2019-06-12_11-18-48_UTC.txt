Today at Diversity House LeFoot in Paris: stop by for a panel discussion on #MeToo in sport - an important discussion in light of the recent FIFA life ban for the former president of the Afghanistan FA on sexual abuse charges. Come and join us from 6.30pm and check out our women's football exhibition while you are there. üëç#womeninfootball #womensworldcup #fifawomensworldcup

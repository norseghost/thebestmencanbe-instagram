I've only had one #smeartest in my life, and this is the not so cheerful and positive story of that smear test.
Everyone says #smeartestssavelives but one almost took mine. 
Women and people with vaginas should feel free to share their stories of #CervicalScreening even if they aren't positive experiences, there's so much stigma and shame surrounding traumatic smear test experiences, refusal to participate in screening, or sharing an experience that may scare or discourage others from wanting to participate in cervical screening. We need to end that stigma. All women deserve a vocie, all people with vaginas deserve a voice, and deserve a safe space to share their experiences and stories.
Share your less than great smear test experience in the comments, in a DM, or in an email to let someone struggling with smears know they aren't alone.

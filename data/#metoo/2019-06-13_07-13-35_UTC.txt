Open Secrets at Art Basel. I am standing in front of a mind blowing installation by the artist and activist Andrea Bowers documenting the Me Too and Times Up movement. Each strip (there are 200 of them including R Kelly, Harvey Weinstein, Donald Trump and Asia Argento. Yes there are women too) documents the name of the accused, their denial, the accusation and all the details and the public response. It is POWERFUL.

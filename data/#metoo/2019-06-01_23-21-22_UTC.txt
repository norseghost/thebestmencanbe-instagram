Most perpetrators of sexual violence never get prosecuted. According to RAINN, only 9 out of every 230 cases reported to police get referred for prosecution. Eliminating the statute of limitations doesnâ€™t change the burden of proof. It gives a victim who has enough evidence for prosecution an opportunity to do so, regardless of how much time has passed.

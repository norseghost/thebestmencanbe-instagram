"In place of a firing squad, I stare down the barrels of endless interrogation. Why did she not run away? Why did she not use the opportunities she had for escape? Why did she stay if, indeed, the conditions were as bad as she claims?... Sometimes the shame is not the beatings, not the rape. The shaming is being asked to stand to judgement."

This is not a book you enjoy, although Kandasamy's writing style is so beautiful. It's a novel but written from the authors very personal experience and it shows. It's such an important book and if you are someone who has ever asked the question "why didn't she just leave him?" when finding out a woman has been in an abusive relationship, I recommend this book for you. This book is going to stay with me for a long time, it packs a powerful punch. It also doesn't show the woman as a victim, she survived and saved herself and she is really inspirational.

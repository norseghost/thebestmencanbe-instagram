My hearts aches; transience is sweeping motion blurred in moments already fallen away... long before I have the courage to see them, embrace them. 
I breathe, but courage escapes me. It is the emptiness residing in my splintered bone ribcage. My chest quakes, a moment before and after, the moment loves me. The instance, I love it, it falls away from me.

Just breathe. I say to myself and my friends; these are the times, I have nothing, but that which I give.

Breath; to bear witness to the moments of this life that escape; fall away, before reaching, branches, reunite with the roots that grew the lost moment. 
Breathe in, and breathe out; let go--reroot, recenter, release to remember, love is pale pink blossoms, blooming, weeping too, holding space for you.

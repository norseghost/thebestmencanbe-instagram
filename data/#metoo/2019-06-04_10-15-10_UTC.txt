She didn't come here to seduce men. Or get down on both knees. Neither did the others. It's not to say she didn't enjoy it or crave it. But from the first moment she screamed out of her mother's flower it was her choice. If she wanted it and the other part did too, magic was made. But only with consent and passionate love. She loved herself therefore she could love all the others.

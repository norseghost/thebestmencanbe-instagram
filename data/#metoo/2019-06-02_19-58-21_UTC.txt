As promised, 20% of proceeds from the Lost Habitat art show has been donated to RAINN. Today's donation was $220, thanks to your support! 
The show has been taken down, and the donation offer still stands for the three remaining pieces. Message me if you'd like to make a purchase and help survivors. ❤️

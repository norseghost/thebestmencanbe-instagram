Write books about anything (no lie, white fragility is the shit). Its fucking creepy\n.\n\nAnd i love(d?) Anthony Bourdain, but he has a well-oiled history of trend protesting (the #metoo ate him alive. He was out there taking *hard* notes from Asia Argento ...until she was accused of rape, Bourdain personally paid off her accuser; his twitter fell silent, ultimately ending in a suicide -- you can't trend protest. The nuances will literally kill you...)\n.\n\nThe only reason I feel comfortable challenging Random House is bc I've been studying white people since gestation, and they have one move: manipulation (cue Asia Argento) .\n\nIts clear that \"Good\" white people need like, a manual -- a protest starter kit\n.\n\nI might write one\n.\n\nGet into too deep, start seeing white people for \ud83d\udc29\ud83d\udc29WHITE PEOPLE\ud83d\udc29\ud83d\udc29? A mind fuck like no other\n.\n\nAnthony Bourdain seemed to be a good as guy. Incredibly well-intentioned. When you take notes from \"Jenny,\" the morbidly obese race theory professor at NYU who is a *practicing racist*? Well ... It mind fucks the \"good guys\" .\n\nI'm not a not a good guy. I'm perversely honest."

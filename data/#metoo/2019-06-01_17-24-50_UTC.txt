Meet Jen. Forged in the fire of trauma, her desire for justice is unparalleled- the kind that often leaves slit throats and bloody knuckles in her wake. This Avenger of Women is not to be crossed, but in the current state of the world, can she find balance between being (rightly) angry all the time and still living a life?
.
Are you pissed about Americaâ€™s extremist forced-birth laws? So is Jen. Come see the show and scream along with her. Buy tickets to SEVEN in the Hollywood Fringe Festival June 9th, June 22nd, June 30th. Link in bio.

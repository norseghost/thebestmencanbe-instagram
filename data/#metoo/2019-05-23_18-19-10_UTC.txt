When I was involved in @eforallsouthcoast I learned so much about branding, and it has been one of the most complicated pieces for me.  It is like a love affair between you and your dreams.  I’m learning that you cannot attach to it but set it free and see what it attracts. 
There are so many layers.  H2H was developed through the entrepreneur program to gain a larger audience to include those who might be afraid, or who have negative thoughts, feelings or experiences with cannabis.  I was so grateful to @jusoneuw for creating this logo and helping me build all the different pieces using his artwork to guide me through.  Holistic 2 Healing, Inc was awarded $1000.00 from @eforallsouthcoast while working in California. 
As I start my summer courses and start the research portion of the Cannabis Nurse Navigator I am so excited to see where the journey takes me.  And as I am learning each day....
1.  BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD
2.  DON’T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY
3.  DON’T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS
4.  ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST

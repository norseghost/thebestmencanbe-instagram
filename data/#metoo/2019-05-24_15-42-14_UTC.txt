#MoviesandHer | Queen as you settle into the weekend, here's another movie recommendation for you! #3idiots is one light hearted movie that's entertaining and educative with various important life lessons!

The #Bollywood movie touches on the importance of friendship (the company you keep), having the courage to face your problems and chase your dreams as well as our most important take away from the movie - No matter how bad things get, take a deep breath and be assured that "All is Well". The movie was released in 2009 but it's that movie you should have in your collection. Highly Recommend.

People find all types of ways to hide from their situation. Covering their plight with a “happy face” or avoidance. Perhaps, acting more (or less) normal than you’d expect so you wouldn’t expect anything. What are some signs to look for? Here are five... 1. Overtly sexualized nature.
2. Tired or exhausted behavior.
3. Missing more classes or assignments than normal.
4. Over-the-top exaggerations about lifestyle. 
5. Withdrawal or becoming more quiet.

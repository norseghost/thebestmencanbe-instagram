By nature I’m a lot of things: unfiltered, compassionate, anxious, kind, energetic, and very private-especially about my struggles. I’m lucky enough where I truly have amazing friends so at points in my life when I needed support I’d go to them and work through it, but I’ve never been one to share about my anxiety, or insecurities, or struggles with self image + ED on social media. Those are very intimate topics for me. .
In the age of social media I think that it’s way to easy to over share. Let’s be real we all have those people we follow for the drama. But this platform would be better used if we got real, open, and shared our stories + then lifted each other up. .
My struggles aren’t exclusive to me. My best friends have felt the same pain, blogs I follow have similar stories, and I’m willing to bet some of you do too. .
I guess this is all to say hi my name is Lindsey and I speak before I think, I over analyze a lot, I get nervous about what I perceive others to think when it shouldn’t matter, and I work hard to have a positive self image. If this sounds like you, join me in building a community so we can figure out life together, or at least laugh about it

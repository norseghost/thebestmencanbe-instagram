“This was a labour of love and heartbreak. Thanks to all who agreed to be interviewed for the research. My love and gratitude to an amazing cast, director and @pangdemoniumtheatre team who brought it to life and packed the room for its run. The discussion mustn’t end here, more needs to be done so survivors get the help they need, and our children are raised right. #thisiswhathappenstoprettygirls #metooplay #metoo” - Ken Kwek, Playwright

THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO PRETTY GIRLS concludes tonight. A big thank you to all who have supported us through this run!

@tcg_gram is bringing me to their national conference in Miami, Florida next week! I'll be leading a TCG Lab on the #MeToo movement in theatre, leading an affinity space for Trans/nonbinary attendees, and  sitting on a panel discussing advocacy practices in the theatre. I’m thrilled to be part of such an incredible line up!

How is it possible that this little spitfire of mine is graduating KINDERGARTEN tomorrow?!?! 🙀🥰 .

People with older kids always advised me, “don’t blink, they will be older and bigger before you know it.” I was always so annoyed by that advice. Of course my kids would get bigger. But holy cow, if you don’t live with your eyes wide open and enjoy every moment, you will miss it all! Anyone else feel the same? ✨ .

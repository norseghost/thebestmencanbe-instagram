HR professionals and business owners, we are acutely aware of the Equality Act 2010 and the protected characteristics of individuals. That is, the unfair treatment of an individual because of their age, race, religion, sex, sexuality, disability, maternity/paternity or marital/civil partnership status.⠀
⠀
Have you spotted the missing characteristic? Class.⠀
⠀
Why isn’t class defined as a protected characteristic? Could this be why unconscious bias towards working class employees remains? And perhaps why tackling social inequality and encouraging social mobility continues to be a lower-level priority on the workplace agenda?

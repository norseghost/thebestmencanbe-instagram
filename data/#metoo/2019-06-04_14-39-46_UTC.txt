Spirit of a WINNER. Reposted from @hernetworkonline -  #HerMCM | Despite #AnthonyJoshua's loss to #AndyRuizjr over the weekend, His positive approach is inspiring and a definite mood. A setback isn't the end of the world. Life is a Journey.

In His Words - "I‚Äôve dealt with some real big losses and I‚Äôve bounced back. Life is a journey. This is boxing.

What I have to do is re-evaluate the situation, make it better and we go again.

We didn‚Äôt come this far to stop, we didn‚Äôt come this far to fold under pressure. We came this far and I definitely feel like we can go a lot further.‚Äù

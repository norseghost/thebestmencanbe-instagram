I started this account to help keep myself accountable while attempting to regain my healthy lifestyle after our move. To also be honest about my personal struggles in life as a survivor of sexual abuse. It may make some people uncomfortable but it’s my story and it has affected my life considerably. I was silent for too long, and in the process protected and enabled my abuser at the expense of my own mental well being. —
Most days I am ok and can continue through life like a “normal” person and then... there are days where I feel triggered. I disassociate and I self sabotage. I feel suffocated and it takes every ounce of will power to do anything. My journey to wellness isn’t JUST a vain attempt to lose weight or getting into old clothes. It’s about overcoming negative coping mechanisms I spent YEARS using to deal with the repercussions of abuse. This weekend I have struggled. Struggled with the idea that my abuser gets to continue living his life unaffected with the people I love while I have to constantly pick up my pieces. So here I am, picking up my messy pieces and trying to remember I don’t have to punish myself. I can live a healthy life and treat my body with kindness and grace despite it all. —

Many people have been ridiculed, beaten, jailed or murdered because they spoke truth to power.\u2800\n\u2800\nSome of the most famous names in history are those of people who choose to confront those in authority about injustices instead of meekly standing by.\u2800\n\u2800\nNames such as Gandhi, Mandela, King and every woman who has come out during the #Metoo movement has had to face negativity and dire consequences of their chosen actions.\u2800\n\u2800\nTo speak truth to power means to stand up to those in authority, confront them with current injustices and demand a moral response. It involves much personal risk and possibly in extreme cases, the loss of one\u2019s freedom or life.\u2800\n\u2800\nIf speaking truth to power is so hard, why do people do it?\u2800\n\u2800\nWell, they feel they have to, I suppose. Why did Gandhi lead the people on a march to the sea to make salt?\u2800\n\u2800\nSometimes civil disobedience is the only way to make those in authority understand how serious the injustice is.\u2800\n\u2800\nOn Gandhi\u2019s march somewhere around 60,000 people were arrested.\u2800\n\u2800\nImagine, they wanted to be able to make salt for themselves. They were banned from letting seawater evaporate to get the salt left behind.\u2800\n\u2800\nThe act itself may seem small, but it\u2019s the principle of the matter which is essential.\u2800\n\u2800\nNelson Mandela spent 27 years in prison for speaking truth to power against apartheid.\u2800\n\u2800\nHe was a nonviolent activist, yet he was seen as such a threat to the government who wanted to maintain the status quo that they had to lock him away for 27 years.\u2800\n\u2800\nOf course, these people are the ultimate examples when we talk of speaking truth to power.\u2800\n\u2800\nBut when people are abused at work or face unfair conditions, they face the same fear when they try to speak up and confront their injustices.\u2800\n\u2800\nIt takes a brave person to speak truth to power.\u2800\n#artisanenglish.jp #Englishphrase #\u82f1\u4f1a\u8a71 #\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u82f1\u4f1a\u8a71 #\u548c\u6b4c\u5c71\u2800\n#\u82f1\u8a9e\u306e\u5148\u751f #\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30ba #\u82f1\u8a9e #English\u2800\n#\u30cd\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306e\u82f1\u8a9e #\u82f1\u4f1a\u8a71\u6559\u5ba4 #\u82f1\u8a9e\u306e\u52c9\u5f37 #\u82f1\u4f1a\u8a71\u57a2 #\u82f1\u8a9e\u52c9\u5f37\u4e2d\u2800\n#phrase #\u82f1\u8a9e\u52c9\u5f37 #\u82f1\u8a9e\u8868\u73fe #vocab #speaktruthtopower"

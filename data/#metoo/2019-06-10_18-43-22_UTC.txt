Trauma can make one feel as though their own body is an unsafe place.  Especially for those who have survived sexual violence, because the violation and trauma happened to their body. One can feel constantly “on edge” and develop a heightened startle response.  Therapy can help to “re-wire” the brain and learn how to feel safe again, without reliving or necessarily retelling a trauma narrative.  #traumatherapy #chicagotherapists #endrapeculture #healingjourney #arttherapy #groundingtechniques #ptsd #survivor #metoo #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare

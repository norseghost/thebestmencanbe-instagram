When I\u2019d bump into him at nights out after if I was alone he\u2019d always refuse to leave me until my friends reappeared and then he\u2019d still hang around on the outskirts. Then one night I had an end of season dinner, got pretty drunk and ended up blacking out. My last memory of the night was arriving at the union after the dinner and then I woke up the next morning in his bed with none of my belongings knowing that I had definitely had sex with him again. Not saying I was necessarily raped but it definitely made me think that on previous nights he\u2019d just been hanging around waiting for me to get in a bad enough state where he could easily get me to go home with him again\u201d\n#ournakedtruth #speakout #metoo #universitysexualassault #prochoice #sexualassault #brave #fightback #speakup #nomeansno #standtogether #anonymousconfessions"

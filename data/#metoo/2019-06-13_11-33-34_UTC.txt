This is the theme of my life right now. I’m at a place where I’m finally facing all the pain and fear from childhood sexual abuse trauma.  I’m starting to recognize things that trigger anxiety for me are all somehow related to emotional flashbacks of what happened to me. That so much of my current self is still so effected by these events that happened so long ago. Talking about it all with a therapist makes it real again and I noticed the first thing I did when I’d leave therapy is eat something horrible for me. This makes total sense because as a child, it was my coping skill. I gained 40 pounds the year my abuse started. I learned that being heavy also made me invisible to most people and I liked flying under the radar. I wore the extra weight like a literal coat of armor. Being the fat kid came with it’s own set of emotional challenges. The weight I found comfort in I was suddenly being bullied for by mean kids at school. It’s a terrible feeling as a girl to want to be pretty but to fear it more. I’m trying to make better choices and recognize my desire to reach for junk food after therapy is a learned response. I just have to redirect that feeling into something more beneficial for me.

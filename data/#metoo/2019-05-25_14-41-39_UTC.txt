Just a few more pics and thoughts from the other night at #itinerant. The title of the piece is ‚Äúa cutting in.‚Äù The term, cutting in, is a baking term of combining flour with a fat such as butter, lard, or shortening. The flour in this piece was meant as a way for me to blend into the wall (therefore disappear)- one type of defense mechanism- and then work with the other defense mechanism, fat. I built it around an area I have felt vulnerable and throughout the performance worked to keep it there. As it heated up from my body heat, it became more and more difficult to hold, thus, the implication of how how difficult it is to maneuver throughout a healing process without being noticed. It‚Äôs overwhelming, all consuming. I bobbed as if to comfort a baby but instead am,in a way, self soothing this new entity of fear, sadness, and anger. That bobbing moved the lard throughout my body truly changing my silhouette and therefore how I would no longer look quite like myself. 
I hope to compile a short video to share. We‚Äôll see. üì∏: @adrianofarinella üì∏: @greymelissa (final image)

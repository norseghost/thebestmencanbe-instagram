Here I am, E.J. Moran, visiting the Piazza del Duomo - one of the breath-taking places Anna spent hours wandering through. Below is a passage of Anna meandering through the famous square:

Sunday had arrived, a day she had to herself, and despite the gloomy weather she ventured out and walked over to Piazza Del Duomo, featuring Milan’s magnificent Cathedral. After spending more than an hour wandering around the centuries-old gothic structure, she wandered back through the throng of people in the enormous Italian square and headed down a side street leading toward the area of town she lived in.
A passing red Ferrari slowed down and pulled up alongside her. “Ciao, bella!”
Anna turned to see a stylish young blonde Italian man in designer sunglasses behind the wheel. She had no interest in starting up a conversation with the guy, even if he did have a Ferrari.
“Why is a beautiful lady like you alone on a Sunday afternoon?” he said in heavily accented English. A notorious playboy, experience convinced him she was a foreign fashion model. They all had a certain look.
Anna didn’t know what to say. She was very uncomfortable and sensed he was leering at her with longing and desire in his eyes, something that seemed to happen to her a lot during her first week in Milan. “I enjoy being alone,” she said sharply in Italian. She continued to look straight ahead with the hopes that he would get the message and go away.
“You are very beautiful,” he continued, completely taken aback by her use of Italian. He had never come across a model who spoke his language so well. All the models roaming the city were either American, Finnish or Swedish, and they all communicated in English. “Can I take you for a coffee?”
“No thanks,” she said. Oh no, he’s not going away. Now what do I do?

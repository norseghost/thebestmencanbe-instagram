(Shout out @drdenamichele )!\ud83d\udddd\n..\nIt got me thinking about how I used to think I was the crazy one because sometimes, I would go completely off the chain in reaction to the things my abuser said and did.\n..\nIn those moments I truly felt like I couldn\u2019t control myself; like this dark, ominous entity called toxicity was trying to eat away my soul and I was powerless to stop it.\n..\nI questioned myself often, wondering if I was maybe mentally ill or incapable of proper mindsets to really live life correctly...I felt stuck, wondering if I was just damaged goods.\n..\nHonestly, when you\u2019re in an abusive situation, oftentimes you will mirror the toxicity of your abuser - this comes out as a defense mechanism in response to the levels two and three stress hormones you are experiencing when someone mistreats you.\n..\nYou\u2019re not crazy, but if you\u2019re not aware of what is happening, you may become the very thing you are battling against. This will make you feel crazy - because you didn\u2019t start out like that, and when the abuse isn\u2019t present, you know you\u2019re a different person. ..\nThe good news is that it\u2019s not a mental illness to respond to toxicity with toxicity - it\u2019s an improper response that can be unlearned with a little daily focused thinking and a lot of determination to rise above and take control of your emotions. ..\nJust choose to respond to toxicity differently. You can do it! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udc51"

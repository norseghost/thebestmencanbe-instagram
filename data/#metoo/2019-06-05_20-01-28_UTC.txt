NEW PODCAST! It was a pleasure interviewing entrepreneur and lawyer Sara Forte. We had an engaging conversation on entrepreneurship, ambition and sexual harassment at work (what it is, what employees can do, what employers can do and what bystanders can do). Take a listen at the link in bio or search womendontdothat wherever podcasts are found. @myrrhanda

Curiosity level: How much will you give up to be a free woman?
.
“This book that has resulted from my strange, selfish but nonetheless urgent quest to understand freedom...”
.
In this non-fic read, Lara writes ‘freely’ about her thoughts on freedom, with Doris Lessing’s work (The Golden Notebook 📒) as her steady companion. I haven’t read Lessing’s books yet, but was happy to know more through this work of literary scholarship. Lara explores what it means to be a free woman 👩🏻 The ugly, the good, and the bad.
.
It’s a really modern read and though I was greatly uncomfortable with many of the ideas (especially “free love”) in it, what kept me spellbound was the author’s sheer honesty, and vulnerability, as well as her wonderfully compelling writing. Recommended for the searching, open-minded females who are ready to embrace new notions of freedom and to relook at old ones. 📸: @vektaursaurus

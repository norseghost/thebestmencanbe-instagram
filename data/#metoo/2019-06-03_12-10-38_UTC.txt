The trail isn’t always pretty...it’s a compressed slice of real life that allows us to process in a different environment and way.  News came to me earlier this week that a man I had hiked with in VA has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman on the trail.  As a survivor of sexual abuse it has hit me incredibly hard, and I’ve thought about just going home.  I am wrestling with my insecurities, my fears, my instincts, my shame, my humility and feelings of general self worth. They are all emotions that come with being abused.  This history NEVER leaves us behind, and can be triggered at any moment by anything.  I thought I would save you the ugly crying face, and substitute it with a simple picture of my pack.  This is how to I will continue to heal and process all that has and continues to happen.  If you question at all the power of nature therapy, I beg of you not to...for some of us it is the thread that holds us together.  Thank you @_grizel_ for role modeling strong behavior and allowing me to share this publicly.  I don’t need to live with shame and embarrassment any more.

Feminism isnâ€™t tripping the scale in the other direction to make women superior to men, usurping the authority or position of men or a fight against men. Feminism simply means equal consideration, value and favour given to the different behavior, aspiration and needs of both women and men. It means equal rights, access and opportunities for both genders.

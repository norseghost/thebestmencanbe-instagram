A very personal post for me but I’m proud so ima share it. Finally for once in my life I am truly and genuinely happy. I have spent the last year and half to two years in therapy and I had my last appointment yesterday. I worked my butt off to work through toxic relationships/friendships and five years of assault. I’m proud of how far I’ve come and I am actually looking forward to my future. #metoo #mentalheath

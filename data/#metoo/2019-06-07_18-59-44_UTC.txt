*10 of Swords portrayed in this children's book "Squeakers" - Stabbed in the back or fear of recriminations from a relationship.

Look at Squeakers' fur in the hands of the bad mole! That mole stole something very personal and serious from our lovely friend. "Remember, little squirrel, don't tell anyone about this!" he cautions.

What will our little friend do? 
Nobody had a right to hurt us. These are difficult challenges we must overcome, to avoid the lessons swinging back around.

Sending courage and love to you, to all of us who deal with bullies.

Squeakers' by Stephen Cosgrove, illustrated by Robin James

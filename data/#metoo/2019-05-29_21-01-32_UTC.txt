“Polaris is named for the North Star, which people held in slavery in the United States used as a guide to navigate their way toward freedom. Today [Polaris is] filling in the roadmap for that journey and lighting the path ahead.” We’re excited to announce our new partnership with the Polaris Project, which works to help human trafficking victims through cross-collaboration among organizations working to alleviate the suffering of human trafficking victims and put an end to human trafficking.

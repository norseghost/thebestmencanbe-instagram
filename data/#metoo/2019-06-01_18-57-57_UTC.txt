It was a very hard and embarrassing time in my life but I am so fortunate to have gotten out and be where I am today. ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’• #metoo #abusiverelationship #domesticviolence #emotionalabuse #toxicrelationships #domesticviolenceawareness #abusesurvivor #abuseawareness #narcissisticabusesurvivor #verbalabuse #ifmywoundswerevisible #speakup #emotionalabuseisstillabuse

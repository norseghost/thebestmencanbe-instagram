When your abuse runs together
Wondering whose hands run across your body tonight
Peeling your skin back
Exposing your innocence 
The multi fingered abuse
Brother
Lover
Stranger
Friend
Self
Mother
My abuse has not been selective
The many masked beast
That held me when I was born
Embedding in me the self hatred and guilt needed
To be easily coaxed into grabbing
The fingers
Being led into the dark mines
Digging my own grave 
I have walked into this life
To heal Ancient lines of silent suffering
Crawling through the narrow passageways 
Of bat covered darkness
I have crawled to understand 
To know the narrative
To see what must be done
Born to the deadliest viper
Fangs waiting when I hoisted myself 
Out of the belly of the beast 
I fight
Born into this with sword and shield
Skin like wildfire
A heart of burning suns
And I fight
I fight for the freedom 
Of taking up space
Of rejecting the silent suffering
Brother
Lover
Stranger
Friend
Self
Mother
I fight to rewrite
Reclaim
I do not go willingly 
Anymore

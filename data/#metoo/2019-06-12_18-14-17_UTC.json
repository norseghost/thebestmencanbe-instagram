That closeness, that bond.\n.\nThe main characters, Tiffy and Leon, feel real. They\u2019re not airbrushed perfection (I love how Tiffy is described as being \u2018big\u2019 however this isn\u2019t mentioned too much, it\u2019s just part of who she is so doesn\u2019t feel patronising and isn\u2019t overplayed) and Leon isn\u2019t the perfect hero.\n.\nI\u2019m sure most got caught up in what was happening with Tiffy and Leon, but honestly I was more interested in Tiffy\u2019s relationship with her ex-boyfriend and what was happening to Leon\u2019s brother.\n.\nI don\u2019t want to give too much away but I felt this was a good exploration of control and manipulation. Gaslighting has become such a hot topic, particularly in the #metoo movement, and this is the first novel I\u2019ve read that really explores this in a relatable way.\n.\nAs for Leon\u2019s brother, I actually write about what happened to him for a living so I was very intrigued by this and let\u2019s just say the state our legal system in is shocking and I highly recommend people read The Secret Barrister to find out more.\n.\n@betholearyauthor's talent as a writer is to absorb what\u2019s going on in society around her, and write about it in such an easy to digest and sensitive way. And I think that\u2019s why the Flatshare is so special. \nThank you to @hannah_is_reading\nfor this copy, I loved it.\n.\n#theflatshare #betholeary"

Rachael Denhollander asked this question during the gymnastics sexual abuse trial.  This continues to be a valid question as we watch some States attempt to sends a message that says otherwise.  Their message might seem to be saying, “not a lot”. I disagree.  I believe our girls and women are worth a hell of a lot ~ and definitely worth the fight!💜

•It’s been 6 years since I met you. •It’s been just over 2 years since God saved me from you and I escaped.
•It’s also been 2 years since I made the hardest decision of my life; to prosecute you in the hope of saving other lives.
•It’s been less than 1.5 years since I had my 3rd and final surgery because of what you did to me. •It’s been 0 days since I decided I finally have the strength and the courage to forgive you. •I will never forget what you did to me, what you said to me, what you said and STILL say about me that’s not the truth, how your family continued to support and encourage you and your behavior, and I will never forget the looks you gave me in court that sent shivers up and down my spine, and they still do.
•I’ll never have the pleasure of forgetting you entirely, but I will have the pleasure of finding peace in my heart by letting go of the ultimate hate and rage I felt and still feel towards you. Your sins aren’t worth God not forgiving me of my own sins because I don’t forgive you. So today, I’m finally cracking open this book. Today, I’m letting you go. Today I’m allowing my heart to find peace and to forgive you. •Matthew 6:14 “For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others of their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins”. ❤️ #forgiveness #forgive #domesticviolencesurvivor#metoo #nomore #jesuslovesyou #biblequotes #lettinggo

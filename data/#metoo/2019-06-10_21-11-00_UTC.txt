🚫 I will not be bullied, and I will not tolerate abuse on my page.🚫 ❌❌❌@guerillawarfare26 👈🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼 ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Trigger Warning: Graphic Images/Content, particularly upsetting to victims of sexual abuse. ⚠️⚠️⚠️ •
My stomach is churning, and my hands are shaking as I write this. This is not the kind of content I want associated with my social media or career, but I feel it is important to share so that it does not happen to me again, or that other women fall victim to the same abuser. I do not accept the harassment of online predators, and I will not sit back quietly, and encourage sex offenders to hide behind screens without consequence. Let it be known, if you sexually harass me, the world WILL KNOW about it. This pervert chose to use social media as a weapon, so now, I will use my account to expose him.

Friday night I received a message from an unknown account, associated with the name TOM LANDRY with the account username @guerillawarfare26 or https://www.instagram.com/guerillawarfare26. This is not uncommon, I occasionally receive friendly messages from "fans" who've seen me on the shows and movies I have been in. However, this message was sinister, violating, and deeply upsetting. He sent me unsolicited messages and pictures of himself masturbating to MY PHOTOS. Photos from my Instagram that are NO LONGER AVAILABLE, and deleted months ago. This means he has had these photos for only God knows how long, saved them, and I believe he created this account to contact, harass and frighten me.

Please share his profile, repost this, share it. Let him know that there are consequences for his actions. I have reported his profile to law enforcement. Be safe, be vigilant, and report this kind of abuse. ❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️

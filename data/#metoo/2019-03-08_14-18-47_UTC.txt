“A woman with a voice is by definition, a strong woman.”
. “I wish more women realized that helping another woman win, cheering her on, praying for her or sharing a resource with her, does NOT take away from the blessings coming to them. In fact, the more you give, the more you receive. Empowering women doesn’t come from selfishness but rather from selflessness.” .

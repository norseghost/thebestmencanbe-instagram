Hi! I’m Jenn and I am going through some shit. I’m a #writer, #photographer and #mother who just had #vsg 1 week ago. This picture is from 1 day #postop. I am #barreling toward #40, a #divorce, an international move and #gradschool. This is where I will share the good, the bad and the ugly. I’d love it if you followed me! #vsgcommunity #vsgjourney #bariatricsurgery #bariatricbabe #wls #wlscommunity #artist #writersofinstagram #writerscommunity #divorce #boybye #thankyounext #notyourbabe #metoo #timesup #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #endthestigma

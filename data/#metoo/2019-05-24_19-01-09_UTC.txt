Sneak peak ðŸ‘€ at an upcoming @snydersuttonrealestate listing! The raddest creekside cottage you ever did see, almost 100 years old! The stables have been converted into, you guessed it, a super funky guest house. This home screams Topanga. And you can walk to @topangadays from here! I leased this home last year but it will be listed for sale next week. Call me for more details or to set up a showing. Listed by Sarah Sutton + Drew Snyder.

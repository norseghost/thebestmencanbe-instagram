This is men's mental health week. The stats around men's mental health is heart wrenching at best. 
And ladies, men's mental health is just as much our issue as it is theirs. We can't just ask them to support us in things like #Metoo unless we take a stand and support them. 
The suicide rate of men in Australia is up by 10%, that is, this week alone, roughly 45 men will take their own lives. 
In my observation, one of the causes of this is the Masculine culture of, it is weakness to speak up, ask for help or show emotions. This Bullsh!t has to change. 
Being vulnerable and asking for help takes courage and strength.Â  Emotions are part of being human.Â We need to start making this our culture.

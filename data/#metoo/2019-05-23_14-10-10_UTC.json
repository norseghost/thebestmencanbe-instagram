But here and there I check my daily horoscope overview too. Today\u2019s said to focus on \u201cbelieving in myself\u201d. I have been doubting myself a bit over the past few weeks, so the horoscope shined a light at the right time. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhy is it so hard to believe in ourselves? We believe in others or not believe in them so quickly...but what about US? Prioritize yourself in your relationship with yourself. You are stuck in this relationship forever! \u2063\ud83d\udc9f\n\u2063\nSo I started to think where can I improve my thinking and make an effort to believe in myself? I needed to stop doubting myself, stop negative thoughts, stop dramatic thoughts, stop putting all my energy into other people. Like I said earlier this month, just this awareness is already a step forward. \u2063\u262f\ufe0f\n\u2063\nI randomly was scrolling through my phone and saw my Affirmations App. I decided to click on it, which I haven\u2019t done in weeks. Guess what the affirmation said? \u201cI shine brightest when I believe in myself!\u201d WOW. Is that just coincidence? I don\u2019t think so, I call it law of attraction. My perspective shifted and all of the sudden the universe was showing me signs. \u2063\n\u2063\nIf you need this daily reminder, I am telling you to believe in yourself. When others believe in you it feels good, but when you believe in yourself it feels GREAT. Think about the last time you said to yourself \u201cI believe in myself and I can accomplish anything I put my mind to.\u201d \u2063\ud83d\udd49"

The stronger I feel the more I am drawn to help others.

I told my mom today that after what I have been through itâ€™s like I have spidey senses when it comes to toxic and harmful people or behavior. ++ the vibes donâ€™t lie.

I know what I share can be uncomfortable for some to read and if youâ€™ve been around a while you know I do limited sugar coating on the stuff I post.

But I post these things because I know in my heart someone somewhere needs to read it. I know that as much fulfillment and greatness this business brings to my life I was put here for more. I experienced what I did and were dealt these cards to help others fight + not feel alone.

To help them demand and fight for better and believe that if they trust in themselves they can break free from the chains of abuse. 
I remember thinking life was hopeless; I remember thinking this was just the way it was.

I just want...shit need you to feel the joys of freedom and happiness. I want you to know this is possible. I want you to know I am here for you and am rooting for you.

You can do this. YOU are DOING IT! ðŸ–¤âœ¨ âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨
ps: I totally hid my broken pinky nail taking this selfie thatâ€™s more for me than you ðŸ¤“ #keepingitreal

❔Burning questions — Part 2❔

This series will explore the questions that keep me up at night. When I feel like I’ve finally come to some answers with regards to my history, more unanswerable questions leap into my mind. I want to write them down to make them stop spinning for a second. Are there any questions that keep churning in your mind? You can submit these and I’ll letter them as a companion to this series. Thanks for reading ♥️

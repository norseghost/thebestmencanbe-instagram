Day 1 of my yoga program went down this morning and though I’m a bit mortified by my before pics, I know there’s no where to go but UP and it felt OHM-MAZING with a gentle breeze before it got stupid HOT today! Lol. Wireless earbuds from @mucro_headphones and my wonderful online instructor @vytasyoga made my outside practice SUPER easy!! I didn’t hardly even have to look at my phone because is instructions are so clear!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

I’m doing a total body strengthening program too (both programs have 30 min. workouts so it’s only 1 hour total), but today is plyo and that kind of cardio is still a no no for my back/hip issues. So I chugged some #LiquidGold  because um... well... it’s summer and I have 5 children 🤷🏽‍♀️, and walked to the library for my cardio today. Yay to day 1/42 of #SUMMERSHAPEUP with #TeamNourish BAE-BAY!! 💪🏽 Clips in my stories! .

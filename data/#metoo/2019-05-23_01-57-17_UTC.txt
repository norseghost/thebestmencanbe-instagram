Let’s talk about responding to disclosures!⠀
⠀
Hearing a disclosure can be difficult, especially when it’s someone that you care about. Here are some things to say to be as supportive and non-judgmental as possible:⠀
“Thank you for telling me.”⠀
“I believe you.”⠀
“It wasn’t your fault.”⠀
“I’m here for you”⠀
“What is the best way that I can support you right now?”⠀
“Can I help you find some resources?”⠀
⠀
While there is no correct or normal way to respond to someone when they disclose, let’s also talk about some things that can be hurtful for someone to hear:⠀
“It’s not that big of a deal. You’re overreacting.”⠀
“You’re being dramatic.”⠀
“You were wearing _________ so you must’ve been asking for it.”⠀
“Let’s go report right now.”⠀
“That person is too nice to do something like that”⠀
“You were drunk/high and probably just don’t remember saying yes.”⠀
“You don’t remember it so it probably didn’t even happen.”⠀
⠀
Some helpful resources could be knowing where your local sexual violence support agency is located and their contact information. Otherwise, @rainn has a 24-hour online chat feature and hotline staffed with people who are trained to respond to sexual violence.⠀

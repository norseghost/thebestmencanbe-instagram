“All Veterans are welcome at VA, even those who identify as a sexual or gender minority.” Even those. The language in this article, to some, might indicate that members of the LGBTQ community are viewed differently than other veterans seeking services. Have you, or someone you know, experienced anything less than premium service from the VA? Tell us about it. We want to hear from you. If you don’t feel comfortable leaving us a public comment feel free to drop us a private DM.

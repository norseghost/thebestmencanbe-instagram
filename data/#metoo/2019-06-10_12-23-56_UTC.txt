When you think of sexual assault you never imagine it happening to you. Then one day it does. The night I was sexually assaulted was also the night I lost my virginity 
I was barely 18 when I was sexually assaulted. I went through stages of shock, sadness, anger, and acceptance. I even blamed myself for what happened until my close friends told me that I said no and that sexual assault is never the victims fault. There was a period of time where I couldn’t even look at a man without feeling sick to my stomach or scared that someone else would do this to me again in the future. I made an effort to share my story with girls I knew because I never want this to happen to them. I was surprised and sad to hear that similar experiences had also happened to a few of my close friends and even my mom was almost sexually assaulted when she was my age. 
Even though I never reported my sexual assault to the police I now wish that I had. I was too afraid to ever see his face again and I let that stop me from protecting other girls he might hurt in the future. I unfortunately ran into him on a a few separate occasions because he went to my university. Every time I saw him I relived that night and suffered from frequent nightmares and flashbacks for almost a year. 
I had to learn how to trust men again and through the strength that God gave me I was able to do that. He also blessed me with the most wonderful man who loves me and protects me. 
If you’re struggling with something like this right now please know that you’re not alone and that 1 out of every 6 American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime. If you have been sexually assaulted I urge you to seek support from friends and/or family. I truly believe that seeking comfort in the Lord, family, and friends is what helped me get through that difficult time in my life.

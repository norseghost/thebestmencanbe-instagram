SWIPE for details! @wethefemale_official : Our mission is to inspire American women to embrace and defend their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness through self-defense and security education. 🖤

AZFirearms welcomes nationally known speaker Kerry Slone ✨ to Arizona for an evening of training and education in situational awareness and personal defense. 💪 Because no one should ever be a victim. There is no charge for this class; however, if you'd like to support the mission of the We The Female organization, a tax-deductible donation of $30 or more grants you one of the highly sought after We The Female t-shirts! 🔥 * While this class will have female-specific information, everyone is welcome! 🤓 * Children capable of sitting through the class are welcome! 💫

Well, I can't ignore it anymore.  My hair is falling out, and I have to do something about it.

Over the last 7 years or so, persistent stress and malnutrition (also related to stress) has taken a serious toll on my body.  My skin and hair have suffered the worst, but I feel it in my whole body.
I used to take vitamins and eat well, but I suffered a core-damaging trauma awhile back, and since I have struggled to get back to myself.  I developed an eating disorder, and exacerbated existing avoiding behavior to the point that I stopped being able to consistently care about myself.

Last night, as I was throwing out yet another handful of what used to be beautiful, thick hair, I started to cry.  I let an absolute troll of a person take away my sense of self and care for my well-being for way too long, and goddammit he didn't deserve that kind of attention *before* he showed me what a piece of shit he is.

Fuck that.  He gets no more space to poison me.  It's time to nourish and meditate his bitch ass out of my body for good!  #ptsd #hairloss #ptsdsymptoms #depression #anxiety #traumarecovery #mentalillness #ptsdawareness #metoo #iwanttogetbetter #avoidingisnottheanswer #selfcare #selfharm #ptsdrecovery #stressispoison #edrecovery #metoomovement #recovery

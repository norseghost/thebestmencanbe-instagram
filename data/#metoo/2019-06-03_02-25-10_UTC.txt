I needed to finally write this out. It’s been bothering me for years and writing is my therapy. This is trauma that stays in my mind every day while he gets to walk around without a care in the world. So here goes... .
.
I was 20, in Italy on a night out, I wanted to dance and drink. I remember being surprised by his presence. A familiar face, in a crowd of strangers. He walked me outside, he knew I very rarely drank, and how drunk I was. I slurred my words while I spoke about my boy back in Melbourne. A boy he was friendly with but obviously didn’t approve of. I remember going on about vomiting earlier in the night and how badly I needed to pee. He said he lived close by.
.
I didn’t think much of it. I needed to pee, he offered me a place to pee.... Then things get fuzzy. It felt like the longest walk to his place. I vaguely remember walking over old bridges, and down cobble stone roads. .
.
I don’t remember what the house looked like or how we got to the room. I do remember a bed in attic, with a bathroom. I could finally pee. .
I wanted to sleep. I remember him kissing me, I said I didn’t want to have sex when he asked and I don’t know if we did ...as the rest is blank. .
.
I woke up naked. He was sitting in a leather chair, doing work. Apparently he didn’t sleep. I couldn’t find my undies, I ran to the bathroom needing to vomit again. .
.
I had no idea where I was. I was so confused. I asked him to walk me to a cab, reluctantly he did. .
I needed to understand what happened. He was my friend and that’s what I wanted to believe. “It must of been okay.” I told myself that over and over again. .
.
A few weeks later, still confused and uncomfortable. I asked him what happened. He gave me some vague response then became cold and distant. I still tried to be his friend. I didn’t want this to be real... Did he know what he did was wrong? .
It took me months to realise that night was not okay. .

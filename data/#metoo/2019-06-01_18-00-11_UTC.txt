#LenaWaithe follows up via our thread on Twitter (@blkgrlmasculine). We will continue to reinforce love with accountability, especially with Queer, Masc Family. We’ve gotten a ton of feedback on the post, asking why we chose to hold @lenawaithe accountable the way we have, instead of directing more of our attention to @jasonmitchellactor. Listen, we are not surprised that another man has exposed himself as a sexual predator, but we are deeply hurt by the lack of action taken by Lena, a very outspoken #metoo activist with a vast Queer platform. Holding Waithe accountable meant serving our community, much of whom looks up to Waithe and her work. Waithe responds holding it all, and we hope to continue to see her combat mediocre excuses that minimize the impact of her decisions, to be a reflection of intentional accountability and healing in and outside of our community. Áse. We are sending love to #tiffanyboone and #ayannafloyd constantly. We see you. We support you. We love you.

How a survivor copes can dramatically affect their recovery process. But it is important to remember there are multiple factors that go into a survivor’s coping mechanisms. A survivor shouldn’t be shamed for not “coping effectively,” but instead should be supported & encouraged to seek more healthy means of coping on their own time and terms. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

It can be extremely difficult to not get caught up thinking “why did this happen to me?” after sexual assault or abuse. We may find ourselves trying to find a meaning or reason explaining why something so traumatic happened to us. We may wonder what we did to deserve this. This harmful way of thinking creates a cycle of self-blame & can make it impossible to move forward. Please remember, you did nothing to deserve this. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

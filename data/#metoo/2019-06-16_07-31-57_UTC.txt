#sexkitten "#gloriasteinem first came across the radar of Black men in #1978 when Steinem put a book called “#BlackMacho and the #Myth of the #Superwoman” on the cover of #MsMagazine, the magazine which she controlled. The book was “written” by a #Blackfeminist
 and “activist” named #MiceleWallace who came out of nowhere. Wallace was in her early twenties at the time, yet she was being touted as the “leader” of Black feminism. In the book, Wallace called abolitionists like #HarrietTubman and #SojounerTruth “#ugly” and “#stupid” for supporting #Blackmen. She called #BlackRevolutionaries" #chauvinistmachopigs” and advised Black women to “#goitalone.” #GloriaSteinem said that Wallace’s book would “define the future of Black relationships” and she pushed hard to make sure the book received massive publicity. Gloria Steinem’s work triggered a flood of “Hate Black Men” books and films that continues to this day. Needless to say, some were quite suspicious of Ms. Magazine and Gloria Steinem. Why was Steinem sticking her nose into the affairs of the Black community? So people started doing some research on Steinem. When it came out that Gloria Steinem was probably the ghost writer of the book with Michele Wallace’s name on it, Wallace had a nervous breakdown and went into hiding for two years. However, the damage was already done and the “Hate Black Men” movement was off and running. But the research into Gloria Steinem’s background continued. What follows is the findings of many different researchers.
The so-called “#BlackFeminist” movement was created and #manipulated by the #CIA from the very beginning. The only difference between Black Revolutionaries and Black Feminist on this issue is that the Black Revolutionaries KNOW they were infiltrated and manipulated—But Black Feminist are still unwilling to admit that they were infiltrated and manipulated, largely because they are highly invested in the hateful brand of #Blackfeminism. 
As a result, the “#HateBlackMen” movement "#timesup #metoo  1850 and 1860 census data so far, showed #whitewomen make up about 40 percents of all #slavowners.
53percents voted for #trump
Undercover #racist liberal

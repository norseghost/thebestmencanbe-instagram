#tbt cause we could always use reminders on how to help a friend who’s been assaulted....There is no real way for someone to understand what a rape survivor is going through unless you have been through it yourself. Even when friends try to help, there is a language barrier of sorts and they can accidentally say or do things that cause more harm than good. I’ve discussed with other survivors how difficult it is to feel understood by folks who haven’t gone through this particular type of trauma. We often feel “crazy” and misunderstood. We just speak a different language now that only people in this “club” can comprehend. But I believe through trauma education and working towards removing the stigma of sexual assault, we can bridge the gap. So here are a few tips. Hope they can help you, too. #thanksforbeingafriend #sexualassaultawarenes #supportsurvivors #empowersurvivors #believesurvivors #traumainformed #sexualassault #rape #abuse #resilience #metoo #metoomanyvoices #victim #survivor #education #resource #support #recovery #courage #mentoo #mentalhealthawareness #healing #sexeducation #traumahealing #ptsdrecovery #ptsd #ptsdawareness #trauma #traumaawareness

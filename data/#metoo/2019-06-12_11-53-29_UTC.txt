#repost @thetword1 #DEMOCRACY ???After more than a thirty years of life in corruption, fear, hunger and discrimination people decided to say enough. And went on the streets for a peaceful protests. To bad the society that we live in, isn't as democratic as we may think. People get raped, killed and thrown in Nile. Why? Because they are tired of being quiet and oppressed. Sudan government also banned, destroyed and controlled on all the media reports and footages. But not anymore. Now that we know about it, it's our duty as a human beings to do whatever we can think of to support those people, and show them that they're not alone. And that they have a right to speak, and fight for their future. #sudan #prayforsudan #metoo #hope #freedom

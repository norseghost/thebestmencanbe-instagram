“LIBERALS have to stand up for LIBERAL principles.” - Bill Maher, agreeing with me on this exact issue. If I can speak for about 4 sentences without being shamed as a racist or Islamophobe, when we as conservatives say that “we don’t care where immigrants come from, but they HAVE to be ready to accept western principles,” this is what we mean. The open-borders European left has perpetuated the lie that all cultures are created equal, that people from outside the west are inherently righteous, and that radical Islam makes up a tiny portion of the global Muslim population (the last one is statistically untrue). The open-borders left in America believes much of the same. But, all of these beliefs are blatantly wrong. The chaos, crime, rape, and murder that the migrant crisis has brought to Europe is a shining example of the need for a merit-based immigration system AND strict border security here in the US, and any true champion of women’s rights, #feminism, #MeToo, or “REAL Muslims” would agree.

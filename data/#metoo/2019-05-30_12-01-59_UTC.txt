Korean troops guard three Vietnamese captives found near a village south of Tuy Hoa in November 1966.

Between 1964 and 1973, some 320,000 South Korean soldiers were deployed to Vietnam to fight alongside the United States. South Korea has never recognised the allegations made against its troops and never investigated. Some of the women that allege they were raped were as young as 12 or 13 at the time. .

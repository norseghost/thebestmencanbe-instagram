So I did something today. But they both have a back story and I would like to share them. Photo #1 is on my wrist and the symbol in between  the two dog paws symbolizes the strength of being a rape victim. Last summer was one of the worst of my life anything that could possibly go wrong did. Two people who I thought I could trust did the unthinkable. I’m not going to go into detail but it has affected my life drastically. I’m still dealing with the emotional and mental pain, on top of that I still have to go to court and see one of their stupid faces. I want to break down and cry but I have to put on my big girl panties and be tough. I have to show that I am not a victim and this is not the end of my story. #metoo the dog paws are for my puppy who has always been able to calm me down just by looking at me and laying his head on me. Photo #2 is on my ribs and it says “I believe in you sweety” it’s something my mom said everyday even when I wasn’t living at home. (Yes I know my mom didn’t spell it right but idc) for months I wouldn’t go to school and I’d just sit down and cry my eyes out until my head was pounding. I needed something to drown out the mental pain so I tried to drink my problems away. No matter how bad I got my mom texted me that all the time. Making sure I got up and would try to face the day ahead. Getting out of that mental state was hard and I am in no way close to being as happy as I was when I was 13 but I am trying hard for my mommy and most importantly for myself. I go to school now. I go to work. I save money, even if it’s just for small things. It makes me feel accomplished and like I deserve to be on this planet. God put me here for a reason and I sure as hell plan to find out what it is.

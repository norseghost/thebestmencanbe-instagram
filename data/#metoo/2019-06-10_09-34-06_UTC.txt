Today, a special court in Pathankot held six out of seven accused guilty in the horrific rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl from the Kathua district in Jammu and Kashmir that shook the country last year. This landmark judgement comes after a year-long struggle for speedy judgements, fair trial and the fight for inclusivity and safety for women and girls in India. Studies show that on an average 106 rape cases are filed by women in India every day. 4 out of 10 such rape cases involve minors. In the year 2016, 43.3% of the total rape victims were minors. Unfortunately, India’s conviction rate is on an all-time low at 25.5%, which means that only 1 out of 4 cases end up in conviction in India. We took to the streets to know what women think about the “rape culture” in India. .

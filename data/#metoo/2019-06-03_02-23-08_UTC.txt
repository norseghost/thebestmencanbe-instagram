Hey Everyone! 
Just wanted to post an update as to the large time gap between my posts. A lot of things are happening now for me lately. 
So after years of failed talk therapy I found something new. I have been undergoing EMDR Therapy. One word. INTENSE. It takes a lot out of you during each session and the 🧠 still works to process the trauma even after the session is over. My 👩‍⚕️ always asks me my dreams and emphasizes the importance of journaling. Its hard but what’s worse for me is continuing to live a life of suffering. To continue life only being able to reach a certain point within a relationship and that’s it. No further? I deserve to experience life with all its beauty. To experience life again before multiple traumas occurred consecutively that essentially crippled my life. I know I deserve more. I know I can get through this. I know I can revive myself again. You can too. You just have to want it more than the fear. The fear to feel different. The unfamiliar. Not all change is scary. Change is hard but nothing is worse than living with regret. If I can do it, so can YOU. Be well my friends on your journey 💫

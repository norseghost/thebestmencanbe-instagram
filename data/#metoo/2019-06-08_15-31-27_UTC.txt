A bully by definition is 
a person who habitually seeks to harm or intimidate those whom they perceive as vulnerable. Students who consistently disrespect teachers are bullies because they know that the authority figure cannot “fight” them back. They know and understand that jobs are on the line and that there will be consequences for the adult should they retaliate.

“Designed by the Israeli Apartheid and paid for by the American people’s money and lives and the lives of the Iraqi people, the war on Iraq endorsed by war monger democrat Hillary Clinton was sold to George Bush Administration by the following people who still walk freely without any prosecutions by the US Department of Justice and its peers in UK and Spain: Bill Kristol, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perl, Tony Blair of UK, Jose Maria Aznar of Spain and their propaganda agent at CNN, Wolf Blitzer. Make your own research to find out more. Bernie Sanders shouldn’t be shy about revealing more of this disastrous war for both the Iraqi and the American People.”R.F.

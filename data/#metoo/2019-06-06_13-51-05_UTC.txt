Less than 50 years ago, any woman applying for a credit card 💳 could be asked a barrage of questions: Was she married? 💍 Did she plan to have children? 👶 Many banks required single, divorced or widowed women to bring a man along with them to cosign for a credit card, and some discounted the wages of women by as much as 50 percent when calculating their credit card limits. 💳💸
That all changed in 1974 when Congress 🏛 passed the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, introduced by Congresswoman Bella Abzug. The bill made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender, race, religion and national origin.
In 1975, the first woman owned bank opened. 🏦💸💳💁🏻‍♀️ Source via @ms_magazine • Art by @liberaljane •

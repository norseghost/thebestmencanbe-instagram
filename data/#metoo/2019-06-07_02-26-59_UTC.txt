This is a baby..a calf...imagine being born in hell just to suffer all because you want to drink her moms milk. Look how terrified this baby is. A cows milk is made for her calf !!! Not for you!!! We are the only species who drink milk from another species. Something is WRONG with this. Don’t you think??? This baby will die afraid and alone. It’s heartbreaking. This is what you fund when you consume dairy. Milk cheese ice cream. Plenty of non dairy options. 💔🐮

Repost from @earthlove777 - Stop 🛑 😞😔💔Rp @estherveganlin You are funding this and paying for it everytime you drink milk and eat dairy products. The next step is death for this calf, killed because people want to drink the milk from his mother.

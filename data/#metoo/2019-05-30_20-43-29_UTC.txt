I am not a leader in my nation. I am the leader. Who challenges me for the presidency of the United atates. I’m a tactical genius, you are not. No one is on my level in the USA, test me at Harvard. I challenge all presidential candidates to an intellectual duel at Harvard, and to run a military training course, and run simulated tactical duels at the pentagon.
I AM THE ONE
Test me like you test NFL players. I’ll pass flying colors. .

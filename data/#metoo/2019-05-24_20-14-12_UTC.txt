A MOMENT FOR OUR SPONSORS...
˙
We are in exciting anticipation about THE ANNUAL CHARITY EVENT AT TOPGOLF on June 2 from 1–4 pm
As much as our staff and volunteers have helped in pulling this together, we could not do it without our generous sponsors. Please help us celebrate them over the course of the next few days.
˙
We start this celebration with our long-term sponsors, AA Van Elslander, Sisters of Mercy, and Universal Fire & Casualty Insurance Company. These sponsors help support our needs over the course of the year. Also, we would like to acknowledge our media sponsor for this event, HOUR Detroit.

This afternoon of fellowship with family & friends will help support human trafficking survivors at Sanctum House.

My first angel graduates Kindergarten tomorrow.
Motherhood is so unexplainable and I feel lucky and proud to live in an era where moms bond over how tired and crazy we are.
In a time when feminism is on the table; the #metoo movement is here and women like #meghanmarkle remind us that despite the tremendous progress happening, there are light years to go in the fight for equality.
It may be her one of many “lasts” but lasts are always followed by starts. 
Sweet girl - the world is your oyster and my heart aches with love for you ❤️

                        "text": "*TRIGGER WARNING*\n(Delhi, India)\n\u201cMy mother eloped with my father when she was very young. But later, she found out that he has several other wives and children from them too. She wasn\u2019t happy with the marriage at all. He didn\u2019t even let her have kids until five years into their marriage! \nWhen I was in my fourth grade, she left him. She found love once again and married a guy who\u2019d been proposing to her for a long time. He was supposed to be a nice guy \u2013 that\u2019s what we thought. We were wrong...\nHe would behave differently with me in front of my mom and when she wouldn\u2019t be there, he would begin all his sexual advances towards me. Initially, I thought that this was how fatherly love was supposed to be. But slowly, I realised that what was happening was not right at all. \nI was in the fifth grade when he tried to rape me while I was asleep. I got up in a flash and ran to the next room and locked the door. I didn\u2019t know how to even begin to tell my mom about what had happened. Eventually, I was put into a boarding school and over time, I forgot about it. \nBut, I would often have nightmares where people would try to rape me or undress me. When I would go back home, I would try telling my mom about this but she would always say that I was lying. I needed someone to listen to me \u2013 I needed an outlet. \nI found my refuge in writing. I wrote down my story and performed it in before an audience \u2013 I even broke down in the middle of it. That video of me went viral \u2013 news channels began to contact me. They wanted to cover the story of a girl who was molested by her stepfather.\nIt was ridiculous! They just wanted the sordid details and didn\u2019t want to do anything about the real issue. News pieces were released without my permission and were circulated widely. That\u2019s how mom got know about everything. She ostracised me for letting the story out and said that I shouldn\u2019t have done it. \nSexuality was introduced to me by my stepfather because he molested me \u2013 that was, and will always remain wrong. This is the truth and everyone in my life will have to learn to deal with it. I\u2019ve let several people steal my childhood from me, I won\u2019t let them do the same with my youth.\u201d"

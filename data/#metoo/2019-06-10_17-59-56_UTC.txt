The most discussed project of the Unlimited- Andrea Bowers, Open Secret, 2018. This activist work documents the development of #MeToo and Time’s Up movements. When you see the names of these sexual predators all together, and some of them are world renowned names, such as Lars von Triers, or Terry Richardson, lots of members of the public were apparently shocked by this wall of shame. I did not feel much, apart from agreeing - i am allergic to violence in any form, especially this one, which makes me literally sick. As one of my beloved female curators put it “the fact that you have a penis does not make you a bastard”...but one question i would like to raise: maybe Andrea Bowers mixes journalism with art...on this argument, the same curator replied “these guys do not deserve their names to be engraved in marble”. And she is right. But I think me too. #timesup #unlimited #whatisart #opensecret #andreabowers

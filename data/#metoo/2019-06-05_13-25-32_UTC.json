                        "text": "Imagine coming from a family who for as long as you can remember, don't see things the way you do. They even say things like 'you're a liar' or 'that's not true' because YOUR TRUTH is something they don't want to accept because your truth hurts. Your honesty makes them look at themselves in ways they don't want to. .\n\n#SecretsMakeUsSick #MeToo #TimesUp .\n\nImagine feeling like you've had to defend yourself YOUR WHOLE LIFE against neglect, betrayals, abuse, gossip, lies, and even malicious attacks because YOUR TRUTH rattles them. Makes them feel angry. Vengeful. Scornful. Embarrassed. .\n\nMany, many years ago, I really, really, really tried to stop defending myself. I read in 'A Course in Miracles' that \"what you defend against you create.\" .\n\nSo, I simply tried to live my best life. I focused on what I could change and who did love me. I gave up trying to convince so many of them of who I am: #Loving. #Kind. #Compassionate. #Smart. #Ambitious. #Driven. #Open-minded. #Honest. #Courageous. #Brave. #Accepting. #Forgiving. #MeToo .\n\nI've learned that sometimes people NEED (or believe they need) to make you be who they want to think you are so that they can stay justified in their anger. Their beliefs. Their neglect. Absence. Indifference. Abuse. Continuing abuse.\n.\n.\nBetter to point the finger, \"Liar, liar, pants on fire.\"\n.\nI've discovered the tremendous #relief of not trying to defend yourself.\u00a0\u00a0Instead,\u00a0\u00a0be your self, my friend. Be your best self. Live your truth. .\n\nBecause those who love you will always love you.\u00a0\u00a0And those who judge you will always judge you. .\n\nBesides, if you keep spending your precious energy trying to convince someone of something they don't want to believe, most often, they'll dig their heels in more. So surrender. Let them go. Literally. The sadness or loneliness WILL pass. And soon you'll discover you have so much room for new, loving, beautiful relationships with #likemindedpeople. .\n\n#JustBeYou #LiveYourTruth #SayNo #BeYourSelf #TimesUp #TogetherWeRise #MeToo #SimplyWoman #WomanEnergy #WomenEmpoweringWomen #EmpoweredWomen"

So Monday June, 3rd 2019 I admitted myself into a rehab for mental health and was discharged June, 6th.. turns out that the reason I was so low was part of the fact I haven't been on meds for 2 years but I did explain that I've been trying to get help for that but I kept getting denied.. so I got back on my meds and now my life is back on track.. I also wanted to say thank you all for the support I was receiving â™¡ .

TW: India
Please read the whole poem,

All Indians are not my brothers and sisters
A country where babies are born out of blue and sex is a taboo
Where men are afraid of the shadows of unborn girls
And kill her before she's born
Obviously, who'll pay for her marriage?
A country where monsters butcher you
And the vultures of culture clean up the rest,
Where abuses are hidden behind the cholis and pallus
Of course, who gives a fuck about them
You can rape a child who doesn't know "S" of sex
And often get away with it
And guess what, if you wanna silence their cries
Kill her and fuck the corpse
And you can still get away with that, mostly
If you're pressed with charges, just tell everyone that
"She asked for it"
I wonder, a 8 year old asked for it?
"Her clothes were revealing, she obviously invited me"
Okay I think kids frocks are considered sexy, I never knew
And you still can't get away with it, here's your trunk card
Make it a religious issue, Ta-da! the problem is solved!
Women want rights? Duh, we want to be alive first,
We are introduced into the concept of sex and pleasure by what?
Did you guess it right?
It's a sexual assault, mostly
And I was no exception
A bus ride when I was 13 made sure if that
I was lost in the realms of dreams and fantasies
Until I was pulled back into the reality by a hand inside my shirt
I stared at it for a few seconds
Trying to decide what was happening
*Sex ed in India is a scam*
 As I opened the curtains just to see
 A 40 year old man fleeing out sight
I pulled back the screen
Confused and filled with goosebumps
As my heart pounded as if it tried to jump out through my mouth
I hugged myself and stared at the sealed screens
I was sure he'll come back and I didn't know why
Soft blue light from the bus streamed into my eyes
As the curtains were pushed aside by the same hands
I collected all my courage and siphoned it through my firm glare
And mouthed two words barely audible, "Go away"
He fled away again as I felt worms creeping in my skin
This is my first sexual experience
Those lust filled eyes still haunt my nightmares
But I slay them most of the time
*Continued in comments*

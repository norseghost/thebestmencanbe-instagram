Exploring my feminine energy, learning crochet in the Panamanian sea breeze.

Have you been seeing terminology like this about being a woman?...
•
"You are a divine goddess."
"You are fierce."
"As a woman, you are powerful."
Usually with a picture that is sensual or even sexual.

In this era of women coming forward, we fight back by making womanhood seem strong, fierce, powerful, sexual, divine, almost pushing ourselves toward "alpha"-female behavior.

To me, this terminology is divisive. By making ourselves "goddesses," does that mean men are not also divine creations? "Powerful" means you can take or assume power over something or someone if you choose. Isn't that a masculine term? What about women who are more mellow and calm, are we not "woman" enough because we aren't "fierce"?

If you are a woman, you don't need to "embrace" any other part of yourself that others say you need to be. You are perfect just as you are. 🙏

Instead of trying to refine our definitions of men and women, let's just be HUMAN.💜 ALL humans have the right to explore BOTH their feminine and masculine sides. 👦👧🏻

My masculine side is competitive, logical, mathematical, and allowed me to reach a point in my old engineering career where I could save enough in order to move abroad and drop that chapter of my life. In Panama, I'm getting to know my feminine side...more gardening, reconnecting with nature, more art, more connection, more patience.

We are all just human. Embrace the human experience, in whatever form it comes to you 💜🙏 How do you explore your masculine and feminine energies? I'd love to hear 😊

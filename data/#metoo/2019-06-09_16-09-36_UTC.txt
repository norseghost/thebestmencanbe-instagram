Read this. Then read it again. I want you to think of areas in your life where you shrink in places you have outgrown. Your relationship, your job, your friendships. Itâ€™s ok to outgrow. It doesnâ€™t make you less genuine or less loyal. Stop shrinking to fit in a box that no longer has your name on it. Evolve...you deserve it ðŸ’œ

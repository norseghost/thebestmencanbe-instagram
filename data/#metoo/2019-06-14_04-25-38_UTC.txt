Your education is a dress rehearsal for a life that is yours to lead. Although, you canâ€™t climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets. Remember that success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm. ðŸ’œâ€¢

I had 8th grade promotion yesterday. It was so fun, and I truly enjoyed giving my speech! Encouraging people to be there best selves is the best thing you can do for anyone. I put a lot of effort and time into my speech / poem, and it was worth it. ðŸ¤© â€¢

Even though most people have started there summers, I still have a bunch of college classes to do this summer. It is definitely difficult. But it is such an amazing experience to take college classes. I am so grateful to have the ability to take college classes and get an education. ðŸ“š

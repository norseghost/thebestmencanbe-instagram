So proud to be part of the feature film “Jukebox Hero,” which tackles the issues of the #metoo movement, mental illness, and addiction with honesty and hope. All we can do is be a better version of who we were yesterday. It was surreal seeing the movie on the big screen because it was filmed in 2013; it took 6 years to make but it was absolutely worth it. Congrats and thank you to the director, Shero, for having me. 💖

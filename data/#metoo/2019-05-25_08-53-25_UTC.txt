Day 5 of @uksaysnomore (wouldnt let me upload yesterday!) wishing you a happy weekendðŸŒž
We would like know how we can increase the awareness of #domesticabuse and #sexualviolence

We would love to hear your ideas!

Campaigning should be a meaningful & enjoyable way to spread the msg!
You can:
ðŸ˜Šshare educational film/documentaries with friends/colleagues
ðŸ˜Šwrite to local MPâ€™s
ðŸ˜Šhave a discussion
ðŸ˜Šask people what they know about abuse/sexual violence

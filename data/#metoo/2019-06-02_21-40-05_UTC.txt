Nothing to be ashamed of, and it's not your fault! Making sure everybody knows this isn't something to be taken lightly. It happens everyday with too many women. 
I made this series of illustrations about inappropriate actions in the streets between men and women. Something has to change, and I believe it begins with our education. It's not women who have to set their boundaries. It's men who have to respect women as a human. We are not objects.

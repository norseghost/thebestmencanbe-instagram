So much is happening right now on planet earth. ESPECIALLY for women.

No matter what is happening, we believe beneath the surface, this is a time of HEALING.
Old wounds and darkness are coming up both collectively and individually in order for us to get real, face the music, and transform what is calling out for a MASSIVE shift. *ahem, cough, women's reproductive rights, climate change, racism, war, political corruption, #metoo, #timesup*

So what can we do when these issues seem so large -- maybe even TOO large for us to actually make a difference?

Let's all get used to using our voices.
This is how revolutions *actually* happen.

It’s in being compassionate to another woman’s beliefs that are FAR different than your own, and speaking your truth with EMPATHY and respect.
It’s in sitting down with your friend and having a hard conversation.
It’s in addressing issues with maturity, respect, and radical candor.
It’s in asking for a raise.
It’s in OWNING YOUR STRENGTHS. (Yes, literally speaking positivity about yourself in public.)
It’s in saying no to a friend, saying YES to sharing your writing and ideas, telling your story, or joining a women’s circle.

For this new moon theme “Free the Voice,” we invite you to unleash your truth!
We’re inviting thousands of women to share an unheard part of their story.

Join the movement by taking this step:
Tell us about an unheard part of your story that you’ve been holding back.

You can either write it out and post it in our private Facebook group with the hashtags #FreeTheVoice #UnleashYourTruth
Or, share with a friend. 
Doing this work individually is one thing -- and to feel our stories rising as women, collectively, is what sparks a feminine revolution.

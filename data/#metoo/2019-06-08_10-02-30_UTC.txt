"All good girls go to hell, 'cos even God herself, has enemies" one of my favourite lines from @billieeilish album. I love listening to new music and if they  have a feminist undertone then even better! Other favourite artists of mine: Chvrches, Christine and The Queens, PVRIS.  Who are your favourite female musicians?

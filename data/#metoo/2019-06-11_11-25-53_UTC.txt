Let’s normalize same-sex/ LGBTQI relationships! ✨👭👬
-
We are not here for entertainment or novel value.
-
The amount of days and nights out where we are asked to kiss to prove we are real, or asked inappropriate questions about our sex life or “so who is the man?”, are more common than not. So who is the man? We’re both women...that’s the point.🤷🏼‍♀️💁🏼‍♀️
-
The recent attack on the women couple on a London bus is something we have feared and many experience. Horrible for these women, and brave of them to talk.
-
So many assaults and harassments are unreported from fear & unfortunate complacency. It’s another #MeToo movement being talked about amongst queer couples who face this daily.
-
An all too familiar situation. We were harassed verbally in the same way twice by two different male strangers last night while trying to have a drink & out with new friends. Happens most times unless we’re at a gay bar.
-
Thankfully never physically, but occasions have occurred where we were in danger just by being us. When asked these ignorant questions or requests to kiss, if we feel safe, we ask back, “would you ask a straight couple that?”, they get all defensive and with a, “of course not, that’s just weird!”, response. Exactly! It’s odd to ask any couple that! Let’s hope its was a teaching moment.
-
Is it because many respect a man in a hetero relationship, but when no man is present, the respect goes out the window? It’s sad, annoying and scary.
-
Our love is valid & real. Our private life is ours to keep that way. We only kiss when we want to & feel safe to do so.
-
And as for the whole “straight pride” argument floating around... You go ahead with that... but first, lets strip away your straight rights to marry the person you love, basic healthcare, child-rearing, adoption, education, safety, religious freedom, military service, employment & basic services. How about when planning a holiday you begin googling what countries won’t kill you for traveling there with your partner?
-
Happy Pride. 🌈

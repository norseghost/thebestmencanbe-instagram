On Saturday @femmeunicorn had an amazing interview with @zainubverjee as part of the upcoming documentary Before #MeToo. The conversation between them painted a beautiful story of what it was like for Zainub to create In Visible Colours in the late 1980s, an international film festival showcasing #WOC and third world women. How Zainub ended up in Canada and being a feminist were key points of this engaging interview.

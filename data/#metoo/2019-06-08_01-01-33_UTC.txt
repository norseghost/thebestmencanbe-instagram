Fuck yes! Women WILD. Women FREE. The #metoo movement which started a few years ago is emerging a new kind of woman warrior 🙅‍♀️ And about bloody time 👏
.
The call of the wild, the yearning from that deep belly place within you, the scream of your psyche for something more, for something real, for something true.
.
That soul hunger is the voice of evolution (nay, REVOLUTION) calling forth a new paradigm, a new way to be, a new way to see, a new way to live and a new chance for us all. It is inviting you to step out and into the unknown. To search your cold and dark and painful places and purge your shit once and for all.
.
It takes a WILD heart to visit with our bleeding, battered and broken places. It takes a kick arse WILD + FREE warrior woman to beat down those doors and sit in the stillness with her own shit 👊
Can you? Will you stand with me with a shaking voice and trembling legs, here at the edge of evolution, allowing for the new to emerge…of you…through you…with you…
.
There is no magic wand 🧚‍♀️ Despite what pop spirituality will tell you, there is no other path. There’s no wishing, hoping, praying, manifesting. There’s just you and your soul and your pain. 
The only way to achieve it is to work for it. Nearly 20 years since I first started down this spiritual path, I'm still working for it everyday, because enlightenment (whatever it is) isn't a result. It's a journey.
.
I’ll stand with you 👊

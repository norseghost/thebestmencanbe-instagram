I know what it is like to have painful sex. I really, really get it. And I know a lot from my experiences and medical training. And I have amazing colleagues who know so much as well.

So if you are struggling with this please come to our workshop this Thursday with myself @drleahgordon and @bewellwithrose

You don’t have to live with this and you don’t have to experience it alone. 
This Thursday May 30th, 6-8 pm @trilogysanctuary

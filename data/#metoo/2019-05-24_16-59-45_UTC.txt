As I’ve grown into my 20’s it’s been brought to my knowledge that I was not my abusers only victim. 
The first time this was brought to me was 6 years ago. I was drunk in a Main Street parking lot crying to a friend because a guy wasn’t attracted to me enough to have sex with me (this wasn’t true, but it’s what my mind had convinced me) I proceeded to cry about why I had to be this way, and why did “I” have to be the only one that was abused? The person that I was crying to looked at me dead in the eye and said “you weren’t” I immediately connected the dots, and to this day my mind races back to an exact event where the individual that had been abused, had been abused. Of course at the time I had no clue because my abuse had not begun yet (or maybe it had but I was so young). Each time my mind takes me there my heart breaks 💔. Now that I’m at a different stage of my healing, someone else is opening up to me... and to think that all those years ago I was picking up a cross that was NEVER mine to carry. To think that at such a young age I was BRAVE and still so NAIVE enough to believe that I was allowing what happened to me, to happen to me because I thought I was protecting those around me. I had a sister, cousins, and even a mother to protect. THAT WAS NEVER MY JOB, NOT MY ASSIGNMENT. I WAS A CHILD, AND I DID NOT HAVE THAT POWER. Now as an adult I hear these stories of children being abused and all I can think is those poor babies they’re so young, but I’ve never stopped to think how young I was. To think of the multitude of children that currently are doing what I did. That are putting such responsibility on themselves, some even blame themselves. If this is/was you, ask God to help you forgive yourself. Let go of that cross that is not yours to bear. No longer allow yourself to be the victim. You are strong, you have survived, your story... #tobecontinued

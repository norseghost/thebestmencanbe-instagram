Be careful if you're new at keto and you're mixing intermittent fasting. You may not need to. If I adhere to Ultra Clean Keto-Raw Fusion I generally don't need to - but right now I gained some midsection fat that's the dangerous type (can affect heart which mine has tested good right now so I don't want to challenge that!) so I'm actually incorporating some very careful intermittent fasting making sure I stay very hydrated and get tons of calories from the good stuff! On the other hand if you're doing straight up Keto - that's really intense on the body to go down to 5 to 10% carb - you have to check with your med professional (ND/Holistic MD etc) to fast on top of that. Dangerous.

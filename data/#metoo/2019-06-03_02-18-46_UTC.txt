Thank you @mina.opferman for sharing your story. You are such a strong woman and I am proud to call you my friend. Iâ€™m sure any north central student can guess who this man is in a heartbeat. Several people have and are dropping his class because of the way he acts around young female students. It is an issue. It is disturbing. It is not your fault. #metoo #standstrong #herstory

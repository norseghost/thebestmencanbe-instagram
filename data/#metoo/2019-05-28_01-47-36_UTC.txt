in light of iggy azalea's nude pictures getting leaked, i wanted to talk about the harassment she received. it's an invasion of privacy to have pictures like that leaked and shared all around and it saddens me that people see it as a joke. she's a human, regardless of her status, she's still human. while the comments are mainly "positive" they're demeaning to her. i hope that one day people will learn to be decent humans and not over sexualize people.

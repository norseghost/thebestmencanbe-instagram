As I embark on my 30th Birthday come July 6, I pray my book release that I put my ALL into(including transparency) will shed light on untold stories that are locked away within ourselves. That story can sometimes eat away at us without our conscious even knowing. More than anything I hope my book inspires this generation to have open dialogue. For a safe space to be created so you can tell your stories no matter how ugly your truth is. You owe it to the inner child within you and the person that God has called you to be. This is a an excerpt from my book, ‚ÄúHoneybees & Wallflowers‚Äù.üôèüèΩüíì

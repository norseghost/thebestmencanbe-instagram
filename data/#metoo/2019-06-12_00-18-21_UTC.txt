So much progress was made in therapy tonight. Massive, massive progress. ⠀
⠀
A lot of the “heart work” I’m currently doing consists of learning how to give myself a little grace and hold space for how my story has played out. To look in the mirror and become aware of all the parts of myself that had starring roles in that story and then to invite them all to sit at the table with me, without judgement or shame. To acknowledge and accept messy situations for what they were and to breathe through any uncomfortable feelings that might still linger there. To learn to no longer accept blame. To love myself through it. ⠀
⠀
It’s been so eye opening and I see so much progress in every session and then in my everyday situations as well. The work I’m currently doing is a part of my life that I’ll never regret, and I’m so thankful for it. ⠀
⠀
If you aren’t currently holding space for yourself, I invite you to. Gift yourself a little grace. Make a promise to hold your own well-being sacred, for that is what it is. 🖤

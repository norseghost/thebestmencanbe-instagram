Hashtag Activism involves individual people posting/reposting/retweeting on social media a specific hashtag which aims to bring awareness to a specific cause. Hashtag Activism or as the critics call it “slacktivism” or “clicktivism” (Anschuetz) is criticized for not doing enough for the cause, and instead makes people believe they are an activist by just posting a hashtag. Others argue that while Hashtag Activism isn’t enough, small voices of each post brings awareness to a cause that might not otherwise be seen and force change from shame.

This is a SNL skit about how Hashtag Activism makes an individual feel they have done enough for the movements like Black Lives Matter (#BlackLivesMatter) from just tweeting. This is a parody to show that more action is needed than just posting, liking, retweeting an activist hashtag. Louis C.K. who plays ‘Scott’ in this video, was a main person accused in a different hashtag, the #MeToo activist movement. The #MeToo movement allows women affected by sexual assault/violence to be heard and have a voice.

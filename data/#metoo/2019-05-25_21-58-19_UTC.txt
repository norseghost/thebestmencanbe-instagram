It was all fun and games 
Till it happened to me 
Pressured and insecure 
He put his hands on my body
Toying with the fabric between us
taunting me 
A blinding grin awakened to my fear 
My skull was slammed into the bed post 
Everything was spinning 
The burning started in my thighs 
It crawled into my lungs 
Blink of an eye 
He left me there 
Small
Cold
Alone 
I was told to join the party
Don’t be a bummer 
Don’t be me
Speak up

So yeah, I had come across the video of Laxmi Aggarwal quite a few times on YouTube but I just couldn’t manage to view it for I knew it’d be really painful. 
Just a few days ago, I made up my mind to finally listen to her story. Obviously her story reduced me to tears, not just because of what had happened to Laxmi Aggarwal, but seeing that positive approach to life was what had overwhelmed me. 
I surfed some more about other acid attack victims and I was so intrigued to see how these women don’t even brood about being victims. They are growing in their lives with all the power and determination and dignity and  being the SHEROES! (She +heroes)
Also, Sheroes is a community led initiative which is helping the acid attack survivors to find a new lease of life. 
Let’s take a moment and be proud of these incredible women!!
And to all the people, please stop being cruel and stop acid attacks.

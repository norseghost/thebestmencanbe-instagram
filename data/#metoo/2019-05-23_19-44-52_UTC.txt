Who else has worried about what others think of them, therefor hiding themselves to escape potential judgement? 🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️⁣
⁣
I did this most of my life, and just now pulling away the masks I’ve hid behind and simply not giving any effs about it. ⁣
⁣
I am a powerful being of light, creator and manifest-er; who also happens to be a bad ass wife, mom, daughter, granddaughter, friend, entrepreneurial business owner, mind-body-soul coach, course creator, meditation enthusiast, journal writing, crystal junkie, young living essential oil pro, taco obsessed, potty mouthed, country girl with an obsession with fancy hotels and room service. ⁣
⁣
I will not apologize for my spiritual journey. ⁣
I will not apologize for sharing my truth. ⁣
I will not apologize to those that don’t understand. ⁣
I will not apologize for saying shit or fuck on occasion. ⁣
I will not apologize for sharing selfies. ⁣
I will not apologize for my growing tattoo collection. ⁣
I will not apologizing for putting myself first so that I have the best version of myself to give to others. ⁣
I will not apologize for being ME.⁣
No more, y’all, no more! ⁣
Who’s with me in living THEIR TRUTH?!?...no one else’s. 🙌🏻⁣

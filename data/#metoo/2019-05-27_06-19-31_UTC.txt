I'm a Whistleblower 
In my soon to be published book, I write about the Queensland education department's corruption and deceit during the reign of criminally charged director general, Julie Grantham. 
I'll explain how senior executive officers operate in a chaotuc department that lacked control under the Qld Labor Party.
The reason Qld is behind in education in comparison to other states is due to lack of leadership, lack of support for principals and teachers and negligence towards their students.

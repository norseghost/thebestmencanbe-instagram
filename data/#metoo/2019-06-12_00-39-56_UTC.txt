Hola 👋🏽 social media has become an outlet for some to show off the highlights of their lives and for others it’s always been this room of darkness as they constantly compare themselves to the GREAT in others. I want to talk about global issues that matter to me - because that’s what’s REAL. Things that I feel my generation should be aware of. #spreadawareness

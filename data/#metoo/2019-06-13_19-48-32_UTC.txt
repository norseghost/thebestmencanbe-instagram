Squats: 3x7 with 425lbs PR and 1x3 beltless pause squat with 415lbs .
Tempo deadlifts: (not shown) 5x3 with 460lbs ...
Squats felt slow today, but I still managed to put 10lbs on my 7 rep pr. Positioning on deadlifts felt off as well today, but it’s nothing I can’t fix 🤷🏻‍♂️ @thedeadliftnutt #hviiibrandgoods #strengthtraining #tendinitis #powerlifting #squat #lowbarsquar #metoo #poop #noquad #fatandstrong

MARY CASSATT
Lifespan: May 22, 1844 â€“ June 14, 1926
Nationality: American
Born in Pennsylvania in the United States, Mary Cassatt traveled to France for her artistic training and remained there for most of her life and career. French artistic world at the time was dominated by Impressionism, an influential movement in which the artists focused on capturing the momentary effect of a scene rather than accurately depicting it. Mary Cassatt became the only American artist to exhibit with the Impressionists in Paris. Her talent was recognized by her contemporaries and she had a long period of collaboration with the famous artist Edgar Degas. Mary Cassatt is best known for portraying the social and private lives of women, with particular emphasis on the intimate bonds between mothers and children. Her contribution as a female artist is notable as she was able to achieve professional success at a time when very few women were regarded as serious artists. Mary Cassatt was the most famous female Impressionist and she is regarded as one of the greatest female artists of all time.

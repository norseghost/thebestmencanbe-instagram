.
the first time i clambered around Hurricane Ridge was in September of 2016.
.
before the election. before #MeToo. before hurricane Maria. before the Great American Eclipse. before Dr. Blasey Fordâ€™s testimony. before Sutherland Springs and Las Vegas and Ascension Parish and Livingston Parish and Thousand Oaks and Santa Fe and Stoneman Douglas. before the UN climate report.
.
it was also before the Thanksgiving when i recalled layers of childhood trauma long dormant in darkened memory-vaults. before the most shattering heartbreak of my life. before my mother was diagnosed with dementia.
.
and, too: before i came out the broom closet. before i fully committed myself to this path. before i found community around tarot and astrology and magick and spirit.
.
being alive is not a cakewalk. this existence on this planet is full of horrors and heartbreaks.
.
but it is also full of joy and love and connection, with harsh beauty and hardened hope. my privileges mean that, at least for now, i can appreciate at least some of my hardships as resilience-builders, trials that have strengthened my structures and softened my heart.
.
i am too small to fix all the wounds of the world. but i am weathered enough to be medicine where and when i can, and for that i am grateful.

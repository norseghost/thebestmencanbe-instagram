NOBODY KNOWS ME (MILLENNIAL OUTTAKE - THIS IS NOT INDICATIVE OF MY NEXT COLLECTION - WHICH WILL BE ANNOUNCED SOON). Written on 17 April 2019 by Nicholas Jones.

I am a boy - I am a girl - I am an apartment complex - I am a slice of bread with the crusts cut off - I was a Jew in a past life - I was a witch in a past life - in the future I will be a king - in the juries eyes I am a ring bearer - I am a pallbearer for a funeral - the death of indifference is upon us and you will have to choose a side - I am the side of life - I am the side of death - I am the epitome of infamy in a world obsessed with fame - I am shame - I am trouble - I am peace - I am the defiance of gravity in a world they can’t understand - I am a cynic - I am a refugee - I am white - I am black - I am ambidextrous because I raise both of my hands to ask questions and it angers people - I am different - I am the same - fuck your opinions and fuck your privileges - I am yellow and black like the bees - you are a purge - you are a whore in the eyes of the messiah - we are God now can’t you see me - I am who I am - I am who I want to be - nobody Knows me. -

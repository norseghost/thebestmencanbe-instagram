I am a women who cherishes my second amendment rights - I am not #metoo...I am #notme and #neveragain.  I do not own a firearm to take life.  I own it to DEFEND life!

Gun Rights are Women's Rights!

I encourage every woman who believes in her fundamental right of self protection to copy and paste and share your photo! (Copied from my awesome friend and Well Armed Woman rep- Rhonda Talton Allen) Thank you so much Rhonda for advocating and speaking out about our gun rights!!!

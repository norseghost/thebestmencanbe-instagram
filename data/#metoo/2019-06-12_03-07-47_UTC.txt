THIS THURSDAY! June 13th I will be celebrating the release of my new music video for "Nobody Wants You" at @icehousempls âœ¨

This song, "Nobody Want You", isn't light subject matter. It is a song about catcalling, sexual harassment, assault, and everyday micro-aggressions that many groups in our society deal with on a daily basis. The chorus of the song portrays the anger behind being made to feel uncomfortable, unsafe, and violated. The verses talk about my own personal experiences in these situations. Sex and gender-based harassment regardless of how we identify is a problem that needs to be talked about even if it makes us uncomfortable.

I am so incredibly proud of this video, shot/directed/edited by the amazing @crj.mpls , and I can't wait to share it with you. Also a huge thank you to my friends @wyleenicole , @leejamiller ,  @johnsquints , @taylorjamesdonskey , and @natemengler . I couldnâ€™t have done this without you and thank you so much for helping me visually portray this song.

Music will start @ 9pm with @laurahugomusic and @annastinemusic . I am SO excited for this incredible lineup. 
Iâ€™m nervous yâ€™all, but Iâ€™m also very, very excited. Itâ€™s gonna be a good show. I hope to see you there âœ¨ ðŸ“· @leejamiller

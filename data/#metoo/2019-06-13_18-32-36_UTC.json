                        "text": "\"I was 15 and back home after completing my secondary school. My aunt sent me to my neighbour's to get the soup we kept in their fridge because ours was faulty. I met her husband who insisted I go get it myself from the kitchen. While in the kitchen, he grabbed me from behind and had his way with me, he then gave me a towel to wipe off saying he knew I wanted it. I returned upstairs to our house without the soup and one look at me, my aunt figured what had happened and charged downstairs while I huddled up in a corner and cried like a little girl. She returned later and boiled water for me, poured it into a big bowl and told me to sit inside. .\nAfter a while, she took me out, laid me down and petted me. She then told me not to mention it to anybody because nobody would talk to me again and I would be scarred for life. I shut up. Three months down, no period. My aunt told my mum I most probably had an infection from the toilet in my just-concluded boarding school. She then offered to take me to the clinic the next day but took me to a pharmacy to get drugs.\n.\nIn the middle of the night, I woke up to the most excruciating pain I've ever experienced to see my aunt watching me. She obviously knew what was coming and had not slept. She took me to the toilet and told me to sit. I was there for about an hour. Clots of blood and other stuff kept gushing out of my vagina. It stopped for a while. Then something slowly crept out, painfully. I was weeping so much. Mum actually came out at some point but aunt told her it was the drugs I took and that because I hadn't had my period for so long, it had piled up in me. She told mum to go back to bed because she had work in a few hours\u2019 time. Then it was all over. .\nSo yes, I was raped at 15, got pregnant at 15 and committed an abortion at 15. It affected my relationship with all males but I have come to learn to let go of my past and move on. I have come to learn that not all men are evil. I have come to learn how to love and be loved because I am a woman and I am strong. I still live with the fear of my ability to ever bear children but it will be well, right?\"- Anonymous\n.\n.\nPlease, drop a supportive comment for her. Thanks"

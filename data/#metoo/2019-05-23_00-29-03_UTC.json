It is still #mentalhealthawarenessmonth, and I can\u2019t encourage you enough to seek out resources for healing and support. .\n.\n.\nWhether you struggle with an active mental illness or injury, or just need help sorting yourself out or navigating a difficult experience, it is worthwhile to find people who share the same experience and/or talk to a professional, who has no stake in your life other than to help *you*. .\n.\n.\nA former version of myself scoffed at support groups, thinking they were for Other People but would Never Be Helpful For Me. I used to think that about a lot of things \u2014 I had an overinflated sense of exceptionalism, and believed that I was unique in my difficulties, struggles, shame, and flaws. I believed my pain was Unique. It was silly, and retrospectively, an obvious defense mechanism against being vulnerable. I\u2019m glad I finally got over it, and started trying *anything* and everything to make myself a better person. I\u2019m still not perfect (damn it!), but better a little bit every day. .\n.\nIf you are waiting for a sign to try a new approach to managing your mental health, this is your sign. Try it. You have nothing to lose, and if it doesn\u2019t work out, you can leave it behind. You don\u2019t have to take everything with you\u2014just what works for *you*. \u270c\ud83c\udffc"

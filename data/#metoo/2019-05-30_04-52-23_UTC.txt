Had the opportunity to interact with Pooja ji Bedi who is giving momentum to #MenToo movement, also as a speaker present was noted Adv Mrunali jee Deshmukh. This forum aims to protect men as well as women in their families, who bear the brunt of #rapist tag, amongst other charges. 
#MenToo is not anti #MeToo, it focuses on protecting the identity of both victim and accused until proven guilty. Let there be a equal and respectful society that will bring law, order and punishment to the guilty, irrespective of gender.

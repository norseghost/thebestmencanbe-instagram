(This one is particularly painful to share, but HR didn’t seem to give a shit, so I need to tell someone this fucking happened.)⠀
- ⠀
My colleague asked me the correct word to use when referring to an LGBT team member’s significant other, whether they should use “partner” or “husband”. ⠀
-⠀
When I told her they had just gotten married, so “husband” is accurate, my male manager snorted in disgust and blurted out, “please, I just had breakfast.”⠀
- ⠀
As the manager of the LGBT individual, I went to HR, who decided to go to the harasser’s manager (an equally “good-old-boys-club” individual), who defended the harasser and said “that doesn’t sound like something he would say.” ⠀
-⠀
No further action was taken. That individual still works there.

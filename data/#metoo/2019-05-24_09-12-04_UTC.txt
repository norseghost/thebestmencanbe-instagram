Blair Berk is asking Amber to listen to a short audio clip and identify the individual's voices in it. Amber does so by confirming the voices belong to Johnny & herself.
The first audio clip has Amber apologizing to Johnny for hitting him in the head with a door. Keep in mind that Amber is under oath at the time of this questioning.
She is then asked if it's true that, on the tape, she tells Johnny she is sorry. To which she answers "Yes".
After attempting to explain away why she hit him after slamming a door into his head, she is asked if she said on the tape that she hit him. She then claims to not know what words she used, even though they were just played back to her. 
On the next page, Johnny is recounting to Amber what happened. He was in the bathroom and she was knocking on the door. After several knocks he opened it. As she was trying to come in, he tried repeatedly to close the door.
After he described bending down and she pushed/kicked the door open into his head. Amber never denies any of these actions, only saying she didn't mean to kick the door into his head.
When questioned by Blair Berk to confirm that she did hit him with the door, Amber only says "I said whatever I said in that recording".
On the next page, Johnny interrupts Amber trying to say she "didn't mean to..." By saying "You didn't mean to hit me in the head with the door...but you did mean to punch me in the jaw" She responded by saying "I meant to hit you..." "I do remember I did mean to hit you."
What comes next is disturbing.
She says "if he was ever hit or touched" he referred to it as "punching or clocked or whatever" or "cold-clock". She added "I mean, he was just very dramatic about everything about it."

On May 30th, Melania Geymonat and her partner Chris were sexually harassed and brutally assaulted on a London bus. In a Facebook post, Melania Geymonat detailed the assault and harassment from at least four men (now identified as teenagers aged 15-18)––they harassed the couple, demanding they kiss for their entertainment and describing sexual positions.

While we move forward as a society in accepting the queer community, we still have a long way to go. Attacks like these are far too common in countries around the world, and the sexualization, fetishization, and violence against queer women in particular stems from both systems of homophobia and misogyny. As both allies to and members of the LGBTQ+ community, our objective and intention is to end this culture of abuse and sexual violence by including everyone in the conversation. While these stories are difficult to share, they are a wake up call to us all that there is work to be done in order to support our fellow queer survivors. We want every person to be in a place where they feel safe from violence, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender, race, ability, or any other factor of their identity. We will continue to share these stories because we understand how important it is for survivors to see themselves represented in order to know that their story is valid.

We are so incredibly proud of all of the survivors who join us as we work toward this goal, whether or not they have publicly decided to come forward about their own stories, and we will continue to stand with all survivors going forward.

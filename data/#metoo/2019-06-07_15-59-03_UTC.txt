I talked carpentry (for a second), intuition, healing from abuse, narcissistic abuse and more in my TEDx Talk called Become the Carpenter of Your Life. It was the hardest talk Iâ€™ve given to date, for many reasons. See the video at https://youtu.be/rzYhY9SwhRU or #linkinbioðŸ‘†(My family filmed this and so glad they did because the professional TEDx Talk is being held up at TED headquarters with no end in sight, so I edited my own video and released it.) #narcissist #stopthecycle #vulnerability #spiritualawakening #childhoodtrauma #childhoodsexualabusesurvivor #sociopathicabuse #woundedattachment #rebuildyourlife #standup #speakout #enoughisenough #metoo

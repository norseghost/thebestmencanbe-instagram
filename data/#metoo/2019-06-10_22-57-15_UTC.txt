You cannot thrive and grow as a person if you remain in toxic soils, therefore the person you became within a toxic relationship does not have to be you. When you leave a toxic relationship you should also be intentional on changing your core. Rebuke the negative traits you accumulated while surviving in an environment that did not have nurturing soils for you to grow in. ­Ъї▒Рађ

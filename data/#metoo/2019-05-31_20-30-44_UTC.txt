My Fifth Round of Chemotherapy was yesterday. It went well. I only have one more and I‚Äôm done with that part of my journey. I‚Äôm so tired all of the time but I‚Äôve been positive still. Trying to be. I recently spent 4 days admitted to Mayo Hospital for a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù UTI. I became neutropenic which is a big deal. This could have killed me if I neglected it. It was very painful but we handled it and my vomiting as well. That was the worst because I had a migraine with it. Then we watched a ton of movies and my pee turned orange from the medication. And here‚Äôs some sad looking pictures to look at, enjoy lol #fuckcancer #almostdonewithchemo üéÄ .

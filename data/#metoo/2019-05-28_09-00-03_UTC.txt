Women of Alabama our heart is with you ❤️💔 A lot of people say you can't be political when you have a business. Except when you take a stand for the planet and say you are vegan of course because that looks good and it's not too disturbing right ? 
At Krowd Konnection we believe its our DUTY to take a stand for women's right. It's actually in our DNA : our mission is to create jobs  for women in need.  So needless to say that the Alabama ban on abortion  does not sit well with us. 
Women of Alabama, we are pretty sure that you know an aunt somewhere in another state that can support and help you for a little vacation but we just wanted to let you know that you have family in Canada as well.  Free and gorgeous country to visit. 🙈🙉🙊 #cantacceptthis

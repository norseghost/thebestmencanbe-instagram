❣️when she transformed into a butterfly, the caterpillars spoke not of her beauty, but of her weirdness. They wanted her to change back into what she always had been. 
But she had wings. - Dean Jackson ❣️ Beautiful friends, grow your wings. Be different, be brave, be uniquely you. 
Let them talk. There will always be someone who doesn’t like what you are doing or who you are, guaranteed. 
But they do not know your story. And if they know it they don’t fully understand because they are not you. 
I know it is so hard to ignore what everyone is saying behind your back (or to your face.) But you also have those who are going to fly with you and cheer you on. 
Keep growing and keep on striving to be the healthiest, strongest version of you. Sometimes that means making really hard choices that others won’t like. But again, they are not you. 
Pray, trust that God will walk with you regardless, and keep growing.

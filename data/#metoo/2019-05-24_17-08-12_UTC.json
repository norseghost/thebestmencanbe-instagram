                        "text": "All week we have talked about summer safety. Today, we want to share a story.....\nShe says, \"I was 14 years old and I was introduced to a 24 year old man by a mutual acquaintance. My parents had no clue he was picking me up from school and we were spending afternoons together. I even invited my friend to meet his friend. He was nice, understanding, and fun. Talking led to touching, and soon there were requests for sex. One day he asked me to go out of town with him. I had the perfect set up to get out of the house and was ready to go when I got cold feet. I began to feel like something bad could happen and no one would know where I was or how to find me.\"\nShe is an adult now and she goes on to say, \"looking back, I could have easily been the victim of sex trafficking and trapped in a life I couldn't get out of. All because I trusted the wrong person who seemed nice and harmless on the surface\".\nWe are sharing this story because we need parents to understand how easily your adolescent can be approached and lured from your home. Especially, in this era of smartphones that connect your young people with people next door and on the other side of the world. As hard as it may be, we have to be even more diligent about knowing who our young people are interacting with and where they are at all times. At the end of the day, predators just need access and opportunity, and often times, your kid is naively trusting the wolf in sheep's clothing. #childsexabuseawareness #stopchildsexabuse #childsexabusesurvivor #parentsofchilldsexabusesurvivor #sexualassault #endchildsexabuse #endrapeculture #childabuse #sextrafficking #atlanta #ATL #Georgia #church #girls #teens #awareness #rapevictim #victim #children #prevention #trafficking  #survivor #tips #blogger #speaker #metoo #advocate #volunteer  #socialmedia"

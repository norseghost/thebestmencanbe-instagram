If youâ€™ve been brutally broken but you still have the courage to be gentle to other living beings, then youâ€™re a badass with a heart of an angel ~ Keanu Reeves 
Somebody sent this to me and I really liked it. People often say to me that they donâ€™t think they could recover after being gang raped at thirteen but itâ€™s very possible to heal and to live a great life too. I do not carry any hate, anger or revenge in my heart anymore towards the men that raped me. If I did, it would have no impact on them and would only hurt me and my family. There is definitely life after rape! Itâ€™s never too late to break your silence and get support âœŠðŸ’›

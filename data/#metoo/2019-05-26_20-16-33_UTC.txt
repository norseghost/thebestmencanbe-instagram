Finding this woman again. Slowly. Right now I’ll just keep reminding myself that I’m in a state of flux. Today is a date I find hard to face each year, 7 years now. Sometimes the choices we have to make to move forward in life can be the most difficult and painful. Becoming whole isn’t always easy and spontaneous. I guess they are correct when they tell you it takes 7 to 10 years to regenerate. I guess I’m on the home stretch to renewal. I hope. Albeit painful at times. Only I will get to have say over this new ‘self’. The festering wounds and displaced roads of the past will just become lessons, as will the good ones. But it’s time for all this change to bring light back in, and renewal. “I am not a Sunday morning inside four walls
with clean blood
and organized drawers.
I am the hurricane setting fire to the forests
at night when no one else is alive
or awake
however you choose to see it
and I live in my own flames
sometimes burning too bright and too wild
to make things last
or handle
myself or anyone else
and so I run.
run run run
far and wide
until my bones ache and lungs split
and it feels good.
Hear that people? It feels good
because I am the slave and ruler of my own body
and I wish to do with it exactly as I please”

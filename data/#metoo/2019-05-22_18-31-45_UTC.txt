HYSTERIA 003 // We can only cast off our bonds if we realize their true nature.

The abortion bans enacted in 8 U.S. states so far this year — and the existing restrictions in many others — have nothing to do with protecting the sanctity of life and everything to do with the threat to social order posed by women in control of their bodies. These bans are about controlling populations who threaten the wealthy white patriarchy — women, people of color, poor people — and preserving an underclass of wage slaves. They’re intended to suppress our economic, political and cultural impact on our country because they fear what they believe about us. They fear that we would treat them the way they have treated us.
.
By forcing women to have babies they either don’t want or can’t care for, we condemn future generations to a cycle of poverty, exposing families to higher rates of homelessness, addiction, abuse, neglect, malnutrition, violent crime and other social ills that researchers and social workers have observed for decades. We smother an economy that increasingly relies on diverse voices coming together to innovate and grow the value of our goods, services and markets.
.
Granting women equal rights under the law and the freedom to make our own reproductive choices inevitably leads to consecrating the definition of what it means to be a person in this country. And our government’s track record on this is dismal.
.
Any law or amendment that recognizes our reproductive rights naturally leads to the need for legal definitions of many other issues that politicians have avoided for decades: our right to equal pay for equal work, our right to healthcare, our right to use our own bodies to provide for ourselves.
.
Enshrining our human rights into law means relinquishing power over us. Defining our value as human beings means including us at every level of society and sharing with us the profits they are reaping off our backs. #hysteriaseries

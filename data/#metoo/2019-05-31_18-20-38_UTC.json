                        "text": "Knowing what they know today, if House #Democrats move forward on the impeachment of President Trump, five things will happen.\n.\nFirst, swing voters will conclude the Democrats are conducting a highly partisan exercise. .\n.\n\nSecond, impeachment talk will largely or completely obscure anything else House Democrats will do legislatively. Voters could decide the Democrats are a do-nothing bunch. .\n.\nThird, impeachment will play a much larger role in the Democratic presidential primary. The issue of impeachment will obscure the other messages of the Democratic presidential hopefuls and raise the prospect of a backlash against candidates like former Vice President #JoeBiden and Sen. #BernieSanders of Vermont, who have yet to embrace impeachment.\n. .\nFourth, the #Republican Senate will quickly dismiss any impeachment resolution passed by the House, killing the issue.\n.\nAnd finally, any of the dozens of vulnerable House Democrats in Republican-leaning districts who back impeachment will have given their GOP opponents a big issue. .\n.\nThe #GOP Senate\u2019s virtually certain decision to kill any impeachment resolution could cause a significant number of discouraged Democrats to stay home on Election Day. Democrats strongly opposed to Trump might feel their party did not fight early, hard or effectively enough to impeach the president.\n.\nHouse Speaker #NancyPelosi, D-Calif., doesn\u2019t want to put her majority at risk by plunging into impeachment. And the two current frontrunners in the Democratic presidential contest \u2013 #Biden and #Sanders \u2013 have refused to join the lesser lights in the primary in demanding Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n.\nThe speaker may not want the great common sense of ordinary Americans brought down upon her party, which could end her speakership and once again put #Republicans in control of the House.\n.\n\ud83d\udd05https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/karl-rove-five-things-that-will-happen-if-house-dems-move-to-impeach-trump\n.\nTHOUGHTS? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\n..........................................\n#foxnews #cnn #democrat #progressives #womenshealth #metoo #liberal #liberals #impeachtrump #crookedtrump #lyingtrump #DontheCon #DirtyDon"

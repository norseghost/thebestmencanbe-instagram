#Her30DaysofGratitude | Day 8
-
"My name is Nten Mpama and I am a student. However, I have been a professional writer and content creator for a few years. I always knew I wanted to be a blogger but I was very scared of starting plus I wasn't sure of what I wanted to blog about. This year though, I made a promise to myself that I was going to push past my comfort zone and start working on achieving the things I'd only dreamed about.

Finally, after months of planning and chasing self-imposed deadlines, i'm launching my blog, @Havilah_Woman. Havilah Woman is a platform for women to share their personal experiences and get enlightened on issues that affect the female gender. Essentially, it's a platform for the celebration, encouragement and enlightenment of women. We'll be launching officially on Friday, 7th June which also happens to be my birthday! I'm grateful for life and courage!" - @nt3n_

Thank you Queen @nt3n_ for being a part of our #30DayGratitudeChallenge and a Happy Belated Birthday!ðŸ’–

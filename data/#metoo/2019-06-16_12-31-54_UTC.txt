To the fella who inboxed me on Twitter saying "if your end game isn't to sleep with any of these countless women who adore you, why do you keep relentlessly defending their rights and freedoms? You're a Man, ACT LIKE ONE"

Mkay, 1. The fact that you even asked that question means you're missing the point of what the #RespectTheLadies mantra has stood for and fought for in the past 20 years
2. you're only 19 years old, I was dodging bullets walking to school in the hood before you even learned how to wipe your own ass, so don't you tell me how to act as a man
3. You don't even follow me, you're just a guy who, based on your profile, is anti #MeToo and got triggered by me calling out society on its bullshit when you came across one of my tweets

So if you think that's gonna shut me up, it isn't

And I'll tell you the same thing I tell everyone who has a problem with how vocal I've been, am, and will be on women's rights, safety and freedoms....

I paint because I want to see what comes out of me next. These three pieces are very unique to my new series. They are set apart because I chose to save the canvas edge, as opposed to stretching it over bars. I love the rawness and vulnerability. 14x18” mixed media and embroidery on canvas, these pieces have been released for sale. Do for inquiries.

It takes courage to take a stand and to fight for others, for yourself, for what is right, and for justice.  Sometimes it’s extremely difficult and because of that I’ve had to build up my defense system and tighten my circle of friends in order to survive and fight. I will not be silenced so others can be comfortable. I will not  back down; not now, not ever!

We love this post from @mowgli_gurl that questions why we find it so hard to use the word ‘rape’ and the negative stigma behind it. Check out the post on her profile and show some support!❤️
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
After sharing her story of sexual assault, @mowgli_gurl decided to create a book including other survivor’s stories that can be portrayed in customizable ways. If you have a story and would like to contribute to the book, please DM @mowgli_gurl or email mowglization.com! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

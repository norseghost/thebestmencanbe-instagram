For all Men... For the whole month of June!

Men are not OK. They're broken and lost in this world of newly defined roles. Feeling powerless, demonised and silenced amid the #MeToo movement. Depression is rampant and suicide rates among our brothers, fathers, sons, husbands and friends are soaring.

Something has to be done.

Dear Men... I see you, keeping yourself small in your relationships, resenting other men instead of loving them as brothers. Losing your identities in society and unclear about your role in your family. There are too many of you unsure of your worth, providing and protecting but not getting anything in return. Too many of you walking around, disconnected from yourselves and the women in your lives, unsure how to speak, share, express, ask for support or be held.

This has to change... so, I am dedicating the month of June to Men.

I am offering all men a session with me for only R600. A 90 minute personal coaching session with me to show you how to feel your fire and find your strength and stand fully in your power as a man of this world. 90 minutes to remember who you are and what you stand for.

Is your month, it's your time. What are you waiting for?

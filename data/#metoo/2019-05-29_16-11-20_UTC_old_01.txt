DIAGNOSIS
.
.

The road to getting a diagnosis for a mental health problem often isn’t easy. It’s a tough path to follow. 
After many many years of struggling with mental illness, I was finally truthful about my past, my present, my struggle with my emotions and my seemingly uncontrollable and random mood swings. It still took over a year from then before I was diagnosed. I’ve been told my diagnosis still isn’t concrete and may change with time. Frustrating but understandable. 
When you do finally get a diagnosis how should you feel? Relief, worry, terror, happiness? 
What did your diagnosis mean to you? I was so RELIEVED but kinda scared ... scared about what this meant for my future and scared about other people’s reactions should they find out. I no longer care what others think of my diagnosis. I am more than that. 
Even when you’ve been diagnosed you then may face weeks, months or years of medication, changes to medication, therapy, different therapists. 
It can be a tough fight! 
BUT! It is so worth the fight. 
YOU are worth the fight! 
YOU are worthy of self care, love, friends, a happy life! 
DO NOT let your diagnosis define YOU! 
You may struggle with Anxiety, Depression, BPD/EUPD, Cyclothymia, Schizophrenia, Bipolar etc etc ... BUT ... .

YOU are not that illness 
YOU are human 
YOU are amazing 
YOU are so much more than your diagnosis! .

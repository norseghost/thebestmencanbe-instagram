Jo Brand has spoken of the need to maintain the momentum of the #MeToo movement despite the fact that some people are “fed up with it already”, recalling a charity event where a man forced his tongue into her mouth.

The comedian told an audience at the Hay festival she was at a corporate charity day at Canary Wharf where “they were all pissed, it was about nine o’clock in the morning”. A man asked for a kiss in exchange for him giving £200 to charity.

Brand recalled: “I went ‘god all right then.’” She offered her cheek. “He stuck his tongue in my mouth … oh my God, it was disgusting. “The thing was, I thought to myself: ‘This is a charity day, jolly, we’re raising loads of money … can I make a really massive fuss?’ To my shame, I didn’t. I just pretended it hadn’t happened and moved on.”

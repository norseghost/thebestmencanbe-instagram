I’ve learned over the years that it’s really important to believe that something is possible for it to happen. Believing we can get that job, get into that program, find our partner, etc. This applies to the healing journey as well. And I want you to know: I believe you CAN heal from your trauma. It may be messy, it might not look how you expect, but I believe you can heal. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This is one of the places I go to heal, reflect, and process life: the Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland. (I highly recommend checking it out if you haven’t before.) ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Where do you go to take a moment for yourself for healing?

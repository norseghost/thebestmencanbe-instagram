They were a failure of perception. A glitch in his ability to process the world. \nEverything meant exactly what he wanted it to mean. \nHe couldn\u2019t perceive anything beyond that. \nThe moment he touched me, I felt two hands pressing down on the top of my head, and my feet sank into the sidewalk just as if it were pudding. I went on sinking, sinking. Gravity was so much stronger than it had been five minutes before. \nI didn\u2019t know it then, but it was my first bout of migraine-associated vertigo. A condition that would slowly take over my life and ultimately cost me two jobs and the career I went to grad school for. \nIn one night, Jonathan had stolen what I had believed was a lifelong friendship. He shattered my ability to trust. And he took from me what remained of my health. \nHe\u2019d done this kind of thing before, and for him, there never had been any consequences. And there never would be. He had reminded yet another woman that he could beat them. He would always beat them. And for him, nothing mattered more than the illusion of his own superiority.\n\n#metoo #abuse #toxicmasculinity #sexist My story at mceaston.com"

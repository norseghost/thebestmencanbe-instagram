Why are we so embarrassed to cry in public? Or to cry at all actually?? When did it become such a problem to show our emotions and be real.

If we cry, we are called weak and girly and unable to hold it together and embarrassing ourselves. ðŸ‘‰Donâ€™t make a scene!
ðŸ‘‰Pull yourself together!

How about... If we cry, we are being real and vulnerable and open and honest and not smothering down our emotions until they explode in our heads.

It is very healthy to acknowledge your feelings, be open to them and to express them. Crying is just one. Smiling, laughing loudly, shouting, screaming for joy, you are allowed to do it all!

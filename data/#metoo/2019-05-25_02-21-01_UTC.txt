You know what they say . . . Start before you're ready 😅
.
I'll be taking over the @_weareher IG account tomorrow morning to make a quick #iglive video about HER Yoga, a virtual #yoga event happening Saturday, June 1st.
9AM for all my Pacific Time Zone homies here on the Westcoast
.
Some of you may know a bit about my experiences with #domesticviolence , and my desire to support other #survivors on their healing journeys .
I hope this event will show survivors that #wecandohardthings and that healing is possible!
.
.
At the very least, you can tune in and watch me struggle on camera (I'm terrified, but gonna do it anyway)
.
.
P.S. The #trailer for the #WeAreHER #podcast is now live! You can go and hear other survivors tell their stories. My episode will be released mid Summer 🙌🏽
.
.
You are loved
You are brave 
Keep going 🖤

Thank you, Stevie, Founder of @_weareher for putting these visuals together, and to @arkive.photo 📸

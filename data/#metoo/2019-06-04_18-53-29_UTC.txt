Big Little Lies 2 
Just when you thought the female cast couldnâ€™t get any better, along come Meryl ðŸ‘Œ

This multi award winning HBO series blew our socks off last year. women in lead roles, older, hugely talented, gripping story line and showing the vulnerability, fight, passion, shame, revenge, misunderstandings and a masterclass in acting! 
Got to love Cold Little Heart by Michael Kiwanuka which soundtracks the opening credits, now one of my all time favourite songs

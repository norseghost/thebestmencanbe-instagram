Madame Nhu. A period painting.
...
Madame Nhu is a highly controversial figure who acted as the First Lady durring the Vietnam War. She fascinates me for her strength despite condemnation from all sides. In her interviews she talks about the struggle of being thrown into her position of power and then being criticized for her prowess. This is a blood painted tribute to her teaching lessons to Southern Vietnamese women on how to shoot a pistol. ðŸ’„Her white face symbolizes forgotten bravery, the tiger is a force which she mimics, and the American Flag bathingsuit saturated in period blood is the dichotomy of America's brand of freedom.

I just want people to know that they can leave a situation that they feel like they can’t get out of. And if you’re made to look like the bad guy, your people will surround and protect you with all their strength. And if you see someone you suspect in this cycle of hell, reach out a hand and a ear for them to listen. Beautiful things can come of it.

She had a dream to envy so she gazed the star,the only thing that enlightened her charm...
She found her happiness sitting by the sea.. watching the mountains and the dark sky filled with stars..where she had this beautiful sensation of floating in the space..
She looked at him and lost her mind but did find her soul..alone she found darkness to be her beloved and a thought striked her,"maybe I was meant to be amongst the stars,so take me far...far off to your paradise".

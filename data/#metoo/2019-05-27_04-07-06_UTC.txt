And he fed me all the lies I wanted to hear, all the broken promises, all the pity stories.  I was so in love with him and wanted to help him heal from all the hurt that was thrown at him.. In reality, he was feeding me all the poison he fed to everyone else.. It was all rehearsed lines of bullshit.. It was all too good to be true.. The whole relationship made me sick and toxic..#becarefuloutthere #thedevilcomesaseverythingyoueverwanted #thedevilcomesinprettypackages

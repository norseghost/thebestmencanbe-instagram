🌴 Dreaming of a world without prisons with our fam over @leadsoulsisters ✊🏾Shoutout to their team for inviting us to be part of their immersive restorative justice training!
.
🦋 We spent the last 3 days in deep, vulnerable dialogue as we collectively learnt how to address conflicts, harm, and violence in our communities without state intervention, punitive measures, and incarceration. We actively challenged notions that removing people from our communities for confinement, isolation, and abuse at the hands of the state is a viable solution to address and transform the conditions of violence our people face on a daily basis.
.
🌞To address violence, we must center the needs of the people harmed and hold those perpetuating violence accountable. Our communities have the agency to surface solutions, to listen to and care for survivors, to hold space for the transformation of those perpetuating harm. The state conditions us to believe otherwise; we came together to ground ourselves in the reality that the state/prison system is the main perpetuator of harm for many of our communities. For our collective freedom and liberty to be actualized, we must build alternative systems of being. Thank you to the Soul Sisters family for embodying that transformation!

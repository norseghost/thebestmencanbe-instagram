#WhenITriedToLeave || Although I had my reasons for staying, there were many times I did try to leave, times when his treatment of me got to be too much. But people who are possessive and controlling are not quick to let their victims go. I was providing him with companionship, a sense of power and a lot more I’m sure, so whenever I attempted to break up with him, he wouldn’t allow it. He would snatch something of mine and hold onto it, like my purse, my keys, or my laptop. And when I would return to retrieve it, he would manipulate me into staying with him. Sometimes with anger. Sometimes with threats. But more often than not he used guilt and charm. Once when I went back for my purse, he tossed it at me and nonchalantly told me that he had taken the money from it. ⁣

And if ever I refused to return for my things, he would text and e-mail me over and over again and ring down my phone. He’d call my phone so incessantly at times that I wouldn’t even have time to make an outgoing call before his next call would come in. Eventually, feeling like I had no way out, I would just give in. He was so manipulative that he once convinced my closest friend at the time to get me to go back to him, even though she was well aware of how he had been treating me.⁣
⁣
What made it more complicated were the feelings involved. Knowing he caused serious hurt, but still feeling attached, still wanting to be loved. This is one of the effects #traumabonding had on me, which I’ll speak more on later. ⁣

One day, when I wouldn’t come back for whatever he’d taken from me or answer any of his calls, he showed up at my home. I was afraid of the scene he would make since there seemed to be no limit to what he would do to get his way, so I went out to meet him at his car. I spoke to him through the passenger window, refusing to get in. But it didn’t matter that I didn’t want to; he opened the door, grabbed me by my clothes and roughly pulled me in.⁣
⁣
I didn’t know how to get away from him.⁣

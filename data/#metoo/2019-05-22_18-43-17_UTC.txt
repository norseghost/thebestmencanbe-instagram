As a man, I support a woman's right to choose what she wants to do with her body. As a man of law, I believe we need to take this a step further and extend this ideology to include prostitution as well. Now, before you quickly reply with emotionally irrational filled commentary, please read logically and carefully. The reason behind my motive would be to help reduce rape and sex trafficking by introducing the legality of structured services offered to the public. The principality of supply and demand would apply here, where if we were to remove the illegal aspect of prostitution, this would help eliminate  the need of its services being run unsafely behind closed doors. Lets face it, it's taking place, whether you want to call it dating, marriage or on a wider aspect with no contractual obligations, prostitution. The taxation from profits would provide revenue to help build schools for the children and also help alleviate our crumbling infrastructure such as our roads, while providing new employment opportunities from a growing market of businesses and buildings. Now, before you shoot this idea down, please understand that your biased opinion will be more than likely based on just your own selfish personal needs and wants, and does not include the scope of the lives around you. Most people make decisions based on their own needs, such as religious indoctrination, and have no consideration or insight into the demands of the general public, kind of like the same assholes who passed this bill in Alabama to begin with. I am currently open for debate on this topic. Please leave your questions or concerns below. Thank you for your time in this matter.

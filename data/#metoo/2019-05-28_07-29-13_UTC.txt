Rape!!! Yes Rape… Lets talk about rape today. This is a very sensitive word. A girl goes through so much still she gets to hear “Why do you wear such clothes, you’re showing yourself as an invitation”. Well if you really care about girls you should be saying this to all boys “RESPECT EVERY GIRL NO MATTER WHAT RACE, NATION, AGE OR CLOTHING SHE WEARS” “Did you hear she got raped??” Well the society is the one who makes things easier for rapists. Instead of gossiping why can’t you go show some love to the victim who got raped. Her eyes were covered which a cloth, her mouth was filled with a cloth, her hands and legs were tied she was helpless. She tried a lot to defend herself. She felt the fear very close which no girl should go through. Her soul was crying from deep inside. The pain a girl goes through while being raped is very deep. If you can’t support her, why are you talking about her. The worst part is even small girls are getting raped. Will you still blame girls?? At the age of four a child gets raped. That small child has not even seen the world and goes through so much of pain. If you really want to change the world you need to understand judging someone’s dressing will not stop rapes. You’ll have to change your mentality to change the world. 
Every girl is strong enough to take her own stand but when her own close ones let her down. It’s the worst feeling ever. Thank you for taking your time out to read this. If you do agree with my thoughts, please do share it and leave a comment.

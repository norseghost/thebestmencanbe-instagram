Shot videos for Washington Post. Thank you so much for the opportunity. Such a powerful and moving story. 
Before there was #MeToo, there were the comfort womenâ€”who came forward despite terrible stigma from their own husbands and children, at a time when the media did not have a vocabulary for sexual violence. The comfort women walked so that survivors today could runâ€”but while the world is beginning to demand justice for these crimes, seventy years later, the comfort women are left behind."

Thanks to everyone who helped out with this story, most especially the lolas and their families who shared their stories, as well as Sharon Cabusao-Silva and Celline Marge Mercado. Celline has an award-winning exhibit and thesis on this topic, which has been featured on different publications, including the Japan Times. For those who are interested, it's called "In the Spaces We Mend." Thank you so much for connecting me Alyx Arumpac!

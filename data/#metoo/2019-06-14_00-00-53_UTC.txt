Everything that happens to us is actually happening for us. I believe that my last journey though darker alleys of life was there to teach me something also. First, I was overwhelmed by the response and shocked to learn how many of you related to my post. I felt a relieve reading though your comments and messages. 🙏🏻 Knowing that I’m not alone took off the layer of anxiety. And all the ideas, suggestions on how to navigate though those times helped me so much. 🙏🏻 You shared some good tools; journeying, meditation work out, diet, supplements or therapy. All to maintain mental well-being. We hear so much on how to take care of our physical health but how about mental health🤔? If you have something that helps you to stay sane please share. Maybe that very thing can help somebody though the challenging times 💞💥 #metoo #allsidesmatter #mentalhealth #depressionhelp

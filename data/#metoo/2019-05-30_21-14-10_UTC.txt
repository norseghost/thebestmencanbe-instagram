In January, we went to a taping of David Letterman’s (@letterman) My Next Guest Needs No Introduction and the guest was #KanyeWest. We were holding our hope for a Kanye redemption moment. It didn’t happen and it’s not going to happen anytime soon because that would involve accountability to be present. Kanye spent the majority of his platform actively advocating against women, the #metoo movement, touted harmful projections regarding mental heath and he continued to justify his positions both through his words and his physically proximity to a moment in which hate rhetoric has a twitter handle. Kanye has not only endorsed a rhetoric of hate & toxic masculinity through ALL of his platforms from the music he’s been creating to the compassionate space and love that’s he provided in the Oval Office. After 90 minutes of Kanye being the Kanye that we’ve have been introduced to and re-introduced to over and over again, WE SPOKE UP. The audience in attendance SPOKE UP. As a community, we spoke truth to the power. The episode comes out tomorrow. Let’s see if @letterman & @netflix  did the right thing or if they’re complicit in silencing survivors. The world is watching.....#metoo #believesurvivors

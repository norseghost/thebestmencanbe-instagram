or those men that ask for your number, you give it to them, then they immediately call it to see if they can catch you out lying. 
iâ€™ve had that done to me before, i was 15 and this guy was going to be my boss. i was a 1 or 2 shifts into a job...and heâ€™d already started being sexually inappropriate with me. not physically, but verbally. my older brother worked in the kitchen with me too, yet the head chef still said these things in front of him. he let me finish my shift early one day, the pub was shut (i worked over to clean it all up after the guests had gone) so he sat down at the bar with me, he asked for my number because we were arranging my work schedule. he also sometimes took me and my brother home from work. also, he was my boss, so i figured it made sense. (he wasnâ€™t too bad at this point, iâ€™d only had a comment here and there, and this was my first job so i didnâ€™t really know what to think). anyway i gave him my number, and he immediately tapped it into his phone, looked at me, smirked and then phoned it. it was actually my number and my phone starting ringing next to me, but i still felt humiliated and kind of scared because what would he have done if it was the wrong one? it was only me and him at the bar, he was my boss, this was my first ever job and i was FIFTEEN YEARS OLD. he was in his THIRTIES. 
iâ€™ll now never work in a pub again, not as a kitchen porter. FUCK THAT. (my older brother is the best guy youâ€™ll ever meet, heâ€™s a feminist and goes to rallies for womenâ€™s rights, he did stick up for me and quit with me after a week of putting it up with...just putting that out there, my brother didnâ€™t just stand and watch and not do anything!)
iâ€™m backkkk, still hella poorly, but backkkk!ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—

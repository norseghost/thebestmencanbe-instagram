I will continue to heal my entire life..\n.\n.\nBut I've been able to move through the various stages to now be able to thrive during my healing journey.\n.\n.\nEach stage has it's own process and looking back I can see how each stage severely impacted my life.\n.\n.\nVictim\u27a1\ufe0fI spiraled. I was in denial for a very long time about the sexual trauma that happened to me. I wanted to pretend it never happened. I couldn't understand why me? I had no self worth & did anything to be accepted by anyone. I became lost in anything that distracted me from the truth.\n.\n.\nSurvivor\u27a1\ufe0fI finally accepted & recognized what happened to me. But I had NO healthy coping skills to deal with it. I had a small amount of confidence, but no self love. I got lost in a vicious cycle of binge eating, binge exercising, & self loathing. Facing the pain was too hard somedays, but with therapy, I tried learning healthier coping mechanisms. .\n.\nThriver\u27a1\ufe0fI finally decided enough was enough. I was tired of hating myself day in and day out. I wanted to be better for my husband, my son, & myself. I was ready to put in the work, to deal with the pain, & implement all the healthy coping mechanisms I had learned. I was done being a victim, I was done being a survivor. I realized MY story could HELP others heal.\n.\n.\nMy pain now had a purpose. And now I have self love. I have respect for myself & my body. I can cope on the impossibly hard healing days. And I can thrive during the process. Even when I stumble. .\n.\nBut the pain no longer controls me. I have taken my life back! No matter where you are on your journey, know there's hope to thrive. But it takes time, and you MUST go through each step in order to get there. .\n.\nWhat step are you on?\n\n#fromvictimtothriver #dontjustsurvive #rapesurvivor #sexualabusesurvivor"

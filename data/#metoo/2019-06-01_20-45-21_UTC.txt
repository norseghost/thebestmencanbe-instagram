Dr Lisa Paul Streitfeld (EGS 2014) “Speculative Realism (Found) Object Intervention” at “Welcome to MIT Playtest” at the List Visual Arts Center on the May 16 opening of MIT Media in Transition +10 “Democracy in Digital Media”. My intervention on the only art movement acknowledged by the institutions in the last decade was intended to bring Graham Harman’s dialectic of “The Third Table” as Eros into the academy and art museum at the same time.  The intervention succeeded in establishing a dialogue with a theater student engaged in a deconstruction of Blanche in “Streetcar Named Desire” for a Fringe Festival.

The slide below on Harman’s dialectic of Eros is from my paper, “Web 3.0 and the (R)evolution of Desire: The Quantum Leap from #MeToo to #WeToo” delivered on a May 18.

The video of my MIT presentation, to be posted on YouTube, will reveal how this dialectic that Harman brought into the art world was interpreted in regards to “#MeToo - #WeToo.” #grahamharman #hieroshiva #art #MIT10 #ListCenter #desire #streetcarnameddesire #foundobject #thirdtable #desire #speculativerealism #eros #MeToo #WeToo

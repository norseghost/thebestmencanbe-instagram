Anxiety affects all personalities and can look very different in various people. 
A highly functioning person can be suffering invisibly too .. Im very open about my struggles and what im diagnosed with but i often hear - (I never would have guessed that about you) or even get questions from others that suffer with anxiety Â« how can you have a glas of wine ? You have anxiety or ? Cause i can never have a glas of wine Â« or Â« how can you take the train ? Are you sure you suffer with anxiety?Â» We are all different ! If i post alot of stuff like taking the train, going grocery shopping, going to gym or facing some fears then i get alot of questions if i have overcome anxiety or Â«now that you feel better ...?Â» like my anxiety is all gone ! But NO , i do have to say that im very good at doing the things im afraid of . If im out doing all these things it doesnt mean i feel great , it often means im shit afraid but doing it anyway ðŸŒ¸

We hope we find you on a break from curling up with your fave #book this Saturday, coffee or tea only a hand stretch away ü§ì

If you're looking for some enriching  #reading this  #weekend, our  #CEO Oona Rokyta (orokyta) recently shared some insight into "Brotopia" by Emily Chang: "Have to be honest. I avoided it for a long time because of the hype and headlines when it came out about a year ago. And there was only so much I could digest around the  #MeToo movement while I was just getting my startup legs under me. But a friend recommended this over the weekend, so I bought it at Chevalier‚Äôs Books and have just started. So far I was struck by the academic studies that supported hiring male, introverted, ‚Äúpeople hating‚Äù types for programming jobs in the 1960s, as they were trying to shift the job to a higher-paying and more complex one. Crazy!" ______________________  #justlance  #travel  #explore  #creative  #inspiration  #nomad  #consult  #photographer  #writer  #traveler  #smallbusiness  #business  #hustle  #startup  #entrepreneur  #saturdayfun  #riseandgrind  #solopreneur  #sidehustle  #travelblogger  #digitalnomad  #workhardplayhard  #worklifebalance  #remotework  #remoteoffice

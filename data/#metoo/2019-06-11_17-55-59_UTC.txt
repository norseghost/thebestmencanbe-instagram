It's often so hard to have any pride or acceptance of myself. I am far too used to being "the failure", "the worthless child", "the weird kid". After so many years of put-downs and so much being slapped with all I have NOT been able to do, I have a hard time dissasociating those things from the good in me.
The fact is: I am a strong, courageous, resilient, and intelligent woman. I have survived pain and despair that would have broken most people. I have made a life for myself out of nothing. I have stood on my own feet, walked through a million hells, and come out the other side. I may be bent and scorched - but I remain unbroken. And I have done it ON MY OWN. I have survived, and I have become an amazing individual - and in this moment, at least, I am proud of the woman I have become. I will own that. 💪

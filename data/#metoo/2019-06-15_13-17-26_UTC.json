                        "text": "A photo of my former husband just showed up in my #memories on @Facebook, the parent company for @Instagram and more than a hundred other companies. I posted it. Then I cropped it, filtered it into black and white, and shared it on Instagram.\n\nMy former husband is a sexual #predator somewhere on the #spectrum between Anthony Wiener and Harvey Weinstein. I left him more than four years ago, in 2015. Yet here he is, staring at me through a #MagnifyingGlass.\n\nHe\u2019s blocked on every social network. I\u2019m no longer connected to his family \u2014 or mine \u2014 and nearly every friend I trusted and treasured. Too many people didn\u2019t believe me or were just too horrified to support me through a situation that became *more* brutal over time, not less. My god, my #grief.\n\nMy former husband is an engineer at @Google. Since learning of his lies, actions, addictions, manipulations, I\u2019ve been stalked or #hacked or doxxed on multiple platforms. For example, in 2018, someone or #somebot was operating a fake Facebook page in my full legal name to sell porn and sex.\n\nThe account had thousands of fans, friends, and connections. How much #money did that page generate for Facebook? For the page\u2019s operators? For the women who were selling their bodies by choice or maybe force? For all I know, the page was showing #trafficking victims or monetizing #revenge porn.\n\nFacebook refused to shut it down for more than two months. Daily I\u2019d report it. Daily my friends would report it. Daily we\u2019d receive assurances that the page wasn\u2019t a violation of community standards.\n\nIf a page that\u2019s been used to abuse someone isn\u2019t a violation, then it\u2019s a #reflection of the values of the company.\n\nOne day, the page just disappeared. Poof. No explanation. Gone.\n\nI don\u2019t want to live this horror. It haunts my dreams, breaks my #spirit, terrorizes every connection I seek to form. No matter what I\u2019ve done to move on, no matter the time I\u2019ve spent in court, under police protection in a safe house, or hiding it in plain sight, it follows me across websites.\n\nThis situation has defined my digital identity. In fact, it was my digital identity long before I learned of his actions...."

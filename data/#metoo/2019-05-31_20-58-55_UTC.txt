If you’ve been following my stories, you’re well aware that I’ve been trolled by some ass**** telling me to “get raped.” He posted screenshots of my pictures to his account and made fun of me for being an anti-rape activist, claiming that most rape allegations are false. He’s made multiple accounts and is continuing to do so. We did some digging and it looks like this person is a high schooler. I’m not surprised but I am disgusted. How is it that CHILDREN can hold these violent beliefs and spew this hate? Because they have been taught by someone - their parents, teachers, coaches, peers - that it’s OK. They have learned, internalized, and externalized the idea that it’s OK to tell someone to “get raped.” THIS IS RAPE CULTURE. Thank you to everyone who reported him. Our community is so much stronger than his violence.

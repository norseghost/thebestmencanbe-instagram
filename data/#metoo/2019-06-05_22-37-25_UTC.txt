“We are not meant to nor are we equipped to nor are we obliged to heal all the wounded souls that come our way, especially if doing so means wounding ourselves…But once you begin to make the difficult decisions necessary to reclaim your life, you will move closer to what is aligned with who you truly are and what you truly deserve. It’s like sending out a message energetically that says, “No, I no longer choose this. I deserve better.” The universe will respond accordingly. The process may be super challenging, but on the day you find yourself far removed from toxicity, manipulation and abuse, and surrounded by more joy, love, comfort, safety and peace than you could have ever dreamt possible, you will have no question as to whether or not the work has been worth it. There is beauty beyond your imagination awaiting you on the path of freedom.” #ourwomensvoices

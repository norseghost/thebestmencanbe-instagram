â€œI have never spoken publicly about my abortion. In some ways, I have felt I should not have to, because it is an intensely personal decision. But I have decided to speak about it now because I am deeply concerned about the intensified efforts to strip choice & constitutional rights away from pregnant people & the simplistic ways of trying to criminalize abortion." - @repjayapal

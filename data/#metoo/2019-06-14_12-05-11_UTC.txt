On Tuesday, we came together to unveil the â€˜Mother and Childâ€™ sculpture, designed by Rebecca Hawkins. The sculpture will serve as a beacon of hope to all victims of sexual violence around the world.

We were joined by Baroness Emma Nicholson, who shared with us how she had been unaware of the trauma and suffering of the Lai Dai Han until recently; ðŸ—£ "We are 20-30 years along and the sufferings are still there with these people" ðŸ”Ž You can watch her full speech on our website - Link in bio!

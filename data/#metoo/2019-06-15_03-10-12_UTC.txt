Diamond E Testing shorted my last paycheck by $1500. Tyler demanded that I write him a check for the ODOT CDT course he told me to take before handing over my pay and accused me of making an unauthorized order for radiation dosimetry badges, which are required by the State, and he was failing to supply to his staff so the VP told me to order them. I had documentation proving that I was asked to order them.  Um, so this is all illegal behavior. My son was ready to beat the shit out of this guy because he's the one who sees me crying at home. But I'm a resourceful bitch. 
I had Matt come with me to pick up my check, which was written only after I threatened to file a claim with BOLI. Matt protected me from my sociopath exhusband 15 years ago, when nobody else did. He dressed in his scariest black death metal and punk vest, full sleeve tats, sunglasses and a glare. He's huge and terrifying, actually. Once again, he played the part of my bouncer today. They behaved. I love him forever for being that guy for me. 
But like I said, my check was short by quite a lot. 
So I hired a lawyer today.

Actually quite a few good reasons.\nBut today, I'll talk about one of them.\n*\nMy family decided to visit DC for the Memorial Day weekend. So we did. We stayed with friends.\nThe first morning there I woke up at 6 am. It was a gorgeous morning, so I decided to take my morning walk around the neighborhood.\nMy husband is a light sleeper and I didn't unpack the night before, when we arrived, so I just slipped my dress I wore the day before, took my cellphone,\nput my headphones on and walked out the door listening to @oprah \u2019s inspiring @supersoul podcast.\nOur friends don't live in the perfect neighborhood, but it's still decent.\nLong story short. I was admiring flowers in small gardens in front of the row houses in this neighborhood, \nI saw a woman working in her vegetable garden. I crossed paths with a couple gentlemen and passed by a fenced park with what seemed\nto be a community garden in the middle of it :-D\nIt was a sunny, warm and quiet morning filling with a sense of fresh from the morning dew. Just what I needed before the noise of the day woke up and took over our lives.\nAnd then something unthinkable happened.\nAs I was walking and enjoying Oprah's wisdom I heard a sound. It was getting louder and louder, but by the time I noticed it was getting closer to me and turned\nit was already too late.\nThere was this man who raised his hand and slapped me on my bottom and ran away scared as fast as he could.\n*\nTo make matter worst, I just had passed a half of block away a police car on duty.\nAnd when I ran after the offender, stopped by the police car to report what happened, the guy who was on duty responded in the most apathetic, uninterested and unalarmed way to the occurrence.\nHe was also young, just like my offender.\n****\nContinue reading in comments...\n.\n.\n.\n#womensrights #metoo #health #selflove #women #womensrights #notyourbodynotyourchoice #notyourbody #womenmarch #justiceforwomen #justice"

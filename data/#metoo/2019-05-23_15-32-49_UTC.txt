So yesterday I was traveling to Boisar. A place near Virar, Mumbai. I was going to my grandmother's place.

I witnessed a thing which I would like to share.

I was travelling in a rickshaw from railway station to the destination where I wanted to reach,

I was sitting in the front with 3 other guys including the driver,
Back part of the rickshaw was forcefully filled with 4 people, while the actual maximum capacity was of 3 people.

There were 2 teen girls on the left side, followed by one lady of almost 30-35 years of age, and then there was an old man aged between 55-60.

I am making myself clear here itself that I am not supporting or opposing any person or gender here, just read it till the end.

Eventually like every other place in our country the roads were not in a good condition obviously,

Because of which we were getting many jerks on the roads, eventually during one such big pot hole, the old man MAY have accidentally touched the lady which happened involuntarily ( I guessed so, I maybe wrong too) and if I guessed it wrong then he got what he deserved but also look at the other point of view.

So the lady immediately started shouting "How dare you touch me, you bloody cheap pervert" 
To which the man immediately apologized and said it was because of the pothole and not intentional.

She told the driver to stop and started yelling at the man that she knows what he was upto, every men is the same.

She told the man to come out to which the man refused and was also apologizing continuously that it wasn't intentional it was by mistake.

And suddenly 3-4 men appeared all of a sudden, they didn't arrive they just appeared all of a sudden which happens every time when there is a fight in our country because there are large number of unemployed people in our country and this is the only entertainment source they have.

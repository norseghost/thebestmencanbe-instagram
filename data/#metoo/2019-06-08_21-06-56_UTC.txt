I find myself about 80 percent of every day thinking about the shit I hate about myself and how much I wish I was different. I am on day 183 of benzo withdrawal from the doctors having me on Valium for over 10 years and now that I am awake and feeling my feelings again, rather than being a tranquilized zombie vegetable 🧟‍♀️ 🥕, I am being hit with so many thoughts and emotions. ....“My stomach is big”...”I’m ugly” ..”What if I had never taken Benzos”.. “would I look like this?” ..“Would I have children?”...”would someone love me?”...“I’m fat”.. “I hate my arms”.. “I shouldn’t eat that” ..”I’m ruined”. ALL OF THAT IS FUCKING BULLSHIT. After so many years of self deprecation it truly begins to add up and tear one down. The self loathing for me comes from a childhood laden with abuse and trauma.  All of the ”what ifs” are not relevant at this point. What good does it do to put ourselves down? What good does it do to ask incessant “what ifs?”. NOTHING. It does nothing but keep us in a stagnant, self loathing place. I am practicing self love today by naming something that I love about myself. *Out loud. 👉🏼 I love my sense of humor and I love my naturally golden hair. There. I did it. 2 full things right there that I love about myself. For today, what is One ☝️ thing that you love about yourself? .

A list of things that hurt (in no particular order)

1. I am half poetry and half tragedy, it’s impossible to put what happened to me into words, nonetheless I still try.
2. There’s no magic number of days it will take to feel at home in this body again.
3. He is loved by everyone, many will accuse me of lying and I’m not sure what I’m going to do. 
4. I haven’t been sober since it happened, there is so much lost time.
5. The 27th of January 2018.

Maggie Tracey was the Chair of the #campaign for #prochoice that #codefied Nevada's Roe Vs Wade law in 1991, and is now state chair of the Women's Political Caucus. I am so proud that she is now repping the Pretty Ugly #genderpaygap Pig and even prouder to call her my aunt. I love my family. We must never stop fighting the good fight. The link for the Pretty Ugly website is in my bio, where you can read full inspirations for each ring on the product pages, and the full ethos on my "about us" page.
Let's do this.

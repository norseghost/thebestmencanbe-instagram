On this Transparency Thursday, our daughter shares her story, where she is now, and why she supports this labor of love know as Comfortinthestorm. 
As parents the parents of a survivor, we know all too well the guilt and shame you experience when you feel that you failed to protect your child.  But we are here to tell you that while the journey to healing isnâ€™t easy, it is possible. 
Our family has found purpose in our pain and we simply want to help provide comfort in the storm for families who are dealing with the trauma of child sex abuse as well as shield as many other families as we can from it.

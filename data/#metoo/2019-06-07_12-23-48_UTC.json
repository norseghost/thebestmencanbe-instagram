But more importantly, why do we think we need anyone to apologize or explain things to us?*\n*\nWhy aren\u2019t we looking inside ourselves and reconciling that we made the choices we made because that was what we wanted at the time (and if we don\u2019t agree with those choices, we move on knowing we will make better choices), understand that things went down the way they did because everything happens exactly when it is supposed to happen, and meditate through it all, cutting cords, and embracing love. *\n*\nInstead we let our ego lead us, listening to our ego tell us that this breakup somehow confirms every awful thing we have ever felt about ourselves to be true. It\u2019s not. All it means is that she/he was meant to be in your life for the time they were in your life, in the way they showed up. Period. Now it\u2019s time to get on with living and having experiences and reflecting so that you grow and spiritually evolve. *\n*\nWe only need closure when we show up with our ego first because your ego will always find a way to show you you\u2019re right about every false belief you have about yourself. *\n*\nSelf love and a deep awareness of self worth helps this. Connection to your spiritual side helps this. Meditation helps. Working out helps. Affirmations help. *\n*\nGetting into another relationship to prove to yourself and the world around you that you\u2019re loveable doesn\u2019t help. Sitting in front of someone who treated you like garbage while they tell you the laundry list of what\u2019s wrong with you doesn\u2019t help. *\n*\nLINK IN BIO for a free resource to picking up the pieces after divorce!"

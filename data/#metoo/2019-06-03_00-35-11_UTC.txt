Wonderful links to female positive porn. (I am unaware of any concerns regarding Erika Lust) Repost: Please re-share this post with your followers, as it is an updated list based on feedback from activists I trust.

I’m learning that one of the most valuable/vulnerable parts of public activism is that it opens us up to accountability around the resources we share.  Thank you to those who reached out to let me know about Erika Lust’s problematic behavior and lack of accountability about this behavior.  Thank you to @justice4sexualassault for sharing your first hand experience with assault and to @whatsmybodydoing for making me aware of Rooster’s experiences.

Link to Rooster’s video about Erika in bio.

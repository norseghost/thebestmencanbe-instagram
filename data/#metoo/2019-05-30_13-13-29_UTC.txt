I donated school supplies to the school Mya went to back in the day. I lived in the Bronx for 4 years. I am so angry I can’t see straight. The patriarchy & misogyny kills. Rape culture kills. This little girl deserved so much better. .

Text: The administration at Mya Vizcarrondo-Rios’ school completely failed her & betrayed her. Her parents were not informed as they should have been. I am sorry Mya, that you did not get the justice you deserved. I know how she must have felt. TW: abuse

.I was raped in high school by a boy who was supposed to be my friend. As someone already traumatized by ongoing sexual abuse by that age, it didn’t even occur to me to seek justice. Mya tried to get help. I am so angry & heartbroken for this child & her family. Her abusers’ parents failed her and her abusers too. What boy thinks it’s ok to force a girl to perform oral sex at school after relentlessly bullying her? A child not brought up right at home. #metoo #fuckthepatriarchy #blacklivesmatter #afrolatina #afrolatino #rapeculture

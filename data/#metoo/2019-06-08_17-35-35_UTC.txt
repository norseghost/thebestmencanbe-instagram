Solidarity is our Weapon! ✊

This morning I woke up and had this image in my head! It just didn’t let me go. Yesterday a lesbian couple was attacked in London! They were attacked and provoked by four young men to kiss. When they refused they got beaten over and over again! They were sexualisied and punished for the crime of not bending to the needs of a group of men!⠀
⠀
One of the womxn looked right into the camera after the attack, full of blood with her head held high. Fearful but with fight in her eyes! It just woke something up in me again! ⠀
⠀
We are still afraid for a reason!⠀
⠀
As womxn! ⠀
As queer womxn!⠀
As lesbian!⠀
As gay!⠀
As trans!⠀
As different!⠀
⠀
That is why we have to go on the street as womxn and as lgbtq*. That’s why we still need to stand up and fight for us! As long as we can’t be save in this world because parents are still teaching there kids that we are less valuable then straight white men. We need to hold our heads high and fight! But that’s doesn’t mean we are not afraid every time we walk the streets at night and have a group of men calling after us, or somebody screaming after us because we are holding hands or shared a kiss.⠀
⠀
We are afraid! We are NOT afraid!⠀
⠀
We will not bend! We stay together and be brave together! ⠀
Go to your local pride and show your support! ⠀

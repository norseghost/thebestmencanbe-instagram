Gearing up for the weekend! Friday nights were when the ladies on the Houston Herricanes climbed onto a bus to make it to their Saturday games in Oklahoma. Thank you to our contributors from yesterday @carra.oneal @jenboseph! We've had an amazing week and are eternally grateful for everyone's support.

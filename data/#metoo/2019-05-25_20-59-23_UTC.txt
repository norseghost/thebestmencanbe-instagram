I used to wonder why me when something difficult or heartbreaking happened in my life. While I know everyone has their own struggles, it’s hard not to feel like the universe is just picking on you sometimes. The thing is, every misfortune or misstep in my life has taught me a lesson, expanded my world views, and made my heart stronger and more eager to share love. 
I’m strong because I’ve been weak. I’m fearless because I’ve been afraid. Im wise because I’ve been foolish. 🤷🏽‍♀️ difficult roads exist, but here you are living despite it all

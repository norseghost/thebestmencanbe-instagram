Hooray! My interview with @uknowkatobrien screenwriter/teacher ( @ramisfilmschool @columbiachi @depaulu ) is now up on cinemafemme.com !!!.... @cinemafemmemagazine “Something I was recently exploring, in my reflection of my creative work that I had to do for teaching, was that ten years ago the perception of feminist storytelling was like women acting like men, still ... even if you go back to 'I Love Lucy,' much of the comedy that the show gets is when Lucy and Ethel puts on the pants, or put on a hat, you know? 
So from 'I Love Lucy' to the 2000s, we were in this era. I mean you can look at Goldie Hawn’s movies in the '70s and '80s, it was women acting like men. Can they be raunchy? Can they be dirty? Sexually and physically. Can they be tough? Can we take, you know, 'Legally Blonde,' she’s too pink, she’s not serious enough for Harvard Law. The success in these movies were very much rooted in women acting like men. 
And now I think we're at a place where we can push beyond that and innovate." #KatherineOBrien #WomenInFilm #Screenwriter #Trailblazer #FemaleFilmmaker #Comedy #WomenInComedy #ChicagoFilmmaking #Hollywood #MeToo

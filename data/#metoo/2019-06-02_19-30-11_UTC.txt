ALADDIN Redux Thoughts:

The movie was FANTASTIC!

The soundtrack.  Totally awesome.  Downloaded it when I got to my vehicle.

New flourishes and nods to the cartoon were abundant.

Will Smith was phenomenal.

I’m Googling things I didn’t remember from the cartoon.

Go see it now.  With your adult friends first then take the little ones to see it.  No littles in your life?  Give a gift card to a deserving parent and his/her/their kiddos.

Props to Disney for dressing Jasmine modestly.  #metoo Her brains and inner beauty are so much more than a bare torso. 
I’m super excited that the live musical is coming to DSM this month!

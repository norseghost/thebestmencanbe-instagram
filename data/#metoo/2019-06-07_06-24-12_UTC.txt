"Every morning is a blank canvas, and your day will be whatever you choose to make it" ðŸŒŠðŸŒŠ If your having a bad day, just remember tomorrow is a new day. In times of difficulty or "down days" we know it is not for ever. Look forward to the future. 
Currently my bad days are much greater than my good days, however I have planned things to look forward to. To live for and and to do. For me at the moment it can simply be going for a coffee with a friend, or a movie night with my one and only ðŸ‘«. We live our lives looking through other people's eyes, getting jealous because they are off seeing the world, and we are stuck here with depression, anxiety or any mental health disorder that is stopping us doing that. But it doesn't matter, your life is your canvas and do what you can to make you happy ðŸ§¡ðŸ§¡ #WordsHavePower #happiness #downdays #depression #anxiety #mentalhealth #recovery #rapesurvivor #metoo #surviving #living #gettingby #ptsd #bpd #smallsteps #happy #love #goodpeople #family #friends #you #selfish #selflove #selfcare #beyou #liveyou

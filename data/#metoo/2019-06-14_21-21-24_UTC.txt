Ashawnty Davis, a daughter, a student, a friend, a cousin, a niece and a story that ended too soon. Ashawnty was 10 years young when she attempted suicide by hanging in a closet at home. She was committed to a childrenâ€™s hospital in which she was taken off life support two weeks after being found in that closet. After further investigation, family states that the reason for the attempt was due to bullying at school. Ashawnty had communicated with her school about ongoing bullying, but the school failed her by not intervening. Her parents conveyed that Ashawnty was bullied after a video of a fight she had at her school that was later posted on an app. Ashawnty confronted the girl who had already been bullying her, stated by her mother, and the fight was recorded on a cell phone and posted to the app, Musical.ly.

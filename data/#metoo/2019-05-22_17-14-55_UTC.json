                        "text": "But Wylie wasn\u2019t just talking about fashion. He had recently been exposed to a new discipline: \u201cinformation operations\u201d, which ranks alongside land, sea, air and space in the US military\u2019s doctrine of the \u201cfive-dimensional battle space\u201d. His brief ranged across the SCL Group \u2013 the British government has paid SCL to conduct counter-extremism operations in the Middle East, and the US Department of Defense has contracted it to work in Afghanistan.\n\nI tell him that another former employee described the firm as \u201cMI6 for hire\u201d, and I\u2019d never quite understood it.\n.\n- It\u2019s like dirty MI6 because you\u2019re not constrained. There\u2019s no having to go to a judge to apply for permission. It\u2019s normal for a \u2018market research company\u2019 to amass data on domestic populations. And if you\u2019re working in some country and there\u2019s an auxiliary benefit to a current client with aligned interests, well that\u2019s just a bonus.\n.\nWhen I ask how Bannon even found SCL, Wylie tells me what sounds like a tall tale, though it\u2019s one he can back up with an email about how Mark Block, a veteran Republican strategist, happened to sit next to a cyberwarfare expert for the US air force on a plane. - And the cyberwarfare guy is like, \u2018Oh, you should meet SCL. They do cyberwarfare for elections.\u2019\n.\nIt was Bannon who took this idea to the Mercers: Robert Mercer \u2013 the co-CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who used his billions to pursue a rightwing agenda, donating to Republican causes and supporting Republican candidates \u2013 and his daughter Rebekah.\n\nCarole Cadwalladr\nThe Guardian\n\n#marketing #trending #profit #political #success #collective #ootd #politics #trending #metoo #timesup #trend #strategy #feminism #finnishgirl #freedom #graphics #future #lifestyle #journalist #journalism #psychology #god #fashion #trendy #hygge #blogger #influencer #business #lgbt #concept"

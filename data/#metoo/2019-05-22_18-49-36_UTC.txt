Men have no idea what it takes to be a woman. To grin and bear it and persevere. The constant state of war, navigating the relentless obstacle course of testosterone and misogyny, where they think we are property to be owned and plowed. But we’re not. We are people, just like them. Equals, in fact, or at least that’s the core of what feminism is still trying to achieve. The job is not over. We’ve made great progress. There are female CEOs, though not very many. There are females writing for the New York Times and winning Pulitzer prizes, though not very many.  There are female politicians, though not very many. But these advances are only on paper. The job won’t be over until equality permeates the air we breathe, the streets we walk and the homes we live in. #maleallies #feminism #feminist #whyineedfeminism #malefeminist #EveryWomanIKnow #rapeculture #womensupportingwomen #believewomen #timesup #victimblaming #metoo #StrongWomen #girlpower #womenempowerment #empowerment #womensreality #WhyIDidntReport #believesurvivors #endabuse #NoMeansNo #prochoice #consent #scarytimeforwomen #mylife #equality #maleprivilege #metoo

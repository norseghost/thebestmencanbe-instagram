My first rape story (this may be triggering to some readers. Read only if you feel you can)
Throughout my childhood I was raped every day of my life that I was home by a family member. I remember the first time it happened. In fact, my first childhood memory is of my pants being zipped up while I was waking up and those family members running away when they saw I was waking up. This happened at age 4. This continued for six years and worsened. I was locked into the family members room daily and told it was a game that I was not allowed to tell my parents about. When I was 10 I realized it wasn't a game and I went into understanding of what they were doing. I immediately told my mom. She got pissed but oh no, not at my rapist, at me. She took me to doctors, to gynaecologist, to defacts and even with all of them saying it did happen and I had trauma, she called me a bullshit liar and dismissed it. She never spoke of it till I was 16 years old when the truth came out about it. It turns out she never even told my dad about any of it. Though I will never ever forgive my rapist, I do forgive my mom. She knows the truth now and I know she feels guilty about the incident I saw it in her eyes when i was in the hospital for my second time being raped but that's a story for another post.

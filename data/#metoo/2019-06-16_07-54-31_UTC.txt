"It's not his fault she should have been careful," "He is a boy what do you expect" "Oh come on, not all men are like that."
This and that

This and that,

This vicious cycle of blaming it on the "other" sex and defending the other by saying it's in their nature is the reason that feeds the Male Ego.
"Oh god ! Why are you crying?
 Men don't cry." "Don't be a pussy. Man up." "How dare she reject you. She is a whore."
This and that

This and that.

This forcible suppression of expressing ones genuine emotions that results in the formation of poison which disrupts in uglier ways leading to toxic masculinity. 
Just STOP.

Stop doing this
Which results in that.
Stop the vicious cycle of "this and that". Drain the poison 
Let the emotions rain
Put a stop to this blame game
And for every body's sake
Let humanity reign. //

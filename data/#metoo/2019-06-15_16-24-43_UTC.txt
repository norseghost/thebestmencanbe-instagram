One of the great parts of being involved in @tedx_glasgow was chatting to so many wonderful people! The theme was Connection and they encouraged everyone to engage and speak to one another. So many people came up to me to chat, often sharing similar stories and telling me how my story resonated with them. And I will never get bored of signing my book!

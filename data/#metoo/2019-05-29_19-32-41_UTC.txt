Huge congratulations to @aderonstar and the @awanifilm team on winning the UNESCO Prize at the Afrika Film Festival.

Awani is a documentary that serves as a timeline that examines the evolution of the role of Nigerian women, starting from pre-colonial Nigeria to the present day. The documentary uses a blend of archival footage and expert commentary to make the case that the role women play is not due to any one individual or specific time period but a mixture of economic incidences and colonialism that shape political and social attitudes towards women. Awani is a thought provoking documentary that aims to simply answer the question, how did we get here? Our founder, Dr Kemi DaSilva Ibru was featured in the documentary and shared answers to this important question.

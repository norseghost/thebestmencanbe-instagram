Last night I cracked open. Old thought patterns came up and tore through me like a knife to my wrist. A dream triggered a sexually traumatic attack. Yall sexual trauma is a hard one to release and process... even years later, the energy yday was just right to help concoct the perfect painful potion to break me open all over again. This emotional pain has manifested into physical illness. My stomach, womb, neck are completely wrecked right now, I've been physically sick all last night and today. Trauma can linger in our wombs and hide within us, and while it can be processed and released it's okay to have to go through it as many times as it takes to full pull that negative energy from your body. To all the ladies, and men bc they are #metoo, who have experienced sexual harassment and/or sexual abuse, I am thinking of you now. I know I was feeling completely unworthy, uncomfortable, invisible and completely alone. If you are feeling this way, darling, you can always reach out to me, I'm not a professional in the matter, so maybe a professional is better 😂 but just remember, you are not alone.

You are NOT alone; even if in the moment it feels that way with an intensity to burn 1,000 suns. PTSD from these violations of your boundaries is valid. You are worthy of goodness. My mind was playing absolute tricks on me, to the point of wanting to give up, but dont fall victim to the brain. Deep breaths, speak your truth, and move forward. Hoping to heal myself even more deeply through the rest of the year. You are loved, you are valued, and you are seen.

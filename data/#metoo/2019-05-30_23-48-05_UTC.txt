So today, I decided to go to different barbershops and salons to add Sexual abuse to “barbershop talk”. The conversation definitely gave me a different perspective on the topic and why it’s not as easy or why men don’t want to talk about IT. I want to thank @furious_styles_midtown and the other barbershops for being open minded to the topic. Thank you @sirlancealot_cutz for this Poem supporting the cause to end #SexualAbuse! ✨Join us as survivors and advocates Men and Women at the 2nd Annual Powertalk event on Sunday, June 23, 2019 from 5:30pm- 9:00pm as we discuss our testimonies, struggles, and road to healing in hopes of strengthening the fight against sexual abuse! ✨

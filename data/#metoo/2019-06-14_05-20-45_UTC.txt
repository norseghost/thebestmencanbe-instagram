To all my #conservative friends listen and to any of my white brothers who don’t get it yet, you are not the center of the universe. Making sure that women are heard when sexual abuse happens isn’t an attack on all men, just the men doing the assault #metoo Making sure we protest and redress grievances to hold police accountable when they abuse their authority isn’t an attack on all police; just an attack on the ones who abuse their authority #blacklivesmatter Advice for not being a #racist or #bigot or #sexist etc, If the shoe doesn’t fit then great, but don’t get made because it does. #therealblexit #blexit #blexitscam #equalityforall

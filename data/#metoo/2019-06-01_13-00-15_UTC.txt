üìΩÔ∏è Hollywood has Georgia on its mind. Disney and WarnerMedia have joined Netflix in threatening to abandon their productions in Georgia over the state's controversial anti-abortion bill. Columnist Tara Lachapelle says this comes just as it‚Äôs starting to move beyond the allegations that detailed an entrenched pattern of sexual misconduct and inequality against women that tarnished the industry‚Äôs reputation. Although Hollywood is beginning to shift into a story of female empowerment, there's a long way to go. Last year, women comprised 40% of all speaking characters in broadcast, cable and streaming programs, a decline from 2017. "By perpetuating sexist views on camera, we‚Äôre also doing so in the real world," writes Lachapelle. #hollywood #metoo #georgia #abortion #women #femaleempowerment #empower #netflix #movie #film #tv #entertainment

So I recently came out with my #burnsurvivor story and #policebrutality story to @forcedtrajectory I honestly don’t like talking too much about my past as I still have a lot of #anxiety, #fearofcops and #stress.  In 2011, After a car accident I had a misunderstanding with metro cops.  I was held down on hot burning asphalt in Vegas August heat.  The asphalt #brutality my skin with 3 degree burns, as I was held in restraints not fighting back. I don’t do drugs and I don’t drink, I was acting strange after trauma from a car accident that left my car totaled and I was later diagnosed #bipolar.  I still not sure if I am #bipolar or I was have an allergy from #birthcontrol withdrawal too.  Eirther way what happened shouldn’t have happened.  I am very fearful for my community from #policebrutality. I believe my small stature and me being a female saved my life that day. #alllivesmatter #mentalhealthlivesmatter #blacklivesmatter #blacklivesmattersomylifematterstoo #metoo #supportasafecops #policebrutality #lasvegasvolience #donthateallcopsjustbadones #pleasekeepussafe

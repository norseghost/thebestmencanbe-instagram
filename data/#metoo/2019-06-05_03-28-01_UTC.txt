It is with SO much excitement and gratitude that I can finally make my long awaited announcement!

A lot of you already know that I have been wanting to tell my story; the story of how I have overcome so much adversity, yet still love life and all its offerings, to the absolute fullest. 
I am so incredibly fortunate to have been selected to co-author in a book filled with epic accounts of women who have done as I have done - Wise Women Rise (due for release early 2020) features a cohort of inspiring women who have faced significant adversity, yet they are telling their stories to inspire and empower others. 
The predecessor of this anthology, Dance In The Fire Of Life - Vicki Gotsis-Ceraso, has been a huge success, both in Australia, and internationally, and I am beyond excited to join this community of like-minded, brave, resilient thought leaders, and to watch the impact this new book will create in the lives of others.

I want to say a massive thank you to all who so generously donated to my GoFundMe cause, as without your help, realising this dream would not be possible ðŸ’œ

There is more VERY exciting news to come, but thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m giving you for now - youâ€™ll have to wait to hear what happens next ðŸ˜œ

THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THOSE WHO HAVE HELPED AND SUPPORTED ME IN THIS JOURNEY - I now get to give back ðŸ’•

EXHIBITION: Luke Parker, DUST, at Knulp Sydney, closed 2 June 2019 DUST is a set of photographic collages, constructed in-camera. The starting points are found analogue photographs from various sources that are re-photographed and enlarged as prints on paper. These blow-ups become backdrops for 3D arrangements of found objects including light-bulbs, lenses, acrylic sheets and film filters. The layering of translucent and other materials extends from recent experiments with photogrammetry. The photo/sculpture hybrids are then rephotographed from above, echoing the process of copy-stand photography. The resulting final images distil perceptual slippages between analogue and digital, between real and reproduced; they flatten 2D and 3D space, and confuse foreground and background. The works also create tension between the horizontal and vertical planes, and are displayed somewhere between the two states, on leaning, rough-cut plasterboard panels. These works seek to slow perception, especially in relation to photography which is so often (nowadays) a ‘quick’ visual medium. Rather than being a ‘pencil of nature’, or an apparatus for the representation of the ‘real’, I consider photography in terms of the complex effects it has on perception and visuality. Sulfur field 2019

Sometimes we have a close window in front of our eyes and we donâ€™t see the awful life we are living for...but just a lamp makes us discover the truth and we can finally run away ..it happened to me six months ago after years of emotional abuses received by a man who apparently was perfect , kind and nice ... a real hell..but now I am far away ..happy and ready to tell my story to give hope to other people ..soon a book ..god bless all of you ..happy Sunday @darkmoonlifemodel #darkmoonartist #metoo #drama #horrorfilm #realstory #book #abusedwoman #helppeople #helpwomen #sharelove #photo #scene #acting #model #pictures #doll

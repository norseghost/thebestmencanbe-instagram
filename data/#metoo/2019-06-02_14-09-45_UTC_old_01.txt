"Let the river run
Let all the dreamers
Wake the nation
Come, the New Jerusalem

Silver cities rise
The morning lights
The streets that meet them
And sirens call them on
With a song

It's asking for the taking
Trembling, shaking
Oh, my heart is aching

We're coming to the edge
Running on the water
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters"
-Carly Simon

Note: Someone just watched 'Working Girl' this evening and if you haven't seen it it, it is a delightful film from 1988 and I highly recommend you see it. #fistpump 👧👩👵👩‍⚕️👩‍🎓👩‍🏫👩‍⚖👩‍🌾👩‍🍳👩‍🔧👩‍🏭👩‍💼👩‍🔬👩‍💻👩‍🎤👩‍🎨👩‍✈️👩‍🚀👩‍🚒👮‍♀️🕵️‍♀️💂‍♀️👷‍♀️👸👳‍♀️🧕👱‍♀️👩‍🦰👩‍🦱👩‍🦳👩‍🦲👰🤱🤰🦸‍♀️🦹‍♀️🧙‍♀️🧚‍♀️🧛‍♀️🧜‍♀️🧝‍♀️🧞‍♀️🧟‍♀️🏃‍♀️💃 #nyc #statueofliberty #whorulestheworld

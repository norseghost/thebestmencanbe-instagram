Personal trauma, loss, mental illness - it all deserves time and respect but so do the families being torn apart at the border. \nEnvironment is crucial but the living conditions of those suffering in my city ( and our attitudes towards them ) needs to change too. \nSometimes thinking about all these things drains my energy - but then I have to remember this isn\u2019t about me, this is about our planet, not just the environment, but the collective - the body of human consciousness as a whole. \nSelective empathy is easy, it\u2019s influenced by media ( traditional and social ) and we\u2019re all susceptible, it\u2019s influenced by personal experience, it\u2019s influenced by visibility. \nI feel strongly about advocating for womxn and children, but in doing so, I should be advocating for womxn and children al over the world. \nIt can feel impossible - we can make excuses like \u201cI couldn\u2019t possible change the political landscape and suffering of all\u201d but the truth is there are things we can all do. We can make small donations to charities that know where to put there money ( I donate to Save The Chidren, UNICEF and amnesty international monthly - I know there are many other charities doing great work and some small charities are very deserving but these charities work, where the work is needed.), we can share and increase media coverage, we can spread a message of love and we can have faith that if we work on it, a collective consciousness of love will arise. \nIf we all do nothing, nothing will happen - BUT if we all do something then something WILL happen - it\u2019s that simple. \nI am a WHOLE woman and I have the caps ring to feel many things at once, to care about the health of my child, the state of my marriage - and the collective state of the world as a whole. \n#wearethewildwmn"

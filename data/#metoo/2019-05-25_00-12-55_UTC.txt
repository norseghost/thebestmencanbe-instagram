Feeling hopeful after testifying at today’s #HarassmentHearingNY, where @modelallianceny urged lawmakers to pass the Models’ Harassment Protection Act, legislation sponsored by @nilyrozic that will extend legal protections to models against workplace sexual harassment and discrimination. This is how change happens: stepping up together, making our voices heard, and demanding change from our elected leaders! #MeToo #TimesUp

Dear Deron,
•
Today is going to be the toughest day of your life. You won’t show it. You’re too stubborn for that. But this is going to hurt for a while.
•
In five hours, you’re going to show up to graduation and face him again. You’ll put on the white flag bearer’s robe. You’re going to take photos and crack jokes like usual. Once the cameras focus on the actual graduates, you’ll break character. It’s okay. You’re stronger than you think.
•
In a month, you’ll start the internship that changes your life in Dallas. It will weigh heavily on you, but you’ll still work extra days to distract you and get experience for the career you love. It will be on your mind every single mile you run for summer training — telling you to go faster. It’s okay. You have more endurance than you think.
•
In a year, you’ll graduate college. Your Big will be conspicuously absent after what happened. It will be a joyous day, but you will wish life played out differently. It’s okay. You’re happier than you think.
•
In two years, you’ll be faced with your toughest battle. You’ll talk of this night in hushed tones in a Denny’s. You sit through hours long conference calls pouring over every detail. You’ll fight off panic attacks at work as a result. You’ll finally call it what it was — rape. It’s okay. You’re tougher than you think.
•
In three years, you’ll know you’re truly in love. Your new job will be daunting, but you’ll find a way to juggle it all — even if no one knows the battle you’re fighting off camera. It’s okay. You’re more resilient than you think.
•
In four years, you’ll be mad it still bugs you. You’ll grow frustrated as you college welcomes him back as a hero in math and political science. But you’ll sit on your patio and type this out to yourself as a storm rolls in. It’s okay. You more at peace than you think.
•
The next four years will be hard. People won’t understand. They will tell you your pain is invalid because of your upbringing and many other things you can’t control. But the right people will listen. They will hear your story. And they will care. It’s okay. You’re surrounded by more honorable people than you think.

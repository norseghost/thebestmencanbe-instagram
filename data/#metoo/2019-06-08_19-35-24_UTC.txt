#glitterpainting by #feministasfuck @unicornkiller1 #MicolHebron (from my family’s art collection) - a replica / sendUP of the famed 1916 #KazimirMalevich #russianconstructivism work - from a large body of glitter paintings depicting the works of canonized MALE artists through HIStory. This work is as satirical as it is reverent and as sympathetic as it is loathsome. This project along with her @gallerytally Project shines a harsh light on male domination and the institutional subjugation of female voices. Micol is a patriot a veteran warrior serving on the front line of the fight for gender / sexual equality. I am proud to call her my friend but I have been fortunate to have her as my mentor. Micol invented the #malenipple project in reaction to social media’s punitive censorship of the depiction of female nipples. She printed small stickers of a male nipple, placing them on women’s breasts, as a humerus yet scathing critique of the #patriarchy and their grip on messaging - NOW, the artworld darling @spencertunick has coopted / stolen her message and uncredited, used it to advance his own art. Wake up... wake the fuck up... #METOO

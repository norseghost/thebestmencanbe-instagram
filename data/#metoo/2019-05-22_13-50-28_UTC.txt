“I don’t deserve this.” ⁣
“This won’t last.” ⁣
⁣
For the longest time those phrases haunted my thoughts and to this day I work diligently at feeling worthy and “safe”. ⁣
⁣
Unworthiness can show up in so many ways...Fear, Anger, Pain, Needing to probe yourself to others, grasping for a title to be seen, desperation, and more. ⁣
⁣
With the past I had, worthy and safe didn’t  necessarily play lead roles in my life. ⁣
Instead I learned a lot of fear, unworthiness, and pain. BUT guess what??? I’m SOOOO grateful for everything I endured...even the traumatic shit. ⁣
Why? Because it taught me so much and I know it all happened divinely as it was intended.⁣
It brought me to this very moment right now. It brought me to learn unconditional love with these two. ⁣
It taught me how to love my effing self!! ⁣
It taught me that safety doesn’t come from the love of another or from money. ⁣
It taught me that I’m strong and can overcome anything thrown my way. ⁣
I learned that everything is divinely orchestrated at a soul level and I’m always protected. ⁣
⁣
I learned I’m ALWAYS WORTHY & I’M ALWAYS SAFE because I’m divinity in form...JUST LIKE YOU!!! ⁣
⁣
You are all worthy and all safe! ⁣
I plan on showing those of you that are struggling with worthiness how to overcome that and step into your truth of LOVE & WORTHINESS. 💫💗💫⁣
⁣
Stays Tuned as I start to share even more of my heart and even more of this spiritual journey that’s changed my life in hopes to inspire you to make the changes needed to live the life you truly desire. #SoulUp ⁣

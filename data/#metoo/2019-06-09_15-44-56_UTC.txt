The Art of Silence is a masterpiece of contradictions. The title itself belies any advocacy of, any merit to, quiescence. The book is simultaneously a work of fiction and fact. The characters and the plot are products of both the author’s and readers’ imagination yet represent innumerable, all-too-real, issues throughout contemporary society that confront us all. Stoic endurance is proven to be neither a virtue nor strength of character, but can be a destructive weakness when it becomes embedded into our psyche.

Through 3d person and intertwined journal entries, combined with narrative commentary, this book has created a unique genre.

The writing is eloquent in its homespun, gritty, vernacular. An ideal, quick-read, “airplane book”, The Art of Silence” is a moving story on its surface, but deeply thought-provoking in its essence … ‘will find it’s a place as a dog-eared reference guide in anyone’s lives as the inevitable challenges of those lives arise. As spectators to the diaries and innermost thoughts of heroes, villains and victims alike, readers immediately become personally involved with the interactive elements self-evaluation, personal motivation and strategic planning necessary to enhance their own quality of life – to achieve their own self-fulfillment.

Fatima Alexander, whether she will admit or not, wrote this book primarily for her courageous son and from her own life experiences. Contrary to her stated intentions of addressing women’s issues and mental health, the principles apply to all genders, among all of humanity. 
She has identified the distinction between the Mona Lisa and street graffiti.

I was not raised by a man. I was raised by a woman. Most of the “men” in my life (not all) whether father figure or otherwise tried to control me. Make me little. Put me in a box. I literally had an uncle I have cut out of my life tell me to stop talking back to men because that’s why my last boyfriend attacked me. 
I am strong, resilient, independent and powerful because of my mother showing me it will be hard, but you can make it without one. It took her knowing what my ex step father did to me, but once she knew, she got out. She made sure none of us would have to deal with him again. So thank you for my strong mother who had to play both roles, and did so as best as she could with the tools given to her.

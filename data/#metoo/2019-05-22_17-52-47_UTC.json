Here are the risk factors for prenatal depression:\n\nA history of mental illness is not the only risk factor for #prenataldepression. \nOther risk factors include a history of adverse life events like sexual abuse, a lack of social support, and living in poverty. \nThere\u2019s also a hormonal component.There\u2019s evidence that hormone sensitivity in women during the reproductive life cycle makes some women vulnerable to mood disorders during any hormone shifts. So women who have a history of #premenstrualdysphoricdisorder (severe depression or anxiety the week before your period) or who react badly to hormonal birth control may be more likely to have perinatal mood disorders.\n\nIf you have a history of mental illness, start planning before you conceive. This may not be possible, as about 45 percent of American pregnancies are unplanned. But if you know you want to get pregnant, start working with a psychiatrist you trust. You want someone who will support you and your decisions around medication during pregnancy. One thing to consider is how severe your illness is. If you have been suicidal or hospitalized while off medication, you may not be a good candidate for going off meds.\n\nTo read complete article written by New York Times (@nytimes , click on the link in our bio!"

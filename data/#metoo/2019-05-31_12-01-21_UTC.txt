🌿 Money raised through fundraising efforts goes directly to the victims and their children, many of which live in poor rural communities and suffer from low levels of literacy and poor access to education, healthcare and other social services.

Justice for Lai Dai Han is currently raising money to pay for educational scholarships for young members of the Lai Dai Han community. To date, money raised has provided scholarships and helped to run education workshops in Qui Nhơn, Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh City. 🗣 Please support us and donate to make a difference - Link in bio!

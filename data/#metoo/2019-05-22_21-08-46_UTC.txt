1 in 6 men.  Are fans of basketball?  Are coffee drinkers?  Love long walks on the beach?  No, 1 in 6 men are sexually assaulted.  We can all say we know more than 6 men and yet I've never heard a man share their experience or say, “I'm 1 in 6.” For some reason our society would like to keep this behind closed doors.  1 in 6 men deserve to know that they are just as important.  That their stories matter and that they are not alone.  Sexual assault does not just happen to women, yet we build a no boys allowed club when we take a stand.  Men are assaulted too.  Do you know a 1 in 6?

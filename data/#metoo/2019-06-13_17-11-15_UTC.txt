• BREAK THE CHAIN OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE • -
-The first time I was sexually harassed, I was 6 years old. A classmate of mine made a disturbing comment about my body that shook me to my core. It made me feel uncomfortable, humiliated and somewhat guilty... The incident had a long-term effect on me: puberty became a threat because I knew it meant more people would start looking at me the same way that little boy did.

-Children will absorb and learn from the behavior of those around them. They’ll even appropriate things they don’t understand yet like sexual harassment. So, TEACH CHILDREN TO RESPECT ONE ANOTHER. We need to be open about respect. We need to be open about setting boundaries.

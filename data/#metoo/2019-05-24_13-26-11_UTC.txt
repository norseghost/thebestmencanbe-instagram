Had a great time recording with Lindsay Walden this week! We talked self-care, gratitude, trauma, celiac, couples counseling, how to talk to kids about sex, #metoo and much more. Check out the FB live recordings on Facebook.com/GetRealtoHeal. The episodes will air on 92.9FM and also be available on SoundCloud.com/GetRealtoHeal in a few weeks, so stay tuned. ♥️ #getrealtoheal #therapythoughts #progressnotperfection #talkradio #radio63119 #stlwellness #stl

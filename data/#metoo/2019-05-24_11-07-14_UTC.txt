Theresa May announced her resignation from Conservative and Unionist Party leader active Friday the 7th of June in what has been labeled a “dignified speech” by viewers early this morning.
"It will always remain a matter of deep regret for me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit," May said. May has been under pressure to resign as British Parliament has rejected her withdrawal agreement three times. Proposed compromises with the Labor Party also failed. The government’s representative in parliament, and one of the cabinet’s strongest supporters, Andrea Leadsom, resigned on Wednesday which may have been the straw that broke the camel’s back.
"It is now clear to me that it is in the best interest of the UK for a new PM to lead that effort," she said. Breaking her demeanor she broke down in tears and said that serving as Prime Minister was the “honor of my life.” She is the second woman to hold the position of the Prime Minister and stated in her speech she “will not be the last.”
May’s premiership has been short in comparison to others holding office historically. However, she will surpass Gordon Brown’s 2 years and 319 days on May 29th. May will remain Prime Minister until the next Tory leader is elected. ———-

“Healing is not a destination. Healing is the days I can’t get out of bed in the morning; it’s crying uncontrollably at the sight of a strawberry, it’s having a panic attack in a public place. Working through all of these moments IS healing.” - @taranajaneen, the founder of the #metoo movement (@metoomvmt).

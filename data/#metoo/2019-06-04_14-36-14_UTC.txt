Did you know that there is a difference between meteorological sesasons & astrological seasons? .
.

According to the #meteorological
season, summer started on June 1st and covers June, July, August... with the 1st day of fall being September 1st. 
According to the #astrological season, summer starts June 21st and runs until September 23rd. .

The reason I am telling you this is that we, humans, are all affected by the seasons differently. 
We might be feeling some new changing energy (like me!) and be feeling bad about it like - hey, I've been feeding myself and going on walks, what the heck body?! .
.

It's just the change of the season. Some seasons are for working, some are for playing, some are for resting, and some are for s l a y I n g. .
.

It's up to you to work with the energy, how it is, and not how you want it to be. 
Which is totally frustrating because I have b I g plans all year long. .
.

But, every year, my body "rebels" and I don't get all the things done because I am not working with what is really happening. Instead, I try and push and push and then I get sick and burnt out and no one has fun. .
.

I will remind us both: this year, each month, each season, keep some space for what your body is actually doing, what your body is actually needing. .
.

Work with your body. You will be so much more effective if you learn how to pause instead of ramp up... run... and then burn out. .
.
Let's do it together.

Last night I saw Eve Ensler speak for the third time. She is my personal SHEro and a woman I have leaned on through her writing in some of my most broken moments. She is an activist, a writer, founder of One Billion Rising and has committed her life to ending sexual violence against women and girls. Her message is getting louder and she is not only calling men to the stage, but she is so compassionately (yet fiercely) holding the broken hearts of men too. It was a complete honor to once again be in her space and being able to allow her words to wash over me like a warm bath of “I’m with you, sister. We’re in this together.” 🦹🏻‍♀️👊🏼🙌🏼

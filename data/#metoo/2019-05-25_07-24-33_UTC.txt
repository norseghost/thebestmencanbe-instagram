When I was four, I was tossed into a dryer and taken for a spin. The day went downhill from there. This block of memories took some time to process and I was unable to do laundry for weeks. 
I drew this in my sketchbook to give that broken little girl back her power. It was my version of dropping a house on the wicked uncle—as in “Ding Dong the Bitch is Dead”. This picture helps me glimpse the mischievous and curious little girl that was silenced into a state of fear and numbness. Good thing it’s rarely too late to have a happy childhood.  In the meantime, be on the lookout out for falling appliances!

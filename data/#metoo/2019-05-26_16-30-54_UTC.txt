Fame and greed tore their friendship apart.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
They haven’t spoken in decades ….⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Ever wondered what goes on behind closed doors when legendary bands meet up to discuss a reunion? What’s really going on behind the hugs and kisses at those reunion press conferences?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
THE THUNDER GIRLS were a successful ‘80s girl band until lead singer, Chrissie, sensationally quit the Band to pursue a solo career taking with her, Rick, the Band’s manager. Chrissie broke the Girl Code as Rick was also the boyfriend of Band mate, Roxanne.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
At the reunion dinner from hell, Chrissie tries to reunite the band to salvage herself from bankruptcy after being conned out of her fortune by her toyboy husband.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But is there a price which can heal the wounds?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Or maybe some friendships never die, even if you want them to?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
30 years later, can lightning strike twice?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

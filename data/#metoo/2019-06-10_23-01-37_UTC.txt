“This is one of those books that really hits home if you’ve had a terrible relationship. Not like a bad breakup over something stupid...but the kind where you’re totally convinced that this horrible person is your soulmate. Where they’ve brainwashed you so well that you’d jump the proverbial and literal bridge if they asked. I really became invested in the people and had a clear visual on them. There are moments I can relate to so exactly that it was hard to continue reading at times, but I’m really happy I did.” Candy Apple Butterscotch: A Memoir Available now! #fourstars #memoir #metoo #ptsdsurvivor “It’s WORTH THE READ It’s about a #woman #empowered and my God that is a #wonderful thing indeed” #linkinbio #authorsofinstagram #independentpublishing #goodreads #newbookalert #readforFREE

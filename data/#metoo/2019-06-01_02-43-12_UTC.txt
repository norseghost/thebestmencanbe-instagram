Stories of Animal Resistance are powerful forms of advocacy. Brianna's story continues to make waves and touch people's hearts. 
Let's ensure that we are centring animals in our advocacy. As allies in their fight for liberation let's highlight them as individuals with voices and agency, who actively resist their oppression, and are not passive victims of it. "The ones that muster up the courage to run away, are often pretty fiesty. It's funny because I'm surprised all the time by the animals, these escapees, and yet I'm not surprised at all. They're so individual. I'm sure she knew she was pregnant. You know, that maternal instinct. It certainly is nice to think that she knew, and I guess it's nice to think that she just wanted to live anyway." Video via @TheDodo

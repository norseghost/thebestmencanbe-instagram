When you peel back the superficial surface you will find most everyone has dealt with struggles and crisis in their lives. More than you even know. On social media people put their best foot forward and never talk about where they came from, what they have endured or maybe still even deal with. I just want to reach out to say whatever your going through your not alone. Whatever your facing that no one knows trust me you can get through this and you can and will overcome. Difficulties are not forever even though they seem like it st the moment. Just know that you can overcome and be there to help others going through the same things. Encourage everyone because you don’t know what they go through behind closed doors. There’s so much i want to say but there’s not enough time or space. I know this is a bit touchy but it’s something I feel strongly about having faced many things in my own life. . I’m always learning to deal with my past and difficult struggles I’ve faced and still deal with but I’m still fighting and im still here alive and breathing and trying to have a better more fulfilling life .

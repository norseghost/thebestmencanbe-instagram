Thank you thank you thank you to everyone that came today. I cannot even begin to explain how full my heart was to see so many people there today, so passionately fighting against this issue. The fight is far from over but I am filled with so much hope after today. 
When women’s rights are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back. 💪🏽

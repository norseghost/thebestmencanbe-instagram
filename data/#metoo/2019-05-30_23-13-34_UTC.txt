So many have absolutely no idea who 'our self' is. 
For so many that self was never nurtured when we were children. 
For so many of us that self was beat out of us.  Yelled and screamed out of us.  Maybe it was molested out of us or any other number of ways. 
Just because we're in this body doesn't mean we know who we are.  Just because we hear people talking about being yourself 'again' does not mean we remember a time when we were ever our 'self'. For some of us there's a long process in finding there is even a self inside.

I know. Because I climbed out of that pit.

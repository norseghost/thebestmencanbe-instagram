PSA: For my love of & in solidarity with my sisters & brothers who have experienced abuse on any level... Friends & family of the abusers... At some point you're going to have to deal with the fact that you know &/or care about an abuser, & how you feel about them or what you think you know about them, does NOT negate the fact that they are abusers. You can still love them but you do not have the right to deny the truth of their victim. Especially when they have proof.
.
Gaslighting 101, you see the abuse but you don't believe what you see because the abuser has told you it didn't happen. Guess what? That makes you one of their victims too & they need their faithful fan club to continue abusing other people.
.
Stop defending the bad & start standing up for the good people they hurt.
.
You know who you are & yes I am calling you out!

Good Morning My Fierce Fabulous Family  its Super Soul Sunday here's Today's quote .When an unpleasant incident occurs in our life, it is up to us how long we choose to grieve about it. Stronger is the man who feels the pain but decides to get up and move on. Life has much nicer gifts to offer in return of the losses you suffer. If you keep sitting and refuse to let go, how would you get those gifts just meant for you? So, take your time to heal and move on. Never stay down and relive the bad memories as they would just hold you back and not let you move forward.

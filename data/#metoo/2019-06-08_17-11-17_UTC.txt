Rp @the.undisputable.vegans Tess Thompson Talley, 38, defended her love of hunting in a CBS interview airing on Friday, saying: 'They [animals] are put there for us, we harvest them, we eat them!' In a pre-packaged segment, Talley was seen at her home in Odessa, Texas, where she was dressed in camouflage gear and filmed killing a wildebeest on a wildlife ranch.

When asked about the black giraffe she had killed during her gaming trip to South Africa, she laughed: 'He was delicious!' https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7116025/American-hunter-says-no-regrets-killing-black-giraffe.html?ito=social-facebook&fbclid=IwAR1LJsqbZDEXM3DBydtlwWnkwJtf8uLDAaAvX7-STji7KGnc7pYGeIYJ5fo

We were featured in the recent issue of the SAP PolitikBrief on “Mobile Technology in the Fight Against Sexual Violence” 
The article highlights WARIF’s partnership with SAP using the “People Connect 365” platform as a mobile technological tool to communicate with Traditional Birth Attendants(TBAs)  in rural areas, who have been trained by WARIF, through the @actfoundation_ sponsored Gatekeepers Project. These TBAs have been trained as first respondents on cases of rape and sexual violence in their  communities.

The platform enables the TBAs to communicate and report cases of rape and sexual abuse in real time to the WARIF Centre,  thereby ensuring that survivors in these remote areas are attended to more efficiently.

Using this software, WARIF has placed over 500 TBAs from 15 different local government areas in Lagos State on the platform.

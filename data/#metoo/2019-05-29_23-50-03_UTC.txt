As of yesterday, May 28, 2019, it has been five years since I have been in any type of romantic relationship with a man. (I'm a heterosexual woman.)
.
In those five years, I left a toxic job where I worked under a gaslighting narcissist and his dudebro cronies. I also watched in horror as the 2016 presidential electoral vote went to a serial abuser, assaulter, liar, and narcissistic conman. Along with scores of other womxn, I also fought to shine a light on the truth about sexual assault at the hands of men, telling my story despite the shame and pain. I also saw once again how my biological father continues to manipulate people and situations to his benefit.
.
I've tried to heal, but I'm left with nothing but anger. I now go to a job where I face the public, and almost every day, men call me "sweetie", "doll", "darlin'", "attagirl" (when I get something "right"), or something else equally as demeaning.
.
The worst, though, is when they do what a 60-something-year-old white man did yesterday, as he came up to my register:
.
"How about a smile for me, darlin'?"
.
My blood runs cold. I shake my head no.
.
"Oh, come on, honey! Just a little smile to make my day better!"
.
I feel my chest tighten and my face get hot.
.
"Aw, she'll smile for me," he says, motioning to the 60-something white woman next to him in line. "Yeah, life's too short!" she chirps. (Internalized misogyny is a bitch.)
.
I want to say something, anything, but I can barely speak. All I can do is finish the transaction as quickly and as professionally as I can. I want to tell the man how predatory he is. How creepy he is. How I will remember him and how he made me feelâ€”like I'm nothing, just a thing to satisfy him.
.
But he's just one. There are so many. With every word that drips like drool from their lips, they chip away at my strength, my resilience, my willingness to endure, until there's just a echoing space where any hope used to be.
.
I have nothing left for men. Nothing.

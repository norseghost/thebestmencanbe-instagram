I’ve spent so many years staying silent. my silence has created a barrier between me and the world around me. I’ve put up walls around my heart to protect myself from pain, without realising these walls would also prevent others from entering my kingdom. 
my silence has left me heartbroken. by suppressing my needs and not allowing myself to receive when given, my silence has caused me to live in fear. 
I want to break these walls down, I want to ferociously tear them down and rebuild a gorgeous golden gate, studded with black diamonds, opals and labradorite stones, decorated with feathers and latex and LOVE. I want to allow myself to love others deeper than ever before and to receive love from others in a totally new way. 
I’m afraid, I’m afraid of being hurt by not being loved in the same depth that I love, I’m so afraid of being hurt... but I’m choosing from this day forward not to allow this fear to control my life, my actions, my path. I am now aware of this fear and will use it to propel me forward, igniting my heart with deep, ravenous and untethered LOVE.*

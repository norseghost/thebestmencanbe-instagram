Although statistics on marital rape are hard to come by, one third of women who have been in a relationship say they have experienced physical or sexual violence at the hands of their intimate partner, according to the World Health Organization. To bring this into perspective for the Indian landscape, "cruelty by husbands and relatives under section 498‚ÄêA of Indian Penal Code is the major crime committed against women across the country, with 909,713 cases reported over the last 10 years, or 10 every hour." Please note that this statistic is particular to #DomesticViolence in India alone. The broader picture is that crimes against women are reported every two minutes, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of the last decade. That is how often people face incidents of sexual harassment and sexism on a day-to-day basis. If we just allow ourselves to dwell on this fact, we'll realise that victims of sexual violence are a part of our lives.

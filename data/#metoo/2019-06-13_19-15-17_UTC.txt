v overwhelmed by the support since I officially announced @wholetruthfilm on monday. this story has been brewing in me for nearly a year and seeing it come to life is truly special. the strong female characters, the all female crew, the subjects explored all align so strongly with my voice as an artist. the journey of these characters, of strength, trauma, acceptance, trust and healing is a universal one and one that is very close to my heart. childhood abuse is more common than we like to imagine and if my art can contribute towards the right conversations in a meaningful way and turn people towards empathy and advocacy, then I have achieved what I set out to do. so breathe and have faith that what is meant for you will never pass you by, everything happens for a reason and you are so much braver than you realise. 💙🧚🏻‍♂️🦋🐬🌊🌌/// @kaotherphoto

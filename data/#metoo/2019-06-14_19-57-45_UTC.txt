15 years ago I was sexually assaulted. With no dance background nor any especial passion for fitness, 10 years ago I curiously was drawn to and began teaching Pilates. 3 years ago I connected the dots: Pilates was alleviating my post-traumatic stress symptomology. .
.
Tomorrow, Saturday, 6/15, from 2p to 5p, I will be offering to survivors of sexual assault a bit of what Iâ€™ve learned from living with rape-related PTSD for 15 years, teaching Pilates for 10 of those years, trauma-informed coaching and sexual trauma research associated with my Masterâ€™s degree in Integrative Health Studies, 100+ hours of somatic continuing education, and my volunteership as a SART victim advocate. Yes, somehow I have condensed all of that info into 3 hours.
.
Location: Tomorrowâ€™s workshop will be held at one of the studios where I teach: @lapilatescarlsbad 2622-A El Camino Real in Carlsbad, CA. I chose the space as its energy has always promoted a felt sense of safety for me. We will be in the yoga room, which cannot be seen from the sidewalk or lobby, is away from street noise, and has light dimming capabilities. .
.
The grounding exercises and Pilates movement will take place on yoga mats, which will be provided, though you may bring your own. Participation in exercise and movement is not required. Listening, observing, notes: all totally fine. There will be a bit of empowering trauma and Pilates education woven into the matwork. Handouts including guidance through the exercises we will be trying out in the workshop and other resources will be provided. .
.
The purpose of this workshop is to offer support, however you need it. It is an opportunity to be with other women who can relate to your experience and you to theirs. Though trauma creates a response unique to the individual, I think we all have experienced isolation in some way, shape, or form due to the stigma embedded in sexual trauma.  Along with the compassionate souls at @honeyorg , I hope you will join us. Feel free to bring any practitioner you might be working with. This workshop is open to them as well. The only restriction is that it is for women only. For a link to register, please go to @honeyorg Limited space!ðŸ’«

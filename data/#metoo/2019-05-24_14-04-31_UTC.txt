CLARY SAGE and ISIS make a formidable team. One of the qualities of Clary Sage that became apparent whilst dancing Qoya today was her incredible ability to support ‘transitions ‘. @kerrypocockcoach talked about her experience of using Clary Sage as a doula: to help the woman and baby through transition.

Transition is often the part where we connect to our wildest, most primal part in giving birth. Today’s Qoya was that. No babies were birthed but new chapters, new stories, new mindsets truly were. 
Clary Safe you are a powerhouse. I need you in my life. As I danced today, my body burned feverishly hot: deep transition. It’s so welcome. It is time. I’m so grateful for this remembering.

Last nights safer artistic spaces community conversation and social hour at the @lulalounge was transformative. @musicgalleryto and the DI have been partnered for a year working to create tools, practices, policies and supports to create safer spaces for all music gallery communities and staff! David and Kayla are great leaders and have worked tirelessly to make music gallery a safer space. Our panelists  @chippyxnonstop @queenofswordsband @venusfestival @djmetime , David from music gallery and our ED Viktoria Belle discussed inclusive practices, community accountability, power, sexual violence, resources and tools to create safer spaces! To all the audience members and to all the people who supported us and this event thank you! The Lula lounge is lucky to have Sara, Nicole, Vas and Tracey, Kayla from music gallery thank you endlessly for your leadership and to all survivors, last night we saw the power of education as a form of resistance to sexual violence! Keep the conversations going and share knowledge with one another. #lgbtqðŸŒˆ #community #saferspaces #dandelioninitiative #timesup #ordersup #metoo #survivorscantwait #thrive #resistance #consentmatters #bebetter #changeisgood #listen #toronto #ontario #canada

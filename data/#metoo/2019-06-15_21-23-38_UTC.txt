So all the fe...oh no, that also ends with "MALE".
तो सारी लड़कि..shit! हिंदी में तो पूरा शब्द ही वही है, बस मात्रा अलग है!
तो सारी महिलायें..fuck. The Hindi Alphabet is same for them as well!
Sorry to not address the other gender (oh no, that's not specific now as well, TikTok waale are included in this).. To hell with this.
Since these FEMINAZIS are not gonna allow me to use anything common with the male gender to address females, (Oh man!! I used it! Now they'll call me a fucking misogynistic pervert molester pig and file a fake assault case on me!!) sorry to not address you, girls, because language is something all men use, but I can't address you people using anything common between us.
So now these "womyns" (or whatever be the plural) will discriminate against us with such severity, defame us to DeFeAt PatRiArChY and MiSoGyNy, and shame our families and upbringing without any reasons, and once we raise our voice, #metoo happens, DiGnItY oF WoM"Y"n and FrEeDoM oF ExPreSsIoN is affected.
Pata nahi mujhe hi kitni gaaliyan padne waali hain!
Bring it on, Feminazis. I'm ready. (PS: Fighting for Women Empowerment and equality is valid, not for "WoMYn" domination.)

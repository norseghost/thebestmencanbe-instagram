This picture was taken just as the fog of being a new mom began to lift a little.
.
When Aiden was born, I experienced the baby blues which quickly developed into deep postpartum depression.
.
Those early days were rough. I never experienced depression that low and I've been suffering with depression and anxiety since I was five years old.
.
I came across essential oil's just by scrolling on facebook one night. A mother was posting about how it helped her. I tried store bought essential oil's beforr but they never did much for me.
.
I had heard about Young Living wondering if the money was even worth it. Wondering if these will help me struggling so bad with my emotions.
.
I bought the kit and my first love was Lavender. I diffused it ALL the time for Aiden and I. I felt more like myself every day.
.
Over the past two years, I taught myself about health and wellness in a deeper level. Developing myself as a person and taking better care of myself physically.
.
There is a time and place for doctor's but we always resort to holistic remedies first. God gave us both for a reason.
.
Investing in your own health is never too expensive, there is only priorities. .

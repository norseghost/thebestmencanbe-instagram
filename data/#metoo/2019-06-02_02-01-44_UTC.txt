“There was nothing for all was dark and chaotic. Then out of the chaos there emerged a sigh. And this sigh became a moan and this moan became a wail and this wail became a scream of birth. ⠀⠀
And mighty was this birth for it was the birth of the Universe.”

Opening tomorrow at noon! Don't miss it: "Judy Chicago: the Birth Project from New Mexico Collections." ⠀⠀

When your daughter is really sad ... yet again ... that she’s the only one in the family with curly hair so you let her help you curl your hair despite the fact that you have a HUGE undercut and you know it’ll look shit 😆🤦🏻‍♀️💔💙🥰 then she still asks you to straighten her hair! This girl has me wrapped round her little finger! And I wouldn’t have it any other way 💖

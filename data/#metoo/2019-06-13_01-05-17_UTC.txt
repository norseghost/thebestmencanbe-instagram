a lot of times in communities of color, we carry the stories of our parents and ancestors on our paths to success/purpose. these stories can motivate us, but if  carried the wrong way, our own interpretations can weigh us down. 
my grandmother didn’t get to finish her primary school education. sometimes I think, “she didn’t struggle to get to America to watch me pass on the opportunity to go to law school”

my friend was planning to buy her first place but she’s hesitant to leave her parents. she asked me, “how can I splurge on vacations and an apartment when my father worked 3 jobs to put me through school? If I move out I can’t help them financially”

in breaking generational curses and elevating our families/communities, sometimes I wonder how we can carry these stories with us in a way that empowers us-without the emotional weight of fearing their wasted sacrifice or feeling there are obligations attached (and still honoring their experiences) 
like the fancy graphics you’ve been seeing on Instagram will remind you, remember that you are your ancestor’s wildest dreams (even without the Ph.D. at the end of your name)

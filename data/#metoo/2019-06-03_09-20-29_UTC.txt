This week I have a book - Beyond All Reasonable Doubt - released in the US. Among all the wonderful reactions, @nytimes bookreview highlights the novel’s relevance to the #metoo discussion and says (about my lawyer Sophia Weber) that her quest to get justice for her client - convicted for the murder of 15 year old Katrin - is “less like a march to righteousness than a battle that no one entirely wins, whatever the outcome in court”. And I think that description comes quite close to what I tried to say with the novel. And the fact that I wrote it in 2011, six years before #metoo actually happened just makes it better. Because it gives me the unrivalled pleasure of saying I TOLD YOU SO (or something along those lines). @otherpress @penguinrandomhouse #ahlanderagency

Women's Newspaper was launched in March 1971 to coincide with the first Women's Liberation March. The paper ran for only three issues and we are selling all three. The tone is angry and radical, addressing problems such as equal pay, race and the Miss World beauty contest. Although the paper is of its time, many of the issues raised still resonate today. On our website and our new Instashop.

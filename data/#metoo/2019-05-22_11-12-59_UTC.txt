A great article that I hope others will read. Check it out here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/06/23/why-many-rape-victims-dont-fight-or-yell/

It is a lot of stress to not only be assaulted but to then have people question you when you were scared the hell out of your mind. This makes so much sense. In split seconds I had to understand what a rational human being was doing and make sense of their irrational behavior, especially when it’s someone you know. There’s that moment where that person you trust and hang out with, who has never done anything like this before, does something way out of social norms, especially in relationships (of any sort). Changing the narratives (that are based on false information anyway, or a lack of information) will help end the stigma and allow victims to heal. Let’s get on that!

I highly recommend sharing articles like this with others and being a fellow #advocate to end rape, harassment, abuse, and just overall misogyny and pain. #metoo #endrapeculture #jointheconversation #letstalkaboutrape

Thanks for your concern over my last post..some of you reached out personally to see if I was ok and I am touched and grateful to have so much love! I love you too and Iâ€™m ok and thereâ€™s no need to be alarmed! I think itâ€™s fine and necessary to share vulnerable moments in our lives. Itâ€™s a pretty epic struggle to try to make it as a singer-songwriter alone and sometimes the obstacles I face seem to knock me down before I figure out a way to rise above them. Do you know what Iâ€™m talking about? We are united and equal in this way..we are all fighting a secret battle nobody knows about..but why make it worse by hiding? I want to share my truth with you and yes sometimes itâ€™s pretty dark because Ive survived some serious shit #metoo and come out on the other side with a song and fire in my soul that keeps me going! Itâ€™s out of the darkness where I often find inspiration and strength and music to get me through. I feel gratitude for the process however painful it may be at times. #phoenix It helps to know I have you here to remind me of love and connection. Thanks and keep rocking and shining on you your beautiful, bumpy journey ðŸŽ¶ - #shineon -

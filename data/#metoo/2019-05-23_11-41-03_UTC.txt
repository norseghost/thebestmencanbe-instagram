This is the conversation I had with another #victim after watching #BBCPanorama last night about #abuse on those with #learningdisabilities. Myself and two other autistic women suffered #sexualabuse and #sexualharrassment by a member of staff whilst living at @ability_housing_association and managers brushed it under the carpet and #victimblamed 😡 I still suffer severe #PTSD now and it was #horrific for all of us. Care staff will continually get away with #abuse on #vulnerableadults especially when everyone else in the establishment protects them. We were there for a reason in that #carehome needing #careandsuppprt because of #complex problems and we were taken full advantage of! 😥😡

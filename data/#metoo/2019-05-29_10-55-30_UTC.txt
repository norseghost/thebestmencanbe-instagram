THE GIRL AT THE  DOOR (ARC)

What do you do and who do you believe when a girl shows up at your front door to say your fiance, who was her Professor raped her?

That's the hardness that Veronica Raimo's "The Girl at The Door" opens with.
ðŸ“š

But in a twist, the book doesn't quite continue with the development of the dynamic of what happened between the girl and the Professor. It focuses instead on the Professor and his fiancee, who are expecting a baby and incorporates what happened into their own story as a couple. ðŸ“š

The book refers to them as her and him throughout and they live in an idyllic society, a place called Miden and the issue goes to the Commision where it is being thrashed out with questioners to fill, witnesses to speak and so on. 
It is a perfect holiday read, I think, even though it explores a difficult theme. 
I have to be honest and say it wasn't exactly what I was expecting when I started out reading this. There's a curve the book takes that I can't really explain. ðŸ“š

Something stood profound for me in the scene where the Professor's fiancee asks the girl questions that are common with rape cases especially in the media and the Internet. The "Why didn't you report" questions, the "why now" questions.
The girl responds by saying she did not know then that what she was being subjected to was violence.
This begs the question - At what point is an assault really an assault, especially with someone that you are in a sexual relationship with? Can this be manipulated years down the line? How do you know what to do now that won't get you in trouble when there's an awakening or better consciousness say ten years down the line?

Vanity Fair (Italy) has called this novel the first Post-Weisntein novel. It is translated from Italian and I feel like perhaps a bit may have been lost in translation seeing as the English language often doesn't capture the essence of other languages. Nice read and it is out on the 13th of June. Thank you @livmarmar  for sending me an advance copy and very promptly too. 
Also, what is this creepy cover? Hahaha.

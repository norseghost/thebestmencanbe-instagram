I\u2019ve been working with my oldest on adjectives to describe people other than their race or gender to push her to use adjectives that better describe the person. I hope to encourage my girls to be mindful of the impact their words have on a person. \nAsk a person\u2019s name \nEngage in conversation \nIf the name is not known discover different ways to describe a person that is not offensive. \nThough kids may not mean harm sometimes their words can cut and as their parent I want my girls to be able to see different cultures but also recognize the uniqueness of the individual before them and treat them with respect. \nTrying to avoid what may feel uncomfortable I would be limiting the opportunity for good to come from these situations and conversation. \nMy girls have a lot of questions and I\u2019m determined to give them answers and learn in the process. There\u2019s a lot of loud negative noise out there and the current narrative does not speak for me or what I\u2019d like my children to learn. We are figuring out what works for us every day. We are all doing our best, you don\u2019t have to change the world all at once just start with your own kids and go from there. \u270c\ud83c\udffe\ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\udc96 #enjoylearning"

I was held against my will for two months in Kashmir. Near the Pakistan border. It is a very 
dangerous place. During that time, I was continuously sexually and physically assaulted. Shortly after 
my return, I was led to believe, by someone that I looked up to at the time, that everything was all 
my own fault. 
This is why it became extremely difficult for me to talk about for so many years. It is also why I found 
it hard to go to court and have these two men put away for life. I was told by the embassy that if I 
went to court, this is what will happen to these men. I actually thought at the time, “how can I 
punish these men for something that I had let happen to me?”!!! Can you believe that?! If only I 
could go back in time and shake myself a little gently and tell my younger self that what they did to 
me was on them not me! 
I held everything in and kept it private. I hid myself away from the world and I silently punished 
myself for fifteen years without even knowing it.
After writing my memoir, getting everything out and clearing everything up, I’m now on the path of 
putting the pieces back together that I had destroyed due to guilt, anger and fear towards myself.
I finally feel free to be open about my story and this is why I’m so excited to be sharing the whole, ‘uncut’, full-disclosure version of how all of this came about in my life and how it has rendered gifts 
so powerful that now I’d never want to change a thing.
I am so excited to be soon releasing my memoir A Dangerous Pursuit to Happiness.

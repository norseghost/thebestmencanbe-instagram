Courtney Herron is the fourth woman to be found dead in a public space in Melbourne in the past twelve months. Courtney deserved better, as did every woman who has lost her life to gender-based violence. As her friends have said, she will “be remembered by her smile because you would see it every day without fail”.

Courtney also had significant challenges in her life and was homeless at the time of her death, which made her particularly vulnerable. As Homicide Squad Detective Inspector Andrew Stamper has said, “we as a community should be protecting these people and we didn't. We failed on this occasion”. It is so important that all people are protected from violence, and we need to do more to protect vulnerable communities.

As a society, we also need to address the links between domestic violence and homelessness. The two issues are connected, with 1 in 3 young people approaching  homelessness services for support having experienced domestic violence. Domestic violence has been identified as one of the leading causes of homelessness in Australia.

As we grapple with the news that yet another woman has been failed in this city, let us reflect on how we can do more to protect women, including women who are vulnerable because of their circumstances in life. See our stories for some ways to support.

Eve Enslerâ€™s play The Vagina Monologues was first performed in 1996 and became a worldwide phenomenon. 
The playwright and activist's recent book, The Apology, is an imagined letter from her father apologising to her for a lifetime of devastating sexual, physical and emotional abuse. "All my childhood I waited for an apology from my father, I dreamed it would come, then he died and it's been 31 years since his death but there's still this yearning that someday this apology is going to arrive from heaven."
On Wednesday's Woman's Hour, Eve told Jenni Murray why she's written the book from the perspective of her father and why it might provide a blue-print for apologies in the #metoo era.

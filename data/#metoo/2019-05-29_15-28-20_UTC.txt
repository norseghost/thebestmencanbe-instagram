“I had just bought this bright pink denim jacket from Levi’s. It was a big purchase for me, but I had made some extra money babysitting and wanted to splurge. I was wearing it with leggings and a long black tee and black slides. As I was walking home, I felt someone stepping on the back of my shoes. Assuming it was just a rushing New Yorker, I hurried my steps. Then I felt this man walk into the side of me. He grabbed my backpack and said, “Hey.” He was wearing a suit and sounded drunk. No one around me even seemed to notice. I swerved away and he said, “Wow.” I was walking fast now, but he kept following and calling at me. I didn’t know what to do, so I just kept walking faster, trying to put as many people in between us as possible. I cursed at myself for buying a jacket that stood out so much. I knew he’d be able to see me from blocks away. I started to cry as I rushed through the city. Luckily, I lived in a dorm, so I knew I’d have a doorman, but what if I didn’t?” - anonymous

Labor officials, trade unions, and employersâ€™ associations from around the world are meeting at the International Labor Conference in Geneva to negotiate a new international treaty on workplace harassment and violence. The proposed treaty, and an accompanying non-binding recommendation, would provide long-overdue concrete guidance on steps governments should take to protect workers from harassment and violence. Help us spread the word and urge governments to better support increased protections for workers around the world! #labor #laborrights #ILOEndGBV #timesup #metoo #StopGBVatWork

#MyDarkVanessa looks incredible. I have been coveting these dark & delicious proofs from @4thestatebooks and I have finally obtained* one. 
That disturbing long red plait. Those colours: bright teal, a creepy skin-coloured peach. That blurb. That quote on the front. 
The plot: A woman is asked to re-define the great coming-of-age love story of her teenage years as rape, in the light of a sexual assault trial. Was it love, or was she groomed? And in the wake of #MeToo, what are the boundaries? 
Described as â€˜An era-defining novel cutting to the heart of some of the most complex issues of our ageâ€™ this book is set to be shit. Hot. ðŸ”¥

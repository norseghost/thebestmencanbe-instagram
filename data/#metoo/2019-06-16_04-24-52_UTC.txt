"My self worth was tied up in whether or not men desired me. So, I put myself out there over and over again. That was my self-harm. I kept seeking ways to continue the abuse my dad began. Because I was conditioned to believe my only worth came from being sexually available to men. That sex = love. My dad taught me that what he did to me was love, and I had no idea it wasnâ€™t normal. Not until much later. By then, however, the damage was done. Since no one talked to me about the abuse, even after it stopped, and I was never provided any kind of counseling, I acted the only way I knew how."

Trying to push through the last of this  Chemistry and A&P really at my wits in with this Shit. Hopefully Pride will be fun in a couple weeks and I can meet some other gay Veterans or get a date or find a reason to  keep living and trying when none of my efforts are paying off. Honestly I would rather be dead then I  won't be lonely but might as well finish this semester as strong as I can.

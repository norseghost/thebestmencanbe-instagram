There were no boundaries.  No privacy.  I couldn’t enjoy personal writings.  Nothing was off limits.  I have trouble opening up to people so this is my way of doing that.  I had to keep so many secrets of abuse to myself.  I had to kept my insights silent. 🔐 #emotionalabuse #iwasmuted @imachildabusesurvivor

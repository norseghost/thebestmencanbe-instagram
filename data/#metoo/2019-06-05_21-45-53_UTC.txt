Instagram friends! I'm looking for portrait volunteers to be part of my next series - 50 portraits in 50 days for the Sanchez Art Center. If you're interested, here's how to participate: DM me a selfie and a description of your #metoo experience. I won't be disclosing names & if you want to crop your selfie so you can't be identified, that's ok too! This is open to everyone, and I'll take this post down as soon as I have 50 participants. THANK YOU to those of you who already sent me your selfies and stories, I am sending you many internet hugs ❤❤❤❤ Feel free to ask me any questions below & share this post with anyone who might be interested in participating! xo Diana

We wanted to share an exciting update from one of our project grant awardees, BlurredLines founded by changemakers Vinuri Dissanayake, Sophia Lane and Laura Russo.⠀
⠀
Over the past year BlurredLines has been working with high schools in Washington DC, USA. The goal of these workshops was to get an understanding of what girls have to face with regards to sexual assault in their communities, at home and at school. ⠀
⠀
They conducted weekly workshops through the school year, educating girls (grade 9-11) about understanding consent, healthy relationships and victim blaming. It was also an opportunity for them to really dive into issues these girls are facing today such as sexting, child pornography and trafficking, to name a few. ⠀
⠀
The #MeToo era focuses on bringing light to sexual assault and consent education, but without truly understanding the challenges faced by the younger generation such as social media abuse, lack of trust with police and victim blaming among friend groups we cannot effectively empower girls to speak up about abuse and encourage reporting. ⠀
⠀
Using their knowledge, BlurredLines is working to solve the challenge of consent education. ⠀

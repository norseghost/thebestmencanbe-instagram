The feminist Iliad. Song of Achilles meets #MeToo. I’ve heard this book described in various pithy ways and it’s true: this different perspective on the Trojan War is a manifesto for female survival, empowerment and remembrance. Unlike Circe or Song of Achilles, two recent retellings by Madeline Miller that I loved, The Silence of the Girls has little to do with the ancient Greek Gods, but rather is very much focused on the humans—the foul, flawed, brutal, selfish men who fight the wars and make their conquests, and more significantly, the women who are their captive commodities, to be used and abused, again and again, as slaves, prostitutes, and even wives and mothers to their children. Pat Barker pulls no punches as she tells the story of Briseis, the captive queen awarded to Achilles whom Agamemnon also covets. Later in the book, she weaves in some very affecting narrative from Achilles’s perspective, but the majority of the eloquent story is focussed on bearing witness to the tragedy and suffering that is war to women.
(One criticism I’ve heard is the anachronistic dialogue—characters sound like contemporary Brits rather than ancient Greeks. Didn’t bother me, once I was used to it.)
Highly recommend, and I will be checking out other books by this acclaimed author. #thesilenceofthegirls #patbarker #classics #retelling #trojanwar #theiliad #greekmyths #feministfiction #bookreview #iamreading #readingnow #justread #booklife #bookstagram #readmore  #bookaddict #booksofinstagram #reader #igreads #book #bookstagrammer #booklife #bookish #booklove #bookreader #bookaholic  #borntoread #readersofinstagram

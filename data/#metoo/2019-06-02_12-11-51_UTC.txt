66 Years Ago Today, the coronation of Elizabeth II took place at Westminster Abbey, London. (2 June 1953)

Some Facts about the Coronation:

Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne at the age of 25 upon the death of her father, George VI, on 6 February 1952, being proclaimed queen by her privy and executive councils shortly afterwards.

The coronation was held more than one year later because of the tradition of allowing an appropriate length of time to pass after a monarch dies before holding such festivals. It also gave the planning committees adequate time to make preparations for the ceremony.

During the service, Queen Elizabeth took an oath, was anointed with holy oil, invested with robes and regalia, and crowned Queen of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon - now Sri Lanka.

Prince Charles received a special hand-painted children's invitation to his mother's Coronation.

There were more than 2,000 journalists and 500 photographers from 92 nations on the Coronation route.

The Coronation Bouquet was made up of white flowers – comprising of orchids and lilies-of-the-valley from England, stephanotis from Scotland, orchids from Wales, and carnations from Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.

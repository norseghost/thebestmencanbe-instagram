"Tangled" is the piece I made for the exhibition we're holding this week at The Open Market in Brighton. There you will  find amazing works from very talented group of sculptors. ðŸ’ª. So pop to have a look! Is a very public and community space, so eeeevery body is welcome!
Also, very happy to have my piece located in front of @wastenot_shop and @radioreverb as the concepts of my piece are very well matched. Couldn't find a better spot! .

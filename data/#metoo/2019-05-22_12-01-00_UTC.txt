As we begin pre-production for #TheFruitofOurWomb, we will continue our #AwarenessWednesday campaign, which promotes local charities who support women, non-binaries, LGBT youths and the homeless.

This week, our focus is Women In Need. WIN began as a shelter in 1983 and has since evolved to become a leading, non-profit agency and the largest provider of shelter for homeless families in New York City, serving close to 10,000 homeless women and their children each year.

Please visit their website to learn more about the comprehensive programs and services they provide, and how you can support this wonderful cause: winnyc.org

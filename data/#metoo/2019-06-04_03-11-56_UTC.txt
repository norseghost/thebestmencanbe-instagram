What am I thinking right now, how some of you are 𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗜𝗣𝗣𝗘𝗗 of your sexual expression and fullest expression. 
It’s easy to dress sexy and talk positions, but I want to you to get intimate with who you are. 
Last night I was listening to my friend Vanessa Petronelli and her channeling experience. 
I asked her guides this question: “I’m in the leadership of sexuality and noticing a lot of conflicts with the masculine and feminine. 
I am curious of the current climate for the masculine and feminine. How can we let go of the fear of the #metoo movement causing for the new relationships?” Her response from the Pledians is “what’s happening between masculine and feminine is the core wounding to come into sacred union within yourself.” What this means to me is to stop 🛑 calling in love, thinking about love, sending love. 😱“WTF Erikaa why are you teaching about sacred sexuality if you are saying and believing those things?” First, I AM LOVE ♥️🤗 You are love.🌸
You are sex. 🌸
You are that life force. 🌸
with or without clothes.🌸 My unique approach to what’s working and not working in terms of sex is a blend of getting real, being present, and start choosing differently. 
We first are not going to talk about 😱Technique.
😱Positions.
😱BDSM.
😱Tantra breathework.

We first must get intimate...in terms of stripping your conditionings from the old paradigm... Retraining the mind to be in your body. 
Letting go of strategy and hacking your way through system of being be a SEX GOD or close to it. 
Before we start, you must find yourself getting REAL while 𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗜𝗣𝗣𝗜𝗡𝗚 away your old beliefs about sex and love from the old paradigm. 🥰Get REAL with your magnificence 🥰Get REAL that I’m giving you what you need, not what you want. 🥰Get real that you must 𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐈𝐏 yourself of the old paradigm to step into the new paradigm. 🥰Get real you didn’t grow up knowing you were loved...You grew up knowing you needed to earn it.

They walk away being 𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐈𝐏𝐏𝐄𝐃 of their conditions around sex, money, and creative blocks.

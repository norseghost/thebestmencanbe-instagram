What are the systems that come into play in order to help a child to survive psychological trauma, and how do these systems limit later development?\u2019 A psychological survival system kicks in and the problem is that because the child is so young this survival system has only a very limited number of options available to it. After all, a normal reaction to unbearable pain is to withdraw from scene of injury. Because the child is highly dependent and can\u2019t leave, a part of the self withdraws instead, and for this to happen the psyche splits. One part regresses back to a time of relative innocence, before the trauma and one part \u201cprogresses\u201d, i.e., grows up very fast.\n\nThe essence of the child \u2013 the creative, relational, authentic spark of life which is at the very core \u2013 goes into hiding, deep in the unconscious. At the same time, another part of the child\u2019s psyche \u2013what Winnicott called the \u201cfalse self\u201d\u2014 grows up prematurely and becomes a rigid adaptive self, complying with outer requirements as best it can, while protecting the lost core of the self by hiding it.\n\nThe initial moment of psychological dissociation is a miraculous moment in that this defensive splitting saves the child\u2019s psychological essence in an encapsulated state, but it is also a tragic moment because with this splitting the child steps out of the reality and vivacity of his or her life. It is a moment when the child separates from experience, goes into trance, and when the child\u2019s capacity for genuine and trusting human relationships starts to disintegrate.\n\nDissociation is an unconscious process that goes on outside awareness. It seems to be a hard-wired capacity in the human psyche....like the circuit breaker installed in the electrical panel of a house. If too much current comes in (trauma) the circuit-breaker trips.\n\nThe painful experience continues but it is not happening to \u201cme\u201d. We now know that the painful experience does not disappear but is encoded in the body and the unconscious brain.\n\nIf a child\u2019s life is sufficiently traumatic to require a lot of dissociation, and if the painful experiences have not \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd"

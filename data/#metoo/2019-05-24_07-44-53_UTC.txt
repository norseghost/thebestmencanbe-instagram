@metro.co.uk you do realise that we’re not living in the 1950s? To perpetuate the notion that the elected leader of our nation needs her husband to step in and persuade her to quit is frankly patronising and sexist, and using Iain Duncan Smith as your primary quote! I do not agree with May’s policies or brexit, but I feel very angry this morning that a well known paper would contribute to such a damaging narrative. Shame on you. #everydaysexism #metoo #feminism  #womensrights #womenempowerment #sexualharrassment #equality #equalrights #timesup #women #girls #girlpower

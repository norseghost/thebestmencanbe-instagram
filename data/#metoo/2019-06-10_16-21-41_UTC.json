                        "text": "This is my little girl Camille. One day, in the non too distant future, my little girl will become a woman. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nI, of course, hope nothing ever happens to her. However, as she becomes a woman, I would like to think that if she was harassed or worse at work, people would  listen to her and believe her when she spoke.\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nUnfortunately, in our current atmosphere, this is not guaranteed.\u2063\n\u2063\nRecently there has been much talk about the USC cardiology fellow who SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 3 female trainees. One of the trainees had the courage to report it. Result? she gets no support and is put in doubt. Per the LA TImes she alleged in court papers that one of her mentors said to her, \u201cYou knew what you were doing.\u201d\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nThe accreditation council for Graduated Medical Education decides that to revoke the programs accreditation which will effectively shut down the cardiology fellowship. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nLast week, an op-Ed published in doximity discussing the case of USC. The writer believes that shutting down the program is too harsh and he victimizes the attacker.Even worse, comments on the article by a FEMALE recommends that the trainees \u201ctoughen up\u201d\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nWHAT?!? How can this be? When did we normalize sexual assault? When did \u201ctoughening up\u201d become the solution to this problem? And why do we continue to believe attackers over victims?\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nIt baffles and angers me that we continue to condone this behavior in medicine and many other fields. We doubt victims, creating a horrible cycle where victims just stay quiet and perpetrators run free because why bother if nobody will believe me and then imply I asked for it or calls me a slut? Perpetrators aren\u2019t held accountable, so the cycle repeats. It is shameless and horrifying.\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nLadies, if we want to \u201ctoughen up\u201d and \u201cgrow some ovaries\u201d (let\u2019s face it, they are more resistant than balls), let\u2019s listen to the victims. Let\u2019s support and believe them, stop shaming and let\u2019s have the courage to put down bullies. It\u2019s the only way we can grow and empower each other. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#listentoher #sheforhe #empowerwomennow #respectwoman #believeher #protectwomen #timesup #timesuphc #medical #metoo #uscscandal #protectourgirls #timesuphealthcare"

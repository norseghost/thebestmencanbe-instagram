PROFESSOR CALLAHAN
is a fictional character in the movie Legally Blond (2011) His actions are clearly sexual harassment and a violation of Title IX which prohibits sex discrimination on school campuses. The fact that Elle Woods doesn't immediately report him for harassing her and instead decides to drop out of law school is a realistic chain of events, and indicates a much larger problem on America's college campuses. He got away with it. AMAZING!

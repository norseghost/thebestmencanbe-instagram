Have plans tonight? If not, stop by and support this event put on by Womankindâ€™s Youth Ambassadors.

This year, they've collaborated to host a night of poetry, art, and music to honor the stories of survivors and allies from historically marginalized backgrounds. The event will be a space for survivors, activists, and allies to build a sense of community and empowerment in the wake of the#MeToo movement. We hope you will be able to join us. Light bites and mocktails will be provided. The event will start promptly at 6pm and performances around 7pm. Hope to see you there!

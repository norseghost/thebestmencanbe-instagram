"Just as we adults push young people to the side and treat them as less important, we also have not made childhood epidemics a priority." Prompted by the relatively few news stories during April (Child Abuse Awareness Month) focused on prevention against the background of the constant coverage of high profile cases of abuse, I felt compelled to address our collective neglect of children and the trauma that results from child abuse and neglect. Even with the great work done by organizations like @Darkness2Light and ChildHelp, prevention is not a priority. This IS an epidemic. 
You will probably be tempted to turn away at the mere mention of child abuse; however, please read. Link in profile.

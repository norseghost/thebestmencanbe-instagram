.... #REPOST #RESHARE ... Hey Fam & Friends, Would love if you could show your support and follow @ik.sahara ... In 10 years of working with Victims and Survivors of Sexual Violence and Domestic Assault; I have had people reach out to me many times (outside of work)... Whether itâ€™s because they have been directly impacted by violence or they have a family or friend who has.. IK SAHARA will be a space that will allow others to share their stories (Identities will remain confidential) along with having a place where we can engage with one another, Share resources and supports.. All it takes is Ik Sahara to find the strength within ourselves to overcome even the most challenging moments in our lives.. #IkSahara #awareness #support #domesticviolence #sexualassault #notmysecret

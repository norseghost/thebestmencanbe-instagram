Life is like a wave, things come and go but don’t forget they’re apart of a bigger picture. 
I’m currently reading “ The Deepest Well “ by Dr. Nadine Burke Harris, by suggestion of my husband of course lol, he’s like the librarian of books that mean something 😂💁🏽‍♀️ This book is about the health effects of Childhood adversity! Issa Read! 📝🔥

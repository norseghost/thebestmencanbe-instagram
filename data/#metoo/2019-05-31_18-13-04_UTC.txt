I know I usually make for survivors, but I today I wanted to make a post for those of you who are trying to help someone you care for that is a survivor. Helping someone who has been sexually assaulted can be hard. Sometimes it's difficult to know what to do, so here are just a few ways to help:
• Be present. Sometimes we just need someone to be near.
• Be there without judgement. Be aware of what you say and what could possibly come off as judgement. Victims/survivors may be extremely sensitive, and may just need gentleness.
• Listen. Many times we feel like people just aren't listening to what we say.
• Believe them. There is a whole world out there waiting to tell them that they are making this up. It's important for them to know that someone believes them.
• Don't Force them to talk before they're ready, but be ready to listen as soon as they're able to talk.
• Encourage and help make small tasks easier. It is very common for victims/survivors to become depressed, have anxiety, PTSD, or turn to drugs. Understand that small daily tasks may be difficult.

There are so many more ways to help. If you are a survivor, feel free to share what has helped you in the comments! If you are someone who cares for a survivor, share some ways you have helped them!

Just woke up praising God this morning. Been through so much. Still going through thangs too, but Iâ€™m in my right mind. I have a roof...a nice roof... over my head, got food in my belly and in my cabinets. I have joy in my heart and realness in my worship. Iâ€™m alright. How you doin? #lgbtqðŸŒˆ #inclusion #godisgood #liveoutloud #beyourself #metoo #worship

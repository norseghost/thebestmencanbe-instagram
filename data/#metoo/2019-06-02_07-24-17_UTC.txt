Great conversation & company. We were chatting about this book and the Australian #metoo movement (warts ‘n all!) I contributed an essay to this anthology & @miriamsved is one of the amazing editors.

Our chat was hosted by the brainy and beautiful @emmamacdonaldinsta 
Thanks for having us @musecanberra! We’ll be back soon to drink wine 🍷

Yumi Ishikawa, actress and writer, recently launched a campaign, '#KuToo' (KuToo references #MeToo, but is also a wordplay on Kutsu靴 (the Japanese word for shoes) and Kutsuu 苦痛(the Japanese word for pain) to protest against women being forced to wear high heels at workplaces in order to be 'professional'. At its core, the campaign has a petition to Japan's labour ministry: the #KuToo movement has received widespread attention in Japan and people who've signed the petition demand a law that bans high heels from being a mandatory part of workplace attire. The labour minister (swipe to read), however, said that high heels are "occupationally necessary and appropriate". Workplaces in Japan aren't exactly women-friendly (or friendly in general, but I'd like to save that for another discussion). Japan ranked 110 out of 149 countries in the Global Gender Gap Report issued by the World Economic Forum (for perspective, we all know how India is doing in terms of gender and equality, and India still ranks 108.) Workplaces barely ever focus on modifications that could be made to make themselves more accessible and open; the focus is instead is on how women must be modified so they can be seen not just being equal to men, but AS men in workplaces.  The high heels add to one's height: you're expected to look tall so you can match up to your male counterparts and be taken seriously enough. Well, time to kick aways the bullshit, I'm guessing? So proud to see this happening and making the waves that it is.

It’s 2018, and 40,000 girls become child brides every day in all corners of the world from Sudan to the USA. _ For those unfamiliar, Noura Hussein was found guilty of killing her husband after he repeatedly raped her. She was subsequently sentenced to death by hanging. However, her legal team appealed and her charge was reduced to manslaughter with an $18k penalty.  _ While this was a victory, we are fighting for her charges to be reduced to self defense, the fine to be eliminated, and for her to be safe and free to pursue her dream of attending law school. _ Your support for Noura is a step towards supporting girls worldwide.  _ #JusticeForNoura • GoFundMe #linkinbio via @jidenna • Full video @cnn #nimaelbagir

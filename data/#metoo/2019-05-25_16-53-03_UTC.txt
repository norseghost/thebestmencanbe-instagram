Holiday weekends are prime opportunities for predators, both adults and youth, to molest. Watch the kids at your family gatherings. Don't let them wander off and be out of sight for extended periods of time. Don't allow kids to play unsupervised because kids molest other kids. If there is alcohol being served, watch your young people and make sure they aren't sneaking off with drinks. We aren't trying to scare you, we simply want you to understand that molestation can only occur when the abuser has access and opportunity. #childsexabuseawareness #stopchildsexabuse #childsexabusesurvivor #parentsofchilldsexabusesurvivor #sexualassault #endchildsexabuse #endrapeculture #childabuse #sextrafficking #atlanta #ATL #Georgia #church #girls #teens #awareness #rapevictim #victim #children #prevention #trafficking  #survivor #tips #blogger #speaker #metoo #advocate #volunteer  #socialmedia

If you're struggling with suicidal thoughts, self harm, or anything else, please know you're not alone. Reach out and call for help. It's hard right now, but it won't always be right now. It won't last. I know that doesn't make it better, so just know I see you and I feel you. I'm in the dark and brokenness too, and you are not alone. .

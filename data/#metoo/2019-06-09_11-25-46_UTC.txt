I recently put up a poll on my blog asking if you were a feminist. After almost 100 responses, about 94% replied in the affirmative. While I was delighted with the majority, the minority got me curious. Why would anyone think women should not have equal rights as men? So I personally texted all of them. None of them felt women shouldn't be granted equal rights as men. But none of them wanted to be called a feminist either. Ironic, right? Well, not really. 
We have reached a point where no government in India can ignore feminist voices. That's great. Feminism has over the years grown (or rather shrunk) from being a pro-equality movement to an anti-men movement. We have reached a point where no government in India can ignore feminist voices. That's great. But when they result in policies which aren't essentially gender neutral, it creates new problems. 
The anti-men rhetoric is not only killing the traditional support base for the movement but is also creating opposing movements like the #MenToo in India. You cannot take the men's rights movements for granted anymore because their concerns are legitimate. The 'meninists' have in fact taken over from the classical feminists are today's voice for equality and that shift is quite deplorable.

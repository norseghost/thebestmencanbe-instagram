Found out today that an abusive/toxic family member with a history of drug abuse cycles is trying to get a job at the same hospital I'm working at. So tomorrow I have to explain to my previous manager as unbiasly and logically as possible why my childhood molester isn't a good new hire choice...
I was just lamenting last session to my therapist that the hardest part about recovering from my traumas is that shit always seems to happen to rip those healing wounds wide open again.

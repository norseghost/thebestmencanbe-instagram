This year, SEXPOSED is a juried exhibition, with CASH PRIZES for our 1st/2nd/3rd place pieces! One exhibiting artist will win a Solo Show! 
So start working on new pieces focused on sexuality, sensuality, fetish-freedom, empowerment, body positivity, and consent! ———————————————
Interested in being a vendor. Applications will open in May as well! We are keeping the focus on art, so there will be a SUPER limited amount of spots available.

As always, SEXPOSED is a fundraiser, and this year, we’ll be benefitting the amazing nonprofit @rainn www.rainn.org———————————————

also i love Halsey so much. i’m gunna share her speech soon that she made at a Women’s March back in 2018. it had me in tears but it’s so empowering and enchanting, it’s my favourite i’ve ever heard. Halsey is a true inspiration to me, and i can imagine she is to many other young women like myself.
@iamhalsey we love you, we appreciate you, we thank you. 💘

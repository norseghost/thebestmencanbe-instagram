I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floatin' around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both.

1 year ago today I went on a 2 month solo adventure half way around the world. I was lost, my inspiration behind my career and life had just committed suicide, I was a full fledged man hater after so many #metoo experiences, I was heartbroken, I was losing my closest friend, and was battling an eating disorder I so desperately wanted to end. I was doubting my choices in life and I felt out of control, something needed to change and I knew I was ready for it. I was searching for answers and found some that I knew all along and other answers I did not see coming. I went all Eat, Pray, Love and was searching for happiness because I realized I don’t know if I ever truly knew the meaning. I can honestly say to this day, I am the happiest I’ve ever been. This is without comparing my life to anyone else’s and listening to others definition of success and not seeing it as a threat to my own. And knowing this now is a gift and a true sense of freedom. I believe choosing to be happy is not an easy choice but a rewarding one. Understanding what makes YOU happy is a journey in its own, and the best thing you can do for yourself. I spent weeks alone in some places, made new friends along the way too. I visited friends that I have met in the different stages of my life and got to see how they have grown and thrived once we went our separate directions. Everyone has their own version of happiness and I am so glad I was able to find mine within myself. I am so grateful for every single person I have met in my life and for every experience I have had, the good & the bad. With out the rain you couldn’t have a rainbow 🌈🙏 .
And the video is the day I left, a sign everything will be alright with a rainbow.

I started working at a safe house for survivors. These girls are between the ages of 12-17. The stories they have shared, the way their lives got shaped due to what they have experienced is heart breaking. These girls need people who not only know what human trafficking looks like but people who have a passion to see them for more than their past! Whether you get informed, get involved, or share your own story you can start shifting this ever-present issue! We are all human, we all have a voice, we are here to make a difference. #youareenough #enditmovement‚ùå #SHIFT #moderndayslavery #metoo #bethelight #christian #fight #yourvoicehaspower #befree #movement #change #wemakechange #sextraffickingawareness

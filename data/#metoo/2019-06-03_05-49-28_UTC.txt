But what if they’re here to teach us something? What if they are really messengers that will help us transform? In over two decades of practice, I’ve come to see negative emotions as teaching emotions. All they want is the same thing that you do; to be seen, heard, understood, and loved. You hold them in your body in the places where you have symptoms or disease. You can set them free.

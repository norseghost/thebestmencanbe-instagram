We have the tendency to complicate our life immeasurably. The consequence of this complication is that it keeps us stuck. We shoot ourselves in the foot so to speak! Complexity leads to an overwhelmed state of mind, and an overwhelmed mind canâ€™t see things clearly.
If you are one of those who overcomplicates his life, try to go back to basics and see how this will change your life for the better.
In the simplicity, there is this enormous clarity. This principal applies to both businesses and individual lives.
One of the main reasons that we complicate our life is, that it helps us to feel important. It is our ego that likes to complicate and confuse things. Our heart is not interested in creating obstacles!

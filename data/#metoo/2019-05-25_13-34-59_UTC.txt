In Finland is now going a campaign called  #minämyössynnyttäjänä. It brings up experiences of obstetric violence in Finland. Being pregnant and giving birth are so fragile and unique that everyone deserves to be treated extra gentle and beautifully during those moments. I wish this campaign makes birthprofessionals to think their own behaviour and that they can see the situations from the customers side too.

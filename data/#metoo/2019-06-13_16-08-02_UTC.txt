BELIEVE THEM. It’s taken me so long to be able to open up and talk about my most vulnerable experiences and my trauma. Years of doubt and saying, maybe it wasn’t that bad. Maybe it’s all in my head. I’ve had countless friends tell me my trauma was made up. An ex of mine told me I was probably asking for it and I over exaggerate things. My mom didn’t believe me. My own mother still doesn’t believe me. I once told one of my best friends about being raped when I was completely sober and they said “that doesn’t sound like him”. Someone once said, but you weren’t like tied up and kidnapped raped, so it wasn’t really “rape rape”. I was at work and i heard someone making fun of the #metoomovement And I was filled with fucking rage. It’s not fair. You don’t get to doubt someone’s fucking trauma or experiences. YOU don’t know what the FUCK THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH. It was like I was screaming into an empty cave. And I was alone. 
I’m finally in a relationship and friend group where I can be vulnerable. I can open up and share my trauma. I’m finally heard. 
So if someone opens up to you, fucking believe them. #metoo

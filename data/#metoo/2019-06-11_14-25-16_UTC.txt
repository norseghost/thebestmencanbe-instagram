CONSENT

People don't step to me anymore.  Part age. Part position. Part BigE.  But  in my work for @bloom365 I see a lot of young girls and boys (middle school where the madness of the hormonal tsunami starts) who aren't clear about both their rights and their limits. To keep #MeToo from being a never ending issue you have to teach the young ones what is and is not #cool. 
My shirt says #consent but I couldn't figure out how to get it in the shot. Which is a good thing because I noticed afterwards I had watermelon stains on it. ðŸ˜‚

The message however is still valid despite the shortcomings of my presentation.

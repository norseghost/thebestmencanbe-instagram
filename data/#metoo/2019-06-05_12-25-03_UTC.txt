Y’all. I’m a fan of @unlandedgentry. I. Am. A. Fan. I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy of Last Woman Standing several months back and just got around to reading it and I’m 100% here for it. It started a little slow, and took me a while to get into it, but when it picks up it really picks up. Suddenly, and all at once. This book has a lot of triggers, so please do your research before reading!! The whole book could honestly be a trigger for someone. Dana Diaz is a small time comedian, waiting for her big break. After a stand up show in her town, she meets Amanda. A gorgeous blonde with an insatiable taste for revenge. The women begin talking over drinks and find out they’ve both suffered some sort of injustice at the hands of powerful (and not so powerful) men. A joke over drinks about getting back at the men suddenly turns into a deadly revenge game that Dana can’t seem to find a way out of. This book couldn’t have been released at a more perfect time. With the #metoo movement and everything else going on in the real world, Amy Gentry hit the ball out of the park with this one. Did I always love the main character? No. Was I rooting her her the entire time? Abso-freaking-lutely. This book is on shelves now! Go pick up your own copy and quench your thirst for revenge!

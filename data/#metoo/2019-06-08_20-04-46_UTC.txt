We all need to heal our traumas!

After I took this picture I met an older Man. I often meet him when I have a walk in the forest. He was always kind. Today something was different. He was drunken and he was to close me and didn't respect any boundary. It was an encroachment. He touched me and that's wasn't okay in any way. But I was freezed for this moment, unable to react and ask for help. I needed helped and asked the universe to send me help. A few moments later a woman came the way and I was safe again. She didn't watched this situation but she safed me...
I'm okay now and I know this was a chance to heal and old trauma where there was no help.
I know the thoughts: No one ever would believe me. He is always so kind to everyone. He would never do this and no one would believe your story!

So please dear Women find the courage to open up. To take back your own strength and power. No one is allowed to touch you or more in any way! I know this feeling and we are able to heal and to release! ❤❤❤ #metoo #metoomovement #empoweringwomen #empowered #empoweredwoman #courage #strength #conscious #change #strongwoman #healing #release #light

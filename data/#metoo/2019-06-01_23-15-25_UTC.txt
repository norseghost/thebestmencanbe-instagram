"I was raped. And my daughter is the result. I didn't report it because of news articles about the rapist getting partial custody. That terrified me. So I kept my mouth shut. And I would never want my daughter to know that's how she came about. All she needs to know is that she's loved beyond measure, just as much as her brothers." - C .

Off to sleep. Long day. Caught up on Chemistry homework.  Did a play audition and had a lot of fun doing the last reading and would have been nice to reset and finish my PCC theater experience on a positive note and work with a friend of mine.  My friend got his second title role and will be Dracula. I  doubt we will ever be able to work together again, which sucks. I know I will have my moment one day hopefully soon. I can't wait to feel wanted and appreciated again. Haven't had anyone reach out but I  get I am  not  anyone's priority.  Either way got to finish strong now it is all A&P for the next week and a half.

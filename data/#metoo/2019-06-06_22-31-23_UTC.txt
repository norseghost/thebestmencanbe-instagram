Coming from the initial topic of removing stigmas #KanyeWest compared the way people with mental-health issues are judged or disregarded to the general fear that was placed on men during the #MeToo era since in certain cases each group has been afraid to have open conversations about it, to which @Letterman replied, “I would submit that is’ not equal by any equation to the fear women feel being the other side of that.” He went on to add, “With future reinforcement and enlightenment, there may be a more reasonable expression of friendliness between the sexes that isn’t threatening to women…” In agreement, though still making his point, West stated, “Especially if you scared for your life to talk about it.” Which would you consider the bigger problem? Not understanding the full issue or not talking about it enough? #TheFutureOfMen

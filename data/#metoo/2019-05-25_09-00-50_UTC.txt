A few months ago I had the pleasure of being photographed by the talented @elizahatch for @cheerupluv 💕 Eliza photographs women who have experienced sexual harassment, in some cases assault, and offers them a platform where they can share their stories 👭
I have been pretty vocal lately on the topic of sexual harassment in the advertising industry, probably because I have seen others go through similar experiences as I have but not much has been done about it. I have heard men openly mock the #MeToo movement, I have also heard a CEO refer to a female employee as ‘the company bike that everyone wants to ride’. 🤯There are so many terrifying stories out there, not mine to tell, and so many industry widespread rumours.The scariest part is how normalised such behaviour and such actions are. 
For the mere three years I have spent in advertising, I have also encountered some wonderful people who have been my rock in tough times, so this post is for you too - thank you for all the support 😍

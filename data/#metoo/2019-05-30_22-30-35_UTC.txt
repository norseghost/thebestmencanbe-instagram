[Both from either @thepatrilinealjew ‘s story, or @ethnically_jewish ‘s stories]. Unfortunately, yes, it is true. Instagram is choosing to attempt to de-platform Jewish people speaking up about their own oppression and struggles, spreading positivity to the Jewish community, and/or providing a literally free source of unwhitewashed jewish history. They’ve now chosen to remove BAAS while continuing to ignore and leave up the accounts and their comments that did some of but not limited to the following:
•Literal Nazi’s
•Ganged up on my posts about MY OWN ASSAULT, stating that I’m lying, that I made it up, that if it was ~*really*~ real it would be on the local police website...oh, and Instagram? They did and have continued to do absolutely nothing about any of it.
•Out of around 500 (give or take ten) reports of hate speech on posts on accounts that literally are doing 90% of what the examples of hate speech not allowed on this platform are, less than 10 of them received anything but the equivalent of “oopsie daisy, you silly Jew, this swastika accompanied by the caption of, ‘Jews are lower, to me, than even a weed you pull out of the ground. They are not human and they should be placed in human zoo’s like the animals they are’ isn’t against our guidelines! Even though WE OPENLY STATE in our own guidelines that Nazi symbolism and white nationalist content is considered against the guidelines! Silly billy!”
•Actually, literally put my *extremely important* information on a known neo Nazi website local to the state I am in, then proceeded to tell them the city I live in as well, knowing and intending that doing so was putting me in real, serious danger from the abusers I am literally still hiding from.
•Regularly allows goyische leftists to spread antisemitic speech and propaganda, especially those things when left ON JEWISH ACCOUNTS. Then leaving those posts and comments up, while removing the posts, accounts and comments made by the Jewish people speaking up against all of that.
•They are seemingly targeting JOC mainly and at large, though they’re absolutely still silencing *all* Jewish accounts that do anything even remotely wrong.

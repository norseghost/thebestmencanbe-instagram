When you start to let your light shine it causes others to make theirs shine brighter.
I was not put on this earth to suffer, and neither were you.
If you’re unhappy then girl you’re in the driver seat. 
It’s time you STOP pretending you’re fine.
Stop telling yourself “I’m good.”
Stop smiling when it hurts.
Give up the act, and start living your life as you, and for you!
You don’t have to do this alone,
we’re all just running around trying not to catch on fire. 🔥🙈

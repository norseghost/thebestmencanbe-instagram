People always tell me about the power of silence and solitude as a way to reconnect with the voice that lives inside of us.  Sitting in silence to me sounds like soul death 💀. I’m the kinda dude that needs to keep it pushin’. Getting me to relax and reflect is something that just never seems to work for me.  But in the spirit of trying to grow and do new things, I tried.  Here’s what I found:
.
.
I’m bad at it.  I’m really attached to my phone...like really.  I worry a lot.  I reflect on past failures...a lot.  I talk myself out of doing things even before I begin them.  I feel guilty for feeling that way.  And then I feel shame about feeling guilty.  I can’t sit down without thinking about creating a new song or story.  I’m really bad at this.
.
.
Felt pretty bad about failing at that and didn’t really connect with that so-called voice inside of me...unless that voice is really awful and preoccupied with the thoughts I mentioned above.  To be real...if it is, that’s not really someone or something I really need in my life.  I know me.  I need positivity and encouragement in my life right now, not worry or shame or guilt.  And maybe that’s the point.  Maybe I need to spend more time with myself, listening to the internal narrative I’m creating subconsciously.  Cuz before I can change the story of my life, I gotta change the story I’m telling myself. 🌱⭐️💜 #changingnarratives .

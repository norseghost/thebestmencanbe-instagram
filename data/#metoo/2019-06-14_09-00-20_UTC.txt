We exemplify habits and behaviours to our children through our own life. When it comes to boys it seems to be a "normal" behavior when their behavior is wild or rude and they show their untamed aggression. In fact our society teaches boys that there is no reason to cry at all. 
Showing strength is a kind of attitude to follow. Well, this might be helpful in some particular situations but it is'nt helpful in a whole lifetime at all. Sometimes this behavior we call toxic masculinity. 
Sadly a society grows up were it´s still a big challenge for boys to ask and seek for help when they are exposed to (sexualized) violence.

On our website you can find helpful resources to support a culture of care for boys* and young men who face sexualized violence. (link in bio)

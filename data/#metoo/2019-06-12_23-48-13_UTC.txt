Hey loves. 
Today was rough. Normally I push myself even lower because “I’m not supposed to have bad days.” With everyone constantly posting the happiest best of times, I think we start to think that having a rough day is unacceptable. We try to “fix” the problems in every single way we could possibly think of. But sometimes it’s ok to just accept that it’s a hard day. 
ITS OK TO HAVE A BAD DAY! Or two, or maybe three!
Repeat to yourself “this is how I’m feeling and this is ok.” Your feelings and thoughts are valid and they matter. Don’t try to stifle them. If you need to cry, do it! If you need to do absolutely nothing for a day, do it! If you need to go workout twice to burn some extra stress, do it!!!! But also remind yourself that so far, you have survived every single one of your bad days. 
They happen. 
We’re human. 
Let yourself be vulnerable to your feelings. 
Learn. 
Grow. 
Have your bad day or week, but don’t let it win forever. 
Find your smile again and rise stronger.

“ In  Hebrew, Ahava = Love and L’Chaim = To Life are the basics of the great Jewish Civilizations Worldwide. The two words have nothing to do with the Apartheid State of Israel. Do not mix up these words  of Peaceful Judaism with and/or get confused by the practice of Apartheid in the Historical Palestine, as Love, Life and Peaceful Judaism are highjacked today by the inhumane and criminal practice of the Israeli  Apartheid and its most cruel army of ethnic cleansers in Palestine. Always keep in mind that the Peaceful Judaism has absolutely nothing to do with the Israeli Apartheid. Make your own research to find out why. Think🤔🌿🌹Love💋, Live🌸and let Live🤗🌺.”R.F.

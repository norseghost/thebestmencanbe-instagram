A story showing we do not live in a society that welcomes the idea of saying no...
“He was free spirited and kind but not my type. Most evenings my friend and I would get drunk with him and his friends. They continuously lied about their ages but we thought it was funny. I don’t really remember how it happened but I ended up kissing him. The first night was fun so we went back the next night. I liked him enough I thought. One night he took me to the beach and I went down on him. I hated it and wanted to stop but he said I couldn’t, how could I leave him without satisfying him? So I continued. I haven’t been able to that again, for anyone, for over a year until I found someone who didn’t pressure me. We went back the next night, drinking for free, eating for free and having a great time. But every night I would end up feeling like I had to ‘satisfy‘ him otherwise our friendship and the fun would end. I didn’t want to but didn’t know how to say no. One night I don’t even remember anything but waking up a couple hours later knowing we had had sex. He was 32 and I was 18, although I never said no I felt pressured and violated because I never had the opportunity to say no. I don’t think I was raped but I realised I don’t live in a society where I feel like it is always ok to no.” #ournakedtruth #speakout #metoo #universitysexualassault #prochoice #sexualassault #brave

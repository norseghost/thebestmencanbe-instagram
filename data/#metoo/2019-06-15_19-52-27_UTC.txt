The Original #Metoo Movement. This was a stage scene design from 1966 called "The Mother of Us All" (Act lll, scene 2). Women once had to rebel to vote. They won nationally in 1920. They began fighting for it in 1840, eighty years earlier. William M. Marston, the man who created Wonder Woman was inspired by women chaining themselves together in these protests while he was in college.

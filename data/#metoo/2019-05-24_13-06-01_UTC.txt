#Reparations involves making a heartfelt financial apology for violence. Often it doesn’t feel good, though it is still heartfelt, to sexual #predators. 
This $44 million dollar financial settlement isn’t necessarily reparations. It is a court-based decision. It was negotiated by lawyers in the courts. Witnesses provided testimony, so did victims and the sexual predator himself. I’ll say his name, and it’s #HarveyWeinstein.

Not one penny of this tentative settlement ensures that #HealingJustice was had by the women who were raped, abused, and entrapped by #WeinsteinTheSexualPredator. 
Reparations needs to feel just, #honest, and restorative to the people most harmed by violence. Victims become #survivors as they lead their #healing, not lawyers. 
Survivors are people who have found their voices. A settlement *is* reparations when survivors gain cash that helps them move forward from a place of personal and financial strength. I pray these women and each witness to their abuse feel safer, stronger, saner, and deeply settled now. 
Harvey Weinstein remains a sexual predator. He isn’t absolved. He’s just less financially rich and more known for his abuse.

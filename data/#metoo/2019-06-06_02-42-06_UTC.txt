Looks can be deceiving folks. I can make myself look like everything’s fine, inside it’s a fucking disaster. When you ask someone how they are, actually fucking listen when they tell you the truth. People are so quick to turn a blind eye once someone tries sharing that they aren’t fine. Nobody wants to hear it, and that shits gotta stop. No wonder people keep it bottled up and snap. Don’t ask if you don’t want to hear what someone has to say. For anyone who needs someone to talk to, even if it’s just to vent, feel validated, I am here. I will do my best to help. I genuinely care, how are you? ——————————————————#mentalhealthisjustasimportantasphysicalhealth #mentalhealthadvocate #mentalillness #invisibleillness #ptsd #depression #majordepressivedisorder #bpd #bpdawareness #substanceabuse #recovery #metoo #letyourvoicebeheard #speakup #suicideawarness #suicideprevention #imhereforyou#fightingtolivenotsurvive

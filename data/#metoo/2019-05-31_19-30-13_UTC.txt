Yes, all new counts are related to my case. Yes, I know his fans are mad about it. Please, DO NOT contact me telling me how I'm wrong for pursuing criminal charges all of these years later. Blah! No matter how 'wrong' you think I am, the law is on my side, a MINOR at the time. Carry on." /// What do you think?-⠀

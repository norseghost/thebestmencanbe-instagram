Important note: don’t let your doctors rip you off of the Maximum Recommended Human Dose of a benzodiazepine in less than four days like the hospital did me. Not only is it inhumane, but it is VERY dangerous and can lead to grand mal seizures and worse. Please speak to your doctor about doing a humane and most importantly SAFE taper if you are going to come off of a benzodiazepine. 💙

As you may know, Pantone announced “Ultra-Violet” as the official color of the year 2018. So yes, the trend is over BUT how many of you know that the meaning of this bright color goes way beyond fashion and has been used as a hue to represent political symbolism throughout human history?⠀
⠀
Today, swiss labour rights groups are calling on all participants of the national women’s strike to “color Bern violet”. So dear women in Switzerland, leave your workplaces this afternoon and make yourself visible with violet clothes or by carrying violet flags regardless of the city you decide to make noise in for your rights. ⠀
⠀
There is a long list of reasons why to take part in today's strike. These range from unequal wages to pressures on part-time employees, the burden of household work, and sexual violence. ⠀
⠀
The date of the strike, June 14, is of particular significance in the fight for gender equality in Switzerland. On that date in 1981, Swiss citizens voted to manifest gender equality into the constitution. Then on June 14, 1991, 500'000 women, led by unions, stopped working in Switzerland in protest at the lack of progress on equality. ⠀
⠀
And now today, another basically 30 years later, are you participating? And if so, what is your main motivation to join the women's strike demonstration? ⠀

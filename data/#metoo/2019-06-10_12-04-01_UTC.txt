Thank God for great friends that support this movement. Sometimes you have to just repeat God’s words so they will marinate in your heart. Rest on God’s promises everyday. He keeps all His promises. He promised us we are not made to be in bondage or suffer abuse. He is our protector but we must rest in His arms. Take His hand. Don’t look back. Speak up, get away, and stay away. Inbox me for details about the shirt. All proceeds go to help domestic violence victims escape. #noweapon #lovegod #trustgod #speakup #getaway #stayaway #loveyourkids #loveyourself #domesticviolence #domesticviolencesurvivor #somesticviolenceawareness #metoo

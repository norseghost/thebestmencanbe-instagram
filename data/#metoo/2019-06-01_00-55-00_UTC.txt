Toxic masculinity victimizes both men and women, according to Goldtooth. “Toxic masculinity is defined by men’s inability to process anger, rage and fear. In this worldview, the only response is dysfunction and self-destruction,” he said.

Goldtooth says mainstream society doesn’t challenge men to ask themselves to whom they are accountable or to be aware of how they are contributing to the suffering and inconvenience to others. “It’s time for us to step up and hold ourselves accountable and help heal our communities; men who are known to harass women should be asked to leave ceremonies. They are not welcome because their presence doesn’t create a space of safety or healing,” he said.

Historically, harassment and violence towards women were not part of traditional Native cultures, according to Lindsay Compton, executive director of the White Buffalo Calf Woman Society.

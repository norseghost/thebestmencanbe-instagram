I'm starting out this week by sharing great news I will be showing this piece at @artless.bastard  in De Pere in a juried show titled REJECTED. This is a detail shot of the actual woodcut that I spent nearly a month cutting. "Triumvirate " was created during the time #metoo was gaining momentum last year and has been rejected by several shows/ opportunities. This felt like a push back about the change/ unity among women that it represents. Inclusion of this piece in the REJECTED show marks a complicated turning point in how society views and treats women.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
I'm excited to see what a show exclusively about rejection looks like. We all have these preconceived notions of what rejection looks like but  I know seeing a collection of work that has been rejected will be an empowering sight.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
If you're near De Pere on June 20 join us at the opening from 6-9pm and celebrate grit and perseverance in the face of rejection. Of course you're welcome to toast from afar or visit while the show is up. Cheers! â €â €â €
â €â €â €â €â €â €
Also a note on rejection if you're feeling it know that wherever you are in dealing with rejection, you are so much more than the work you create, the things you do and if you haven't heard this lately you are enough!!! Don't give up, don't decide to exclude yourself from opportunities because you think you won't succeed, do it anyway because that's how you'll learn, how you'll grow and how you'll change the damn world. ðŸ’ª

Some people protect, speak for, stay connected with those who have abused us, have hurt others and continue to do so. .
They are no better than the abuser.
.
Standing by an abuser is one of the most hurtful things a friend or other can do. It not only shows that you support domestic abuse but will continue to allow it to happen and showing everyone just how weak you really are.
.
If a friend has shared a story about their domestic violence regarding a mutual friend, why would you remain friends with the abuser? Simply because it didn't happen to you? That is socially irresponsible and makes you a bad friend. .
I have several friends who have been victim to domestic abuse by the same person and somehow he is still protected by those who haven't and have been a victim to his abusive behavior. .
We can no longer stand by. I'm not, I've made my choice and now it's time for you to make yours and stop letting you persecuter defeat you. .
Some will allow themselves to be manipulated by the perpetrator, after the abuse, as a way of surviving the abuse, as a coping mechanism thinking they conquered the pain.
.
Remove these toxic and abusive people from our circles. Support each other's personal abuse story. Human empowerment is all we need to survive.
.
Speak up for your friends, they are suffering from your silence.
.
Do not support abusive behavior or companies that do. .
This is for the Bollas of the world, the Michelle's, the Mary's, your neighbors, your communities.

I WANT TO HAVE A CHAT ABOUT CHIVALRY... It certainly is NOT dead. 
Chivalry is, and always will be one of the most beautiful qualities a man can own. 
The code of chivalry emphasizes mastery, generosity and courtesy in all areas of life, and if met and received well by others, (particularly women) it would continue to be a moral code adhered by all... My three sons are masters of chivalry, because I teach them daily, what it takes to be a true gentleman. 
All born in Generation Z, they are proof that chivalry is not dead; because in my home, we practice respect, courtesy and empowerment, and we nurture this together. 
I am not old fashioned, or antiquated, but simply supporting and embracing masculine qualities and developing morals rather than emasculating. 
My goal is to ensure I develop and deliver three beautiful gentlemen to the world... Feminine empowerment is on the rise but so is the masculine movement... We need to embrace this with every reinforcement we can offer. 
As human beings, this is our purpose.

And Iâ€™m just a lady over here, who is equally prepared to honor man and match him where he is at, in all my feminine glory. 
No expectations, just like for like... And how do we create such wholesome gentlemen?; ðŸ§¡ Open a car door for a woman ðŸ§¡ Help a woman lift the heavy things ðŸ§¡ Pass the tissues in times of tears
ðŸ§¡ Pay for a date when asking a girl out ðŸ§¡ Stopping to help victims of bullies
ðŸ§¡ Driving a car when your friends can not
ðŸ§¡ Adore your partner for everything she stands for
ðŸ§¡ Enrich your connection by honoring and respecting ðŸ§¡ Choose spontaneity rather than comfort ðŸ§¡ Love with all your heart and never hold back ðŸ§¡ Support your partner in all her ventures
ðŸ§¡ Hanging picture frames (yep hang the damn picture frames ðŸ™„) You see what we can collectively penetrate through and ultimately create here? ðŸ‘‰ Gentlemen with solid confident and respectful intentions ...AND...
ðŸ‘‰ Ladies with  solid confident and equally matched respectful intentions

Itâ€™s not about just supporting  #metoo itâ€™s about empowerment and endless love of creating #wetoo

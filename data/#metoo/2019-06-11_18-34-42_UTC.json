She has been an avid blogger, blogging about her life and the challenges of marriage since 2011, motherhood since 2012, and the recovery process she went through after being diagnosed with PTSD in 2013.\n\nWhen she's not writing, or spending time with her family she is a dedicated volunteer for A Voice for the Innocent. AVFTI is a wonderful organization dedicated to helping survivors of sexually based crimes share their stories and find local resources to offer a community of support. \nFor more information or to share your story please visit: http://www.avoicefortheinnocent.org \nBY REBECCA MACCEILE \nCandy Apple Butterscotch: A Memoir\nNovelties: A Collection of Unfinished Short Stories\nTurquoise Boot Straps: A Survivor's Thoughts\n\nYou can find the most up to date information about Rebecca and her upcoming projects at: http://www.rebeccasbookshop.com \nPRAISE FOR CANDY APPLE BUTTERSCOTCH\n\"This is one of those books that really hits home if you've had a terrible relationship. Not like a bad breakup over something stupid...but the kind where you're totally convinced that this horrible person is your soul mate.\" \"The accounts of the trauma are laid out in such a way that you know what's happening and are able to imagine it but you aren't bombarded with intense graphic imagery, which I appreciate as a survivor myself. Would definitely recommend!\" \"This amazingly written gem takes you inside the author's world and keeps you there, making you feel like a discreet \"bug on the wall.\" I could not put it down.\" #writingcommunity #authorsofinstagram #independentpublisher #metoo #ptsdsurvivor #memoir #nonfiction"

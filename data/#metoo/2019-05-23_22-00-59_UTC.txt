End the stigma and judgement around Mental illness, Stop saying to people with mental illness to "just think positive" 
Sadly It's not as easy as "just thinking positive" and if it were there would not be as many people out there struggling. 
Its an ongoing battle that can take years of retraining the brain and whole thought process of unhealthy copeing mechanisms you have taught yourself to cope in life.

It's not something that you can easily reach out to people and ask for help because it's something you dont fully understand yourself or know how to even begin to explain or know what would even help you. 
You fight with your thoughts of not wanting to ask for help or let anyone in because you feel this will add to your anxiety, of feeling judged,labelled attention seeking, you dont know who's genuine or who to trust, people want you to explain how your feeling, you dont want to be a burden, you don't want to be seen as weak.

It becomes easier to isolate, withdrawal from everyone to cope, but then that comes with its anxietys as well, your friends and family are upset because you never visit them or message back, you come across as like you are being a snob or what ever else you a labelled as, you shut people out because its easier to do that then be hurt anymore.

Mental illness is not easy, knowing who to trust is not easy especially when you were abused by people in life who you should have been able to trust, who you should have felt safe.. how do you ever trust again after that?  It's not easy at all.

Mental illness is physically and mentally draining, your body constantly in fight and flight mode screening everyone who could be a potential threat to you. 
Just Be kind to people and quit the judgement everyone is fighting a battle that from an outsider's point of view may not seem much but is life crippling for them and judgement and stigma does not help.

Today I was reflecting on Woman. 
Myself, woman who have influenced my life, young ladies coming up before me. 
And I imagine most of you feel the same as me most days. 
Like you're carrying the world on your shoulders. Families to take care of, grieving loved ones, working, and all while most times trying to look after yourself and find your self at the same time too. 
That's the just of it! 
I see woman fighting for our rights, ours ancestral routes on the oceans, womans equality rights, Missing & Murdered Indigenous Woman, rape survivors. 
This is an Original I started today, one more coat to go on & a few touch ups and she will be my 2nd to date piece! 
One of a kind she will be. I am still thinking of a title.

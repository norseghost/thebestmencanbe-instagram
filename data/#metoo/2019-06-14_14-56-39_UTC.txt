Why don’t you just tell him to fuck off? Why do you say you hate men after one said something creepy? Because of stories like this. These men are always bigger then me, older, and stronger. If I say something back I may provoke him. If I ignore him that could piss him off too. Don’t look afraid, don’t look approachable. Leave your phone in your pocket, keep your music low, look up don’t watch the ground, stay aware of your surroundings. I don’t tell myself this for shits and giggles. When woman are out doing their thing: DON’T FUCKING YELL THINGS AT THEM. I don’t care if you think it’s a compliment, it’s still terrifying. Don’t tell me to smile, don’t make comments about my body, don’t say what you want to do to me. Even if it’s not vulgar or what you think is threatening, it isn’t cool. Leave us the fuck alone. This is an every time I leave my home alone thing. Harassment isn’t rare and something that only happens on TV and it sure as hell isn’t a complement.

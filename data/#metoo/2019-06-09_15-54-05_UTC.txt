The mountain you have been assigned was a divine designation, customized by a powerful being.

Your challenges have been specifically channelled for you and YOU only.

They mirror the challenges faced by others to show you what's possible but they need your unique twist to be converted from "difficulty" into "opportunity." Your willingness to embrace these challenges IS your exact mission.

Question: Can you embrace the challenges you face AND convert each one of them from a difficulty into an opportunity. 
Because once you overcome the challenges and climb the mountain... The goal is for YOU to show others exactly how it's done.

Through this new wave of feminism the concern that feminism is just women hating on men has been widely spread. People mistake feminism, which is the advocacy of women’s rights on the basis of the equality of sex’s, for misandry, which is the dislike or ingrained prejudice against men. 
In the article, Misadry: the invisible hatred of men, it talks about mircroaggressions. These are subtle (or not so subtle) things we do to distance ourselves from minorities. Females often focus on the mircroagressions towards them, including: “I wouldn’t work for a woman”, “if you dress like a slut your asking for it”, “I’m impressed that a women can do that” , etc. Most women have been in a situation similar to the ones about, and these microagressions have been something we have focused on in feminism. However, we, as females, don’t often look at it from the other side. Comments like “men only think with their dicks”, “men just want a hole to put it in”, “be a man”, “really? You don’t like sports” are microagressions that men are associated with. 
Whether we are conscious of these comments and perceptions we are making or not, they are present to some degree. 
This is where the conversation comes in about women just hating men through the use of feminism. Women rally around one another when faced with the comments men make towards them, but dismiss the condescending and prejudice ideas in their own mind.

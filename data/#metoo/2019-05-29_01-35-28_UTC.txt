*Sound On.* During our time in Uganda, we worked with the pre-teen and teenage girls to break the gender and cultural stigmas facing them as females. During this time, the girls listed out all of the cultural barriers and taboos that stand in their way once they get their period. • They can no longer continue their education.
• They must get married. • They can’t play sports. • They cannot attend church.
• They are unclean... Once they listed out all of these barriers, we put them on a string and they physically ran through them, breaking the barriers down as they screamed, “I Am Beautiful. I Am Powerful.” Today as we celebrate menstrual hygiene day, we thank @surgeforwater for their work to break the barriers facing women and girls around the world.  We are humbled and honored to serve alongside them. Thank you to @thisislindsay who captured this experience so beautifully and to each and every photographer that gives their time and talents to bring awareness to the stories that need to be told around the world. 
If you would like to be a part of the work that @surgeforwater is doing, check out the link in our bio to give towards this program to help change the lives of women and girls around the world. If you are a photographer that has a heart to give back and use your talent to tell the stories of those that often go unheard, DM us, we’d be honored to have you on our team.

To every woman and girl here and abroad, may you hear the voices of these girls resounding among you and may you know this day and everyday, that you are beautiful and you are powerful.

Unexpected beauty in Agra ðŸ’› The Taj Mahal is often considered one of the most beautiful buildings ever created. However, I found something more beautiful right down the street at a cafe called @sheroes_hangout run by female acid attack survivors. â €
â €
While the women shared their personal stories about being attacked by rejected lovers or angry family members, I couldnâ€™t fathom the emotional and physical hurt they endured. Yet, all I saw in front of me were strong and beautiful women full of joy and confidence. I could see the hope and dignity they got from working at Sheroes, a place where theyâ€™re accepted exactly as they are. A place that gives them strength to advocate against their attackers and the sale of acid in India. â €
â €
If youâ€™re in Agra visiting the Taj Mahal, make sure to pop into @sheroes_hangout for a cup of tea or a meal. Much gratitude to the women who shared their stories and @gadventures @planeterracares for bringing us and always providing ways for travelers to support worthy local businesses. #nomadicfareinindia #gforgood â €

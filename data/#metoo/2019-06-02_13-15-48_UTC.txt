Women and girls all over the world have faced chauvinism, sexism, discrimination, assault and in worse case: death. "Not all men", yes. But it's enough of them, to damage everything. Dear men, learn and teach your gender to be good humans instead of trying to be defensive in front of females who have faced everything under the sun. It begins with you and yours.

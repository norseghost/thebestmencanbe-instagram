Just a reminder of why we're doing all this. Why our advocates put their bodies on the line. Why they spoke truth to power knowing it would result in arrest. It's because three brave women came forward to say that #DavidByrd sexually abused them when they were children. We will not stop until he is expelled from the legislature.

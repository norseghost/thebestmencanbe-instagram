I finished first round of edits. Will send to my editor in a few days. Iâ€™m exhausted, sick and probably have another sinus infection. But Iâ€™m so proud of this book and what itâ€™s becoming. I love my characters so much like they are my daughters. I just want them to find peace. I want to hug them and love them and never let them go so they always feel safe. They are so close to my heart right now. 
They are me. They are you. They are all the girls out there who have experienced sexual assault and are trying to come to terms with what happened to them. And to come out from under it all. I hope the girls who read it will feel inspired and unashamed to tell their stories because of these characters. I really do.ðŸ’• These characters are so brave. Braver than I ever was. .

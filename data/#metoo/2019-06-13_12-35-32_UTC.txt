I am still beaming with excitement after last nightâ€™s preliminary competition. .

I was able to prove myself as a world-class performer when I tapped my way through my performance after my tap mic came untaped from my body not even 10 seconds into my routine! Shout out to the audience for getting into my Devil Went Down To Georgia routine, making the experience something I will never forget. .

I also took the stage in evening gown, feeling confident and empowered, as I shared my social impact statement-highlighting my goal I want to achieve as Miss Illinois: Bring advocacy and activism to all of Illinois so we can eliminate sexual violence from our schools, work places, communities, and all social forums. It was a beautiful moment that moved me to tears. .

@arminvestigations has never, in 9 years of doing undercover investigations, seen such constant daily torture of newborns as they have documented at fair oaks farms supplying “fair life” milk and others. The video on their page is up for all to watch—  if you are still consuming cow and goat products, please watch what you are paying people to do when you purchase those products. It shows men smashing newborns in the face with milk bottles as they desperately try to find sustenance, men throwing, dragging, kicking and stomping on newborn calves all stolen from their moms minutes after she gave birth. This is why I’m #vegan4life. Not my Health. (Tho that’s obviously a boost.) Its always about them. The more we allow ppl to take the VICTIMS OUT OF THE EQUATION the more all of us lose. WE CANNOT HAVE “METOO” without TOTAL ANIMAL LIBERATION. We cannot teach fairness or reach victory without ALL OF US on board. We cannot normalize abuse of ANYONE while trying to preach fairness to others. That is MORAL SCHIZOPHRENIA that the dying system is hoping people stay with. (Hint: it’s not working). #gofuckingveganalready #dairy #cheese #babies #newborns #metoo #women #mothers #dairyisscary #dairyisrape #dairyiskidnapping

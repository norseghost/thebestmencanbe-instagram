🏝 VACATION BABY 🏝
.
Earlier this month, I took my first-ever week-long vacation. Tbh, I was an absolute stress case leading up to it because I kept panicking about falling behind in work or letting me team down — or just feeling lazy because I know I push myself to constantly feel productive. At the same time, I knew that taking a break was overdue, I was struggling (even more than usual) to wake up in the mornings bc I was just SO TIRED 😓
.
But, I DID IT! Spent a weekend in Las Vegas for EDC, and then a week in Cancun 💕🏝 When I got back, I felt so stressed about catching up...only to realize that it just took a few extra hours on email one night to feel back on track. The @periodmovement and @juv.consulting teams are so strong, independent, dependable, and bold on their own — and realizing that was not only very humbling, but also made me so proud of both teams, and I feel so excited to dream and do thing bigger this summer with our new interns/associates!!

Hoping to vacation again before I go back to Harvard this fall 🦋 any suggestions for affordable/beautiful places to travel?? ✈️

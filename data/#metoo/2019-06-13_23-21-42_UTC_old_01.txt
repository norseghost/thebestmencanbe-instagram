I support this message 1000 percent! It’s okay to go to therapy sis! Do whatever you need to balance those emotions so that you don’t pass toxic stuff to your seeds... I don’t know who needs to hear this but take yo ass to therapy sis!.... —————————————————-The thought of becoming a mom can send a woman into depression and/or anxiety.

So many thoughts run through our head, from not being good enough or ready to worrying about making the same mistakes our parents did to even just not feeling like your life is in order to bring another person into it.

.
1 in 7 women experience depression during pregnancy. These women are also more likely to experience postpartum depression. About 6% of women experience anxiety during pregnancy and 10% experience postpartum anxiety.
.
.
These number are low for a reason. Because 50% of women do NOT report their symptoms out of fear.
.
.
.
50%? So every 2 mothers I meet daily, 1 of them more than likely experienced some form of depression or anxiety during pregnancy or postpartum.

Creating space for healing is important moms. Teaching our children that healing is needed. Learning to process and deal with your emotions is healthy.
.
.
We can do all those things by taking time to make therapy a priority. Building a healthy support system. Putting your mental health first.
.
.
.
Just think... moms who choose to heal create space for children who won’t need to.

Among such works is "Our God is Great," one of Liu Xi's latest series included in the exhibition. The installation of charcoal black porcelain sculptures of peculiar floral and vulvar forms is laid flat in front of the viewer. Suspiciously referring to female genitalia, the sculptures are evocative of corals, dreary and black, that lay deep at the bottom of the ocean, unable to reveal their bright kaleidoscopic colors due to lack of light from the surface. In such a bold attempt to expose the tantalizing and daring sexual side of femininity, Liu Xi emphatically appeals to women. In the wake of #metoo movement reaching every corner of the world, a young female artist stresses the importance of ‘light’ - illuminating the power of women’s awareness of the full spectrum of their femininity, which enables them to address their needs, desires and ultimately, rights in the most honest and unbiased way.
《我们的神很了不起》是柳溪的最新系列之一，也囊括在本次展览中。炭黑色花朵造型的雕塑装置平铺在观者面前，不难令人联想到女性的私密部位。通过如此大胆地揭露女性诱人而富有挑逗色彩的魅力，艺术家旨在呼吁：女性只有充分意识到自身的全部女性特质，才能以最诚实的方式满足自己的需求和欲望，最终实现自己的权利。

I want to make this very clear for everyone. Firstly, to the left we have an embryo and a fetus. As one of the circled below states that they are individual, they are not. They are solely dependent on the woman until 23 weeks (extremely premature), therefore, they are not people. The rest of the circled, are independent and can live on their own, therefore meaning they are people (yes I know itâ€™s one person aging but at different stages). You are not pro-science and you are not pro-woman. I am extremely disappointed in Micheline Mathews-Roth. ~ðŸ¥‘ #abortion #feminist #prochoice #prolife #feminism #plannedparenthood #mybodymychoice #womensrights #whiteprivilege #abortionismurder #antifeminist #antiabortion  #conservative  #abortionrights #abortionisnotmurder #sexstrike #christiansharialaw #sharialaw #abortions #femaleisthefuture #metoo #stoprapeculture #rapeculture #sharialaw #abortionisnotmurder #blacklivesmatter

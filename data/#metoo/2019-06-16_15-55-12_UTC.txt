#metoo Last night was RAD. Taking my power back, thank you very much. —
I love teaching. I love creating energy in a space. I love building other dancers up, so they can believe in themselves the way I believe in them....And I love sharing stories. This story has no words for now.....I don’t need them. I just wanna groove. Thank you ENDLESSLY to @bcarr11 and @xcelstudios for creating the most magnificent space ever, where as artists, we can all JUST BE. — Somehow I got put in this room to teach a class last night, and I am so grateful for each and every soul that was there to groove with me! Can’t wait to do it again soon! — Also, huge shoutout to @ethanbrasso  and @vallouiee from @_ksudance for assisting last night! Couldn’t have done it without you! #drelakinchoreography #timesup #takingmypowerback #xcelstudios #classishealing #classiswhereitsat #atlantaartist #groove

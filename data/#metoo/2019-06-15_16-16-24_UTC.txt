Repost @preacherlawson: “It’s going to sound silly, but I used to think growing up cows just had milk. I didn’t know the process we put them through in order to eat a cheeseburger. I realize most of us don’t care because we’re not cows but some of us are mothers. We’re different species with the same emotions. Thanks for the meme @milliondollarvegan #Vegan #Mothers #Children”

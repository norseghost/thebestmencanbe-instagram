                        "text": "\u201cI moved to Boston to start at the STM after living in Rome, Italy for 2 years. I started to quickly despise the word \u201ctransition,\u201d as it felt like an excuse for my inability to feel at home in Boston. I moved into a home with five women, none of which were home very often in the first month, and I was missing the food, sights, and friends that I was so enamored with while in Italy. \nAfter some time, my roommates became a little more open and home a little more often, and I began to find a beautiful community. Through the late nights of paper writing at our dinner table, squealing because of yet another mouse sighting, or sitting on the couch watching TV, we created a beautiful and strong community unlike any I had been a part of before. \nI was able to extend this female friendship outside of House of Mouse and find other supportive women in my classes and jobs who allowed me to speak my own voice without fear of judgement. I had never been able to do that before meeting these incredible women. I found role models and mentors in female professors that encouraged me to continue speaking up because my voice was worthy of being heard. \nAs my two years here have gone by, I have realized how important strong female friendships have become to me. I will remember Boston as being the city I lived in when the #MeToo movement became so well-known, and I had women I was able to talk about this monumental moment with and could understand and share how it affected me. The STM is where I wrestled with having my voice be heard in the classroom and fighting those feelings of unworthiness. I will never forget the encouragement, love, and worthiness I felt from my female friends and role models at the STM. I will carry them with me after I leave BC and empower other women to feel as loved and worthy as these women have made me feel.\u201d \u2014 Elly Hahn M.A. '19 #HumansofSTM #HumansofBCSTM"

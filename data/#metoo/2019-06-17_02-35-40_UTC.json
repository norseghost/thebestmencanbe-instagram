                        "text": "Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny by Kate Mann.\n.\n(I have a complex relationship with Father\u2019s Day so I think it\u2019s worth it to spend some time in deeper reflection on the influence of paternal figures in our lives and how they guide our upbringing.) .\n.\nKate Mann, a professor of philosophy at Cornell, has given us a linear, well-formulated, moralistic analysis of misogyny including how it continues in perpetuity. She directly argues against the notion that misogyny manifests as hatred of women by individual men but instead is defined as \u201cthe system that operates within a patriarchal social order to police and enforce women\u2019s subordination and to uphold male dominance.\u201d\n.\nShe leads her charge with anecdotes about Rush Limbaugh\u2019s \u201cSlut\u201d shaming and argument for being owed sexual payment for supporting birth control with tax dollars, Donald Trump\u2019s overt brand of misogyny and Elliot Rodger. (The latter being the Santa Barbra shooter her murdered multiple women and men while executing his manifesto in which he lamented women\u2019s inability to give him what he thought was owned to him.) After setting this stage she shares her core hypothesis in which she proposes \u201ctaking sexism to be the branch of patriarchal ideology that justifies and rationalizes a patriarchal social order, and misogyny as the system that polices and enforces its governing norms and expectations. So sexism is scientific; misogyny is moralistic.\u201d\n.\nThe role women play in reenforcing misogyny is also investigated centering on white women who vote in line with the maintenance of their social status which has been written about extensively. The 2016 election is again a picture perfect anecdote of a qualified female candidate trounced by a misogynist majority, voting in their own self-interest.\n.\nMisogyny continues to support and pervade all male coded positions but has been railed against by modern social movements such as #metoo. Considering this unveiling of individual and group behavior misogyny and it\u2019s support network are predicted to double down in striving ensure that women do not reach the highest levels of career paths or political stations."

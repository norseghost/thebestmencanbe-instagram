It is so important to recognize these signs in people close to us. A strong support system can greatly improve a survivor’s recovery process. An anonymous response to our survey:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
“I felt worthless, I felt like my body had been stolen from me and that I was impure. I stopped doing things that I loved, I stopped being physically active, I got myself into bad situations because I didn’t care what else happened to me, I was suicidal. I still suffer from PTSD, I didn’t learn to cope properly so I relied on self harm. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I couldn’t tell anyone and now only four people know, none of my family members know. I became very withdrawn from family and friends, the only social life I had was online. I didn’t want to participate in school because I didn’t believe I’d survive, I skipped a lot of classes and failed but still managed to graduate.”

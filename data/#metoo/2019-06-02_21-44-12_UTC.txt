For the first time EVER, I splurged and bought a cute workout get up. I’ve always just worked out in what I had. See I have had this mental WAR with my body image ever since I had Remy.  I’d tell myself oh no, you can’t buy new clothes until you hit your goal weight. I hated shopping. HATED IT. Because I’d look at clothes and think, “I haven’t worked hard enough to earn those.” But see what I was missing was ACTUALLY loving myself through my journey. Today, I embraced my body. I bought the new clothes. And I’m going to be happy as hell while I do my workout today. I’m a work in progress but I’m learning to enjoy every step instead of obsessing about what I haven’t accomplished. Love always wins. Oh.. and my leggings have POCKETS 🙌🏻 #fitfam #postpartum #fitmom #betheexample #believeinyourself #bethechange #momlife #girlswholift #stressrelief #dogmom #boymom ##weightloss #strongwomen #michigan #mombod #postpartumbody #postpartumjourney #trusttheprocess #winterworkout #michigan #strongwomen ##womenempowerment #empoweringwomen #empowerment #motherhood#dancer#motherhoodthroughinstagram #momsofinstagram #boxing #girlswhobox #metoo

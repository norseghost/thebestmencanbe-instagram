Feeling #blessed by these #partners @doubledaybooks @simonbooke @flatironbooks for the free advanced copies of what promise to be AMAZING reads!! All of these beauties come out in the next few months, so make sure they’re on your radar. See short synopses below!
•
- THE MOST FUN WE EVER HAD, out 6/25, is “a dazzling, multigenerational novel in which the four adult daughters of a Chicago couple--still madly in love after forty years--recklessly ignite old rivalries until a long-buried secret threatens to shatter the lives they've built.”
- WHISPER NETWORK, out 7/2, is “part page-turning thriller, part smart examination of the #MeToo movement, part feminist rallying cry” about four women who take a stand against their boss, who is surrounded by rumors that he mistreats female colleagues (@thedailybeast)
- GOING DUTCH, out 8/20, is “a sly and humorous portrait of modern relationships,” including (from what I gather from the summary) a love triangle between a gay man, his sugar mama, and a Tinder-esque one night stand - sounds amazing
- THE NEED, out 7/9, is “a subversive, speculative thriller about a scientist and mother of two young children who, by confronting a masked intruder in her home, slips into an existential rabbit hole”

Today I want to remind you to do things just the way you want and what is best for you and your mental health. Dont worry about what others feel or think about it, if you need one day just to be alone, then do that ! if you want to sleep all day - you'll do it! do just what works for you, even tho it may not be understood or accepted by others.

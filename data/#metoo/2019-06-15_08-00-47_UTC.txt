There’s never been a better time to be a woman ✊

The voice of free-thinking, progressive feminists are being heard louder than ever 📣

But even so, gender-based inequality and discrimination still exists. The gender pay gap continues to limit women’s financial independence, whilst 25% of the world's population lives in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws, mostly in Latin America, Africa and Asia. Female CEOs are making headway, but still only make up just 5% of Fortune 500 CEO roles as of 2018 👭 This type of inequality doesn’t just affect women of working age either. 
Sports actives are prohibited in public schools for girls in Saudi Arabia whilst the age of consent for girls is just 14 in Chad, Lesotho, Madagascar and 10 in the West African country of Niger 🤯

We’ve handpicked a range of articles, speakers and opinion pieces that shed light on feminism, from its roots to its victories and on-going battles such as the #MeToo movement.

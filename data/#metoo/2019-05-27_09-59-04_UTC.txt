It‚Äôs my birthday in 3 weeks time, which I am really excited about. This year I will be in Cyprus where I will be connecting with me and reflecting on my journey and setting my new goals and visions for the year ahead.

Before I travel I have the pleasure of delivering a vision board and manifestation workshop to help some amazing souls on the journey they are taking and can‚Äôt wait to inspire them on the path they are taking.

I would love if you can support me in raising money for my chosen charity Food4All and would be grateful if you could support this for my birthday fundraiser üôèüèº In Love & Light

New research from Plan International Australia reveals that girls and young women are concerned about harassment and unequal treatment if they want to become leaders: "The vast majority (81%) of Australian girls and young women believe female leaders were treated unfairly because of their gender. Only 3% said female leaders were ‘never’ treated poorly because of their gender. Globally, 9 in 10 (94%) of girls surveyed said they believed being a leader involved being treated unfairly.

Worryingly, most Australian girls and women surveyed (87%) believe female leaders experience unwanted physical contact while at work. Just 1 per cent of girls disagreed. Globally, the figures were even more alarming, with 93 per cent agreeing that female leaders experience unwanted contact.

In Australia, almost half (43%) of girls and young women surveyed felt that their gender was a barrier to becoming a leader. This is significantly higher than the 5 per cent of boys and young men surveyed. ... 'Why are we still here in 2019? We ought to be doing better by now. Like girls everywhere, Australian girls are confident and they want to succeed in their careers, but they are wary of all that entails. Why would you want to be a leader if that meant you will be harassed, belittled and face an uphill battle at every turn,' [Plan International Australia’s CEO Susanne Legena] said. 'Unfortunately, all around the world – and this is the case in Australia - girls grow up seeing strong, smart, capable female leaders battle against misogyny and a system that does not afford them respect or equality.'"

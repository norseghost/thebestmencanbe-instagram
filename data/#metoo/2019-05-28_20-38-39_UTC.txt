*Trigger Warning: Trauma Recovery* 
It can be hard for me to open up about my pain and trauma, even in vague forms; to honestly discuss the specifics of that pain is even more difficult. Though it can be necessary to work through that discomfort and talk to friends about what I'm going through. Because to be honest with myself, I feel very alone in regards to my pain and history. I may be able to disclose my assaults, though I have never been able to share the full impact they have had on me. I don't know if I will ever be able to accurately tell someone my whole story, though even telling friends some of it, is a step forward. A step towards not feeling so alone.

Let's talk SEXual Harassment! Recently at PAD, we hosted an awareness session on Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) at workplace.
Ms. Madhujit Singh, Founder & CEO of Ananya-Women at Work, presented some really astounding facts and threw light on the misconceptions of sexual harassment at organisations; like how from abuse to assault, anyone from either gender can be a victim or perpetrator of sexual harassment.

The 4-hour session was an eye-opener with in-depth group discussions, 10 case studies and open conversations towards forms of discrimination and unwelcome behaviour. Here's a quick recap of all that happened... #PAD #SexualHarrasment #Advertising #Ananya #WomenAtWork #Metoo #Feminism #PoSHAct #PoSH #SafeWorkplace #Workshop #Session #Hyderabad

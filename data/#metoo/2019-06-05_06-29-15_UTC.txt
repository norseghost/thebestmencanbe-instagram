If you want your followers to see more of you – mix up your content format.

We’ve had this #instagram algorithm thing go trending for a little bit and I’ve been lurking over all the accounts I follow posting the bunch of text telling people to comment “Yes”. When you fear the unknown you tend to side with what seems to 🅱️ the right path without a second thought.

But hear me out on this.

I’m not saying you’re wrong for doing it because with content there is no right or wrong – there’s just do! lmao

But there is doing things just because, and doing things better.

Better your video game.

Better your IG stories game.

Better your caption copy game.

Better your engagement game.

Making these simple changes to your content will favour your followers!

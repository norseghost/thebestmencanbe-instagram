I don’t know about you, but I still have a hard time letting go even with 9 yrs sobriety & being in recovery.  My brother’s passing made me realize that my desire for something does not make me have power over that thing.  I didn’t want Harry to go so soon but no matter how much I wanted him to live, I was completely powerless over him dying. *
God, grant me the SERENITY
To accept the things I cannot change
The COURAGE to change the things I can, And the WISDOM to know the difference.

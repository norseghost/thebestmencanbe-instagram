#InspiredByHer | Amy Wolff is thrilled that her inspirational campaign – which began with uplifting yard signs – has become something of a “global movement,” reminding people from all walks of life that they are worthy and deserving of happiness.

Two years ago, Amy Wolff was inspired to start the “Don’t Give Up” movement after learning of the alarming suicide rates around the area of her Newburg hometown, telling #FoxNews she felt compelled to do something. “I had the idea of staking encouraging yard sign for years but realized this was the time to do it. My husband, Jake, myself and two young daughters knocked on doors asking permission to put the signs in strangers' yards, particularly around the high school,” Wolff said.

Despite initial hesitation to breathe life into what had long been “just a silly idea,” Wolff said she is immensely glad that she did. “I'm a young mom, running another business, already volunteering and already 'too busy', but when we see a need, we should meet a need (within our capacity,)” she told Fox News.

Don't wait for something else to do something important. Don't wait for someone more qualified. Don't wait until you're perfect - spoiler alert: you never will be!” she mused. “Just do the next right thing!”

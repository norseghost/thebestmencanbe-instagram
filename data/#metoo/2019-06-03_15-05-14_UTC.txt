From GFB Nicole:

We had the opportunity to present a combined Students Fight Back and IMPACT Personal Safety workshop at Sage Hill School last week and it was an amazing experience!  It’s always a joy to engage with students who are eager to learn and excited about discovering their strengths. 
We focused heavily on de-escalation & verbal tactics which are useful in all walks of life.  Being able to talk your way out of of fight or dangerous situation and walk away safely is the best self-defense!  But of course we got to practice some full-contact techniques on the padded assailant as well.

Thank you to the staff for bringing us out!  We couldn’t do this without you!

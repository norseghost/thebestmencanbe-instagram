The woman in the illustration is Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women. She is one of the women I've always looked up to, for her consistent effort and persistent action towards achieving gender equality. She has been an advocate for women's rights and she has worked to adopt long-term measures to reduce violence against women in areas of conflict.

Today, I'd like for all of us to acknowledge her effort towards SDG 5. We speak about a number of feminist role models, who are a part of the mainstream feminist movement. However, it is time we speak about women like Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka as well, women who are bringing about Politico-legal change through systematically built resolutions and tangible effort.

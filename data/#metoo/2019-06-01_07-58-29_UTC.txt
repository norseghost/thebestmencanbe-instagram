Last night, I was chatting with a dear friend who said let’s bring back #liberation as our goal. 
Right? Right?!?! Right on! 
I’ve been thinking about liberation all this week. 
#RobertFSmith called his gift to this year’s #Morehouse grads an act of liberation. I don’t think he meant that as liberation from capitalist debt. He meant it as power to the people, not the dollar. #AllPowerToThePeople.

My dear friend wasn’t referencing Robert F. Smith. He was talking #AIM! He meant Indians of all Tribes who led the #OccupationOfAlcatraz and #WARN meaning #WomenOfAllRedNations! 
He meant let’s push for #BlackPower and burn bras for #WomensLib! 
He meant f*ck social movements, let’s rock liberation movements! I’m in. 
Except.... can we up the love vibe? Not so much #FreeLove but the real kind? The dreamy kind that might only exist in movement literature, scholarship, discourse, #BlahBlahBlah? “She’s beautiful when she’s angry.” But she’s also blurry. You know, tears of rage that blur vision but sharpen intellect and political analysis. 
Rage. Outrage. Fury. Fierce. Love. 
#FierceLove is a book by @springwasham.

#ShesBeautifulWhenShesAngry is a film about liberation movements. Have you seen it? #MeToo! 
A thought. A prose poem. A promise. I like it.

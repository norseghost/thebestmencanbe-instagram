Pain almost destroyed me but at some point I said, "NO." For years it drove every decision I made. When I discovered the key to getting my life back, I was able to change my entire situation. Hostage in the Mirror explains what the true picture of success looks like. It is not money or material things, Its the ability to put pain and life's disappointments in its rightful place.

I am amazed at what people consider success. I see them struglling daily to be relevant to others. I witness them trying to be perfect or have the appearance of "Living their best lives." When in reality they are insecure, hurting, angry, unforgiving because someone or something hurt them and they could never recover from it. We can't get those years driven by pain back but we can change our story right now!

Hostage in the Mirror explains what it took for me to stop trying to  subdue my pain with crack, heroin, alcohol,  sex and other forms of addiction. It talks about my struggles with mental ilness from childhood abuse and other traumas. This transparent book was writen to help others by giving them hope. To remind them that they are not alone. If pain didn't take me out it doesn't have to you. It's time to tell pain. "Your time is up." Let me show you how. 
Hostage in the mirror is available in three formats, Ebook, Hardcover and Paperback on amazon. com and on my website. Look in my bio for the link to my website.

DEGENERIS  SHARES PERSONAL STORY OF SEXUAL ABUSE 
Bravo! Once again the 61-year-old #tvpersonality shares #brave personal information. 
Ellen Degeneris talks for the first time about being sexual assaulted as a teenager by her mom's husband. “It’s a really horrible, horrible story and the only reason I’m actually going to go into detail about it is because I want other girls to not ever let someone do that.” Degeneris continues, “It is just time for us to have a voice. It’s time for us to have power.”

Today was nothing short of amazing! I met so many phenomenal women from across the world, including women of color (an important factor)at today's conference. It was an honor to be a guest speaker among fellow CEOs, publishers, and digital trailblazers, discussing topics pertaining to the #MeToo movement, gender diversity in the media, strategic business intelligence, etc. Big thanks to @newspaperworld for the opportunity!

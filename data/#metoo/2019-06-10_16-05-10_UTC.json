I can\u2019t give them their Dad.\n\nIt was actually me that made the decision to leave, so not only can\u2019t I give them their Dad, I also made him go away.\n\nI\u2019m the bad guy.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m often the bad guy but I know that one day they will understand, but for now we have to go through the motions.\n\nAnd this shit is hard.\n\nI underestimated it completely.\n\nI knew it was going to be difficult, but what I didn\u2019t expect was just how tough is was going to be.\n\nThe last 8 months has been the most heart breaking time of my life but also the most happiest.\n\nIt\u2019s a confusing time, they know things are better, they actually prefer it this way but they have lost what they knew.\n\nThey have lost a parent within their home and they miss him daily.\n\nAnd the parent that is here, is stressed, is tired, is losing her shit a little quicker than before because underneath the surface she is having to let go of battles she no longer wants to be a part of.\n\nShe has to build her castle while someone is trying to tear it down.\n\nAnd do it all with a smile on her face.\n\nI maybe the bad guy that they lash out when they haven\u2019t got the answers, or when they don\u2019t understand why he hasn\u2019t called but our bond is getting stronger every day.\n\nWhen they walk up and squeeze me so tight I cant breath, the unexpected kisses I get on my cheek or the little love you\u2019s they whisper to me daily\u2026. I know that through the tantrums, the tears we are building a family full of love and respect.\n\nThe way it should be.\n\nThe decisions you make won\u2019t always be easy\u2026\n.\nYou are going to battle between what you want and what you think you should be doing... But the truth is... This is your life, you only get one shot and for me, I made the decision that was right for us all and in doing that teaching them that their happiness is what\u2019s important.\n\nNot everyone will want you to win, not everyone will be by your side but you know what\u2019s right for you \u2764\ufe0f I can\u2019t give them what they want , I can only give them me and hope that in the end, that will be enough x"

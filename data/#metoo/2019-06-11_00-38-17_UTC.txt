Gotta give this lady a serious shout out 💕 when I told people I was hiring a “coach” the amount of negative feedback I got was insane. Tbh it never mattered because no one knows what I need for myself, besides me. I trusted her, even when I doubted everything around me. Thank you for being apart of my process of healing. I am grateful. #metoo

Reposted from @cathytquinlan -  Lots of questioning regarding brain scans to diagnose mental health...I'm wondering if they were to conduct brain scans while putting patients under stressful situations if this would show how the brain responds to anxiety stress etc. 
Psychiatrists claim that brain scans now show brain changes that “prove” mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and depression, are brain based. There is no scientific evidence to prove this: it remains what the “fine print” in the studies tell you: “suggests,” “may” and “it is hoped.”
“It is well established that the drugs used to treat a mental disorder, for example, may induce long-lasting biochemical and even structural changes [including in the brain], which in the past were claimed to be the cause of the disorder, but may actually be an effect of the treatment.” —Dr.  Elliot Valenstein, biopsychologist, author, Blaming the Brain
“Psychiatry’s claim that mental illnesses are brain diseases is “a claim supposedly based on recent discoveries in neuroscience, made possible by [brain] imaging techniques for diagnosis and pharmacological agents for treatment.

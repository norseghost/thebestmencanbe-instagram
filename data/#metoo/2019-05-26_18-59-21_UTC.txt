I think if you scroll done on my account I also have a post on signs of emotional, verbal, and physical abuse. Remember if you are getting abused by a partner it’s NOT your fault, because abusers tend to make the ones they abuse feel that way. Also, my DMs are open so if any of you need help of any kind, I’m here.

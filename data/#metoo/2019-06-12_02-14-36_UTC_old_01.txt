Hello Instagram world, this is me letting you all know that I am alive. Busy, but alive ✌️

After writing enough songs to fill up two albums, I’ve hit a wall. Not writers block, per say. It’s more.... every waking minute of my day is spent working on my business and the leftover minutes are me just trying to keep my head afloat. Also, I’m deathly afraid of going back to venues after being roofied. Music has taken a back seat - sure, I teach it every day, but I’ve developed an anxiety that goes along with it. After all, how can I be a musician and a performer if I’m afraid to step foot into a venue without a wall of people watching to make sure I’m safe? I’ve rejected playing more shows than I can count on my hands because of an irrational fear of being drugged. That being said, all the anxiety and negativity is starting to calm down - the storm of not knowing what I’m doing in life or how to process what I’ve been thrown is subsiding and I’m starting to regain my footing as a person, artist and musician. There’s talk of recording my music this summer, and I’ve even considered not rejecting being on a show (if I’ve turned you down in the past I’m SO SORRY, you’re all so talented and I mean no disrespect!!!!). Here’s to summer 2019, to making music with good friends ✨ #survivor #singersongwriter #singer #musician #instamusic #phillyartist #philadelphiamusician #metoo #recording

Loving myself after being victimized was my biggest challenge and my biggest victory. Fallen and broken, my spirit was shattered but I rose and found the phoenix in me to fight my right to live and not just survive. It is not enough to continue breathing but it is necessary to live those moments that take your breath away, to feel the warmth of complete peace and to find the self worthy of divinity. I am a survivor, a warrior, a Phoenix... I am divine, perfect within each scar and crack, complete in my victories and my desire of truly living. #iamyesenia #iamme #divine #complete #perfect #survivor #warrior #phoenixintherising #justthebeginning #mexicangamora #proud #conlafrenteenalto #metoo #didntbreakme #loveyourself #lovingmyself

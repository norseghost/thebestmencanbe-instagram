This month is PTSD awareness month! PTSD stands for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Many of us growing up may have believed that PTSD only affected war vets. The truth is Women experience PTSD double the rate of men. This doesnâ€™t negate the fact that men experience PTSD at alarming rates and they too need help. 3 common traumatic experiences for women that may cause them to be diagnosed with PTSD are: 
1. Sexual assault 
2. Domestic Violence 
3. Sexual Abuse 
Unfortunately, women donâ€™t report these experiences as often which leads to untreated mental issues, and not being aware of what it is they are dealing with. Triggers vary based on the trauma, the individual and how that person coped. 
Mental health is important!! PTSD does NOT define who we are! 
We are P.T.S.D.... PROUD TOUGH STRONG DETERMINED!!!!! ðŸ’šðŸ’• #journey2freedom #womenempowerment #womeninspiration #mentalhealthawareness #personalblogs #inspirationalquotes #whyididntreport #metoo #womenempowerment #womeninspiringwomen #womensupportingwomen #women  #anxiety #mentalhealthissues #ptsd #depression#mentalhealthmatters #blacktherapist #therapy #mentalhealthawareness #healthylifestyle #exercise

I was sexually assaulted today walking down the LA street that I live on. A young man grabbed my breasts as I was walking past him. He looked at me like he had just given me the greatest gift I'd ever receive. I chased after him, yelling "you just sexually assaulted me", hitting and punching him. He looked at me unremorsefully and said "Hey, I like tits!" as if he deserved mine for just liking them. I recorded a video of it and got his face on the video, but my iPhone didn't save it when I clicked stop. There were other men standing around who heard what was going on and did absolutely nothing to help me.

Men: I do not exist to decorate your streets or satisfy your sexual desires. Also, if you witness someone being assaulted, fucking help them. 
Teach your sons. You do not put your hands on another person without asking first. You treat ALL people like you would want your child to be treated. You respect people's right to not interact with you. It does not matter what they are wearing, if you have slept with them before, if they are drunk or sober, or if they are your spouse. No means NO. #metoo #sexualassault

Update: Los Angeles is a great place. I don't feel unsafe here. There are predators everywhere, not just cities.

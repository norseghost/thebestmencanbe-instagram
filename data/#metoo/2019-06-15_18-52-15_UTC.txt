How my beginners get down on a Tuesday 😏😈😍💜 Are you coming to join us soon 👀??? Read below for more info:
🚨
6.15-7.30pm Beginners @ Flow 
This class is to focus on technique and learning a short combo. A great entry class with all the support and sass 💁🏻 Focusing on walks, turns, floor work, hair whips, balance and all the things to get you ready in your heels! 
8.30-10pm Beginners @ Gym Box
A class to concentrate on performance more with longer time and a longer routine. Still time for technique and tricks but a class to get your confidence up with performing! 🚨
Both classes all you need is yourselves, your heels (or even flats if you’re worried for now), knee pads - because it’s me, and a lot of energy to share with everyone because we come to have a good time!!!! Tickets are in my BIO and we will not be taking cash payments. 
See you Tuesday 💜🙏🏽 #heelsandfeels

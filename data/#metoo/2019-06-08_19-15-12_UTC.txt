One of my goals in life is to help inspire someone to overcome life’s challenges and live in their purpose. .
.
I’ll never forget the day this picture was taken. It was the first day I admitted out loud to others and to myself,  that I was once a victim of rape. .
.
You see IG and FB provides us a space to wrap ourselves up in the “perfect” looking package. We share all the triumphed moments and no one wants to talk about how we got there. .
.
At 15 I was raped by a family friend and I never told a soul until this day in 2015. I stood on stage and told my entire story and the face of the crowd was in shock. .
.
To me it was just life. Normal circumstances. Things I have dealt with everyday. But rather then bask in my sorrow, I decided to find a way to channel the negative feelings into something positive. .
.
The story continues, but the rest will be for another day. Just remember that what you see on social media maybe a by product of something way more complex then you can even imagine. .
.
Stay strong, continue to a path of greatness and know that you are not alone in this world. Someone else shares you pain and your happy moments. Don’t bottle them up. Find someone who shares them and heal each other. You are great too! #entrepreneurship #yolo #metoo #overcome

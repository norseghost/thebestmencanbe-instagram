What about the mental damage? Imagine filming a rape scene?\n\u2800\nFew takeaways from writer-actor-director Terry McMahon and intimacy coordinator-movement director Ita O'Brien that I got:\n\u2800\n\u2022\tAgree on level of nudity, discuss and rehearse the scene prior to shoot. Sign those forms.\n\u2800\n\u2022\tSpeak with each actor in private first, to establish their boundaries. Check past trauma to make sure it doesn't get triggered. Know that consent can change from yes to no and another way around at the rehearsals or on set.\n\u2800\n\u2022\tNo objectifying. Use proper language to describe body parts, movements etc.\n\u2800\n\u2022\tAgree physical touch. At rehearsals make sure each body part that is being touched/kissed is discussed and agreed upon.\n\u2800\n\u2022\tHave a timeout sign which actors can use to stop the scene if at any time they feel uncomfortable.\n\u2800\n\u2022\tAsk actors not to involve any emotions at the rehearsals stage. Use it purely for blocking. This will ensure that actors don't give \"their all\" to a performance before camera can capture it.\n\u2800\n\u2022\tIt should be a closed set for the whole duration of the shoot for the intimate scene (and not just for the takes). Phones and monitors are to be switched off, only those who absolutely need to be there present.\n\u2800\n\u2022\tSchedule intimate scenes for the morning and discuss hygiene, make sure actors come in showered.\n\u2800\n\u2022\tGet actors to try on bits of intimate wardrobe (like genital covers) before the shoot to make sure they fit.\n\u2800\n\u2022\tNudity is only from \"action\" to \"cut\" - get actors covered straight away after the \"cut\" and keep them covered until just before \"action\".\n\u2800\n\u2022\tAnd finally, have actors do some movement routine to get out of the character and back into their own selves after the shoot.\n\u2800\nOk, here it is, I hope you find it useful.

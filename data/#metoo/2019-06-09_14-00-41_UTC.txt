Walking into The Artist Outpost it has the feel of a hidden Gem in Soho or Williamsburg but you’re in East Harlem.  A chic, eclectic clothing store hiding away an inspirational, socially conscious art gallery. The Art Gallery was aflame with activity Thursday night. The first exhibit “erotic feminist in the me too era” was making its NYC splash. People came from all over the city and the burbs to check it out. The best part were the conversations that lingered. Is #metoo still relevant? What can we do about Helping the women in Alabama? how can we help each other? “It filled a small part of me to be able to give women a stage to share their voice, their stories, and their passions,” says Stacey Van Gorder, co- curator of the exhibit.

“For me to be able to put together this all female show representing the ‘Me Too Rebellion’ is what I imagined while creating The Artist Outpost.  Stacey and I produced a show that not only featured exquisite artwork,  but more importantly gave women a safe environment to meet, talk and unite about the current issues we’re facing today.  Our mission for this show was to give our guests the opportunity to talk freely amongst themselves with no judgement, while also bringing together a cultivated show of art, culture, and fashion.”

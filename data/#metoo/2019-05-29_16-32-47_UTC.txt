Hi there friends, 
So today is day 173 off of Valium that the doctors had me on for over a decade. I have been in a wave the last couple of days from this benzo brain injury which has included nausea and vomiting, disassociation, derealization, dizziness, a spinny feeling like I just got off of the gravatron at the fair and the feeling of being on a big rocking boat in the ocean which has been incessant for the last 48 hours. ðŸ˜ž The doctors took me off of the Maximum dose of Valium in less than 4 days and I think that is why I am having such a hard time. However, I have had days and even weeks wave free. For now I am just going to rest and ride this damn thing because thatâ€™s my only choice. Please remember that everyone elseâ€™s symptoms in benzo withdrawal do NOT mean that they will happen to you. I am just here to share my personal journey and try and help others going through this. Sending love to anyone else out there experiencing a wave. ðŸŒŠ This too shall pass. .

Your own little narrator.\n\nThey don\u2019t tell the beautiful details of your day to day life like your favourite romantic movie.\n\nOh no.. what they do is offer an opinion on everything.\n\nEverything you have done in the past, everything you want to do in the future and all that in between.\n\nAnd this story teller isn\u2019t always your friend.\n\nSo you have to be aware of what story you are allowing in.\n\nAre you the bad guy?\n\nAre you the one who can\u2019t do it so may as well give up?\n\nOr are you the hero?\n\nI\u2019m going to guess more often then not the little narrator makes you the villain.\n\nSo what if we replaced those stories, with ones that were more empowering?\n\nHere are some things you can do to make your storyteller your number 1 fan:\n\n1. Be aware of narrator and the story he is telling you - It all starts with awareness. Bringing it into your consciousness rather than being oblivious to how many negative stories you are hearing inside your own head everyday.\n\n2. Write down what he says - Try to get it word for word. The chances are, it won\u2019t be the first time you\u2019ve heard that line, whether it be \u2018I\u2019m not  good enough\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m so lazy\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ll never be able to do it\u2019. Ask yourself: what is the story I am telling myself right now?\n\n3. Time for evaluation! - it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the story and believe it\u2019s the truth. But it\u2019s only one prospective, usually based on fear and previous experiences.\n\nAsk yourself: is this story just a limiting belief? Am I holding back to protect myself?\n\n4. Truth bomb - most people doubt their beliefs and believe their doubts. They make the fears the truth!\n\nAsk yourself: What do I know to be true?\n\n5. Time to write a new story - what if you could do the things you want? Hit your goals and create the experiences you crave?\n\nAsk yourself: what do you really want? Maybe write your dream day? Or do your vision board?\n\nFind out what\u2019s important to you and start creating the story of the life you want, not listening to the voice of fear inside your head \u2764\ufe0f"

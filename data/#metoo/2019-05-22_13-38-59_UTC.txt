Today is the day! At our #GirlsToo Teen Talk event today, teens will be talking about how we can shift the deeply entrenched norms fueling the epidemic of sexual harassment that girls and boys face. We can create a healthier, safer culture for all. It starts by listening to young people. 
Watch the livestream on our Instagram @girlsinc at 5:30pm ET to follow along.

â€˜Mother and Childâ€™ is a memorial to all victims of sexual violence around the world, and has been designed and made by artist @rebeccahawkinssculpture - It is based on the concept of the Strangler Fig tree, a parasitic plant which takes over a host tree by entwining itself around its roots, trunk and branches, and is common in Vietnam. ðŸ—£ Earlier this week, at the JLDH event in Westminster, the sculpture was unveiled; you can see what Rebecca had to say on our website - Link in bio!

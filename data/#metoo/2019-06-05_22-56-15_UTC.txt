This is me with my absolute hero the one and only @eveensler I have just written a blog post about her newest book @theapology. Read here- www.marcellahoward.com/blog
 It has taken me a week to write as I read her book three times and had to really digest what it meant for me as a woman, as a parent and as a therapist. I am inspired by Eves  astounding bravery to face the pain and delve into the depths of her internal reality and to the truth of her story and to then share that journey with all the heart. May we all find this kind of strength on the journey to freedom #eveensler #theapologybook #healing #traumatherapy #metoo #inspiration #survivorspeaks #findingfreedom #feelingwhole #heartcentred #truth #beingheard #beingseen #truthmatters #sayingsorry #gender #violenceagainstwomen #stopviolenceagainstwomen #vulnerable #strongwoman #onebillionrising #vday #vaginamonologues #cityofjoycongo

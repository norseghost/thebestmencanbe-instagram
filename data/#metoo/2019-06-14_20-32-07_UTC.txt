I am.

1 in 5 women who have been sexually assaulted.

This is what I was wearing the first time it happened.

I was doing my job.
.
I do not owe you any more of an explanation.

I did not report.
Most women won’t. Abusers count on this. Abusers count on YOU making the victim’s actions partly responsible for the attack they experienced.
.
It doesn’t matter what you wore. It doesn’t matter where you were. It doesn’t matter who he was.

No one has the right to touch you without you consent.
.
Sexual assault and rape are about power and control. Full stop.

Today is World Blood Donor Day!! ‚ù§  Unfortunately, the FDA requires all gay men to "completely abstain from any sexual activity for 12 months" before being permitted to donate blood.  THIS IS DISCRIMINATION!! All blood is thoroughly tested for known diseases before entering the recipient market.  Don't knock it until you've tested it!
EVERY DROP COUNTS & OUR BLOOD CAN SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE TOO!! üåà
Spread the word and save a life.

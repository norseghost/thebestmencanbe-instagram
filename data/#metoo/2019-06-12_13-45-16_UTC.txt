NYT Critic's Pick - "That’s a change this delicious, admirably clear production, directed by Kenny Leon, acknowledges and builds on as it gently but firmly escorts the great comedy into a #MeToo, Black Lives Matter world. … That’s what’s so successful about this fresh version of one of Shakespeare’s most popular plays: Its politics, though unmistakable, cloud neither the romance nor the comedy.” - Jesse Green.

                        "text": "My brain has been doing it\u2019s thing today ... I\u2019ve been thinking about writing for a while now. I guess I just didn\u2019t have the courage before.\n\nI could think of all the reasons I SHOULDN\u2019T break the silence; \u2018who am I to talk?\u2019, \u2018will everyone think it\u2019s wanky?\u2019, \u2018I don\u2019t even know where to start\u2019. But still my insides kept telling me that I really, really should.\n\nBecause I know I am not alone. I simply can not be the only woman who became a mum and then slowly, silently disappeared.\n\nYou all know that I went to Japan recently ... but you don\u2019t know what got me there in the first place. It is a LONG story, and it\u2019s going to take some time and thoughtfulness to tell it in a way that makes sense. But the first few paragraphs have been written and it feels good.\n\nI always thought my \u2018role\u2019 in life was the same thing as my \u2018job\u2019 or the thing I do to earn a living. It turns out that the two things have nothing to do with each other at all.\n\nThe world is changing and I think so many of us are frantically trying to find a foothold. I\u2019m not sure where I will be when everything starts to settle down again (if it ever does), but I do believe that if the world is going to really change, we all need to start talking about the real life shit. It\u2019s not just about the headliners like #metoo or #timesup. I\u2019m not a feminist. But It\u2019s clear by now that the patriarchy does need to diversify, and a big part of that means learning to become comfortable with the intrinsic discomfort of femininity. We women don\u2019t always know the answer. We don\u2019t always WANT an answer. We are comfortable sitting with our feelings, expressing them in any way we can and deciphering them if there is a meaning to be had.\n\nSo this is my purpose... to shine a light on a pervasive issue that is rife amongst women; women and mums who have spent so long being everything to everyone, that we forget WHO WE ARE in the process.\n\nThis is real. It is everywhere. It needs to stop. \nMy blog lives at how-to-be.com.au. I\u2019d love to chat with you there! xx"

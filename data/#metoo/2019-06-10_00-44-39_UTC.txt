For years, I felt like I was struggling to keep my head above water. But I can tell you this, there’s nothing like finding out you have a year to live to motivate a major life change. ⠀
⠀
I’m an all-or-nothing person, so when I was diagnosed with cancer, I dove in, did the research and came up with a PLAN. But I wish I hadn’t waited until I was diagnosed with a disease to get proactive about my health. The fact of the matter is that the majority of issues facing Americans today could be PREVENTED. ⠀
⠀
If you’re struggling to come up with a plan that works for YOU, I’d love to help. ⠀

I have a few more one-on-one coaching slots open. This is a special time where I get to meet with you, discuss your exact situation, and help you come up with a game plan for your health. I’m including a link in my bio for anyone who’s interested! <3

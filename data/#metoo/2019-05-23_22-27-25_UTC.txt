Do you know this awesome lady? Yes? Great! No? Well, then may we may introduce you to Tarana J. Burke @taranajaneen, a women's rights activist and founder of the Me Too movement! .

Tarana has been advocating for #equality for more than 10 years.  In 2017 the Me Too movement gained momentum thanks to more and more women speaking out about sexual abuse and violence (esp. in the wake of the Weinstein revelations), sharing their stories under the hashtag #metoo and causing uproar not only in the film industry .

Tarana is grateful for the attention however she still sees a lack of black/poc perspectives in the discussion, and hopes for more stories of healing: "I want to teach people to not lean into their trauma. You can create the kind of joy in your life that allows you to lean into that instead." she said in an interview with the @nytimes . .

Therefore, she has new plans for the community and website which will be launched soon. Follow Tarana and stay tuned on news about the #metoomovement !

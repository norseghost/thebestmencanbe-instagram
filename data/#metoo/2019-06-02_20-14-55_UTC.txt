Interesting article in @financialtimes about racism in football by @sterling7 - does it go far enough and in depth enough? No, but something we should all think about. As a brown faced woman, I have experienced racism and sexism all my life but with the far right movements gaining power across Europe and the USA, it’s an interesting debate. 
Spent time with my parents this week, who came over as immigrants in the ‘70’s and were welcomed with open arms as a workforce. Where did that open mindedness & generosity go?
I do applaud you Raheem @sterling7 for trying to make a change. You cannot be defined by the colour of your skin but only by the difference you make in life. Keep pushing those barriers 🙏 👏🏻 👏🏻 #fuckracism #racism #mancity #raheemsterling #metoo #blacklivesmatter #fitfam #financialtimes #football #timeforachange

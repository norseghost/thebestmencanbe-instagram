Itâ€™s all about the brows, apparently?! How huge have brows become in female beauty standards?! A little pluck is nowhere near meeting the expectations these days.... you best be threading, shaping, waxing, dying, microblading, filling, shadowing, gelling... arghhhhhhhhh!!! My brows are lucky if they get a pluck inbetween once a week. If someone judges me because I donâ€™t have them perfectly preened, boy bye ðŸ‘‹

After Hrithik decided to avert the clash between Mental Hai Kya and Super 30, Ekta Kapoor has also decided to shift Jabariya Jodi to a different date, to give both the films a breathing space.
Hrithik Roshan's Super 30 has already had a few shifts in its release dates. The drama was about to hit screens last November but after Vikas Bahl's name got embroiled in the #MeToo controversy, it was scheduled to release only in January. But soon, Kangana Ranaut decided to lock horns with her long time enemy at the box office. Good sense prevailed and the clash was averted. But only till Ekta Kapoor decided to come with Mental Hai Kya on the same day as Super 30. 
Before the mud slinging could take a different turn, the Kaabil actor sent out a statement confirming that he's removing his film from the said date. But little did Ekta know that Sajid Nadiadwala and Duggu will instead clash with her other pet project Jabariya Jodi. There has been a lot of idhar udhar happening on Balaji's films too. The Sidharth Malhotra and Parineeti Chopra starrer also got postponed from its earlier May date to July 12. 
Now, it seems the romcom that revolves around groom kidnapping will again change its dates. "Ekta and Hrithik are friends. He decided to shift his film to give Ekta a proper release for Mental Hai Kya and avoid all controversies. Now, Ekta is also contemplating to return the favour by avoiding the clash between Jabariya Jodi and Super 30. She will be sitting for a meeting and taking a call on the new release date. She understands that clashing would mean a loss for both films, and she doesn't want it. Jabariya is a film that is important for everyone involved.

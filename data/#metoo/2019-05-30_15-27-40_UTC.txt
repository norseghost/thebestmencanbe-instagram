I personally do not believe in abortion. However, it is not my job to convey or push my personal opinions on others. My job is to uphold the law, a law that is just and righteous. With that being said, I do not support a law that does not uphold justice to certain individuals and in this case rape survivors and survivors of incest. It is not just to criminalize survivors who were stripped of a choice on whether they would want to have sex much less a baby. It is not righteous to extend the privilege of being called a father to an individual whom acted unjust to gain such a privilege. #imagainsttheheartbeatbill #blackattorneys #femaleattorney #ispoke #legislative #louisianalaw #attorneyatlaw #metoo #entrepreneur #lawyer

First Post:
......I just wanted to address what kind of account this is and my personal stances.
......This account is going to be for feminists both young and old, male and female. I will post as often as possible. I will have things about current issues and past issues, mostly to do with feminism.
......I am a feminist. I believe that no one should be discriminated against in any situation due to the things we should all be the most proud of, our race, ethnicity, and gender.

I AM NOT FIGHTING FOR WOMEN TO BE BETTER THAN MEN.

I want to be clear about my definition of being a feminist. I am simply an advocate of women's rights on the basis of creating equality for men and women throughout the world, in the workplace and in societal norms.
......I am pro-choice. Even though I do not personally believe that abortions are right in most cases, I do believe that it is a women's choice whether or not to receive an abortion and that men should not be the ones to govern that right. I am in no way able to judge that right either even as a women because I know nothing about what that person has going on in their life and why they used abortion, typically as a last resort.
......I am a teen, who sees the problems of the world daily in school, home, and church and is just trying to advocate the change of some of the problems we face throughout the world.
......Thank you for reading this and I hope you can help to create this change as well. Please share this account and help it get out to make a bigger difference.

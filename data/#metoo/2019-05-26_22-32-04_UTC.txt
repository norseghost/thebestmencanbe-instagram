Definition: .
Sensory integration: A form of occupational therapy in which special exercises are used to strengthen the patient's sense of touch (tactile), sense of balance (vestibular), and sense of where the body and its parts are in space (proprioceptive). It appears to be effective for helping patients with movement disorders or severe under- or over-sensitivity to sensory input.

Sensory integration has also tremendously helped me with feeling grounded if I feel disassociation/derealization or depersonalization. As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and trauma it is important for me to stay present and remember that I am safe as an adult. I find that touching different textures helps me tremendously in feeling grounded if I‚Äôm ever feeling checked out. This is also helping me while going through benzodiazepine withdrawal as I am healing from this benzo brain injury and have been feeling really disassociated/not present and like I‚Äôm floating outside of my body. Another example of this is wrapping up with a super soft blanket or a weighted blanket and touching interesting textures which can really help calm you down if you are experiencing disassociation, anxiety, depression, PTSD, CPTSD or feel overwhelmed by the outside world. üíô‚ô•Ô∏è .

I’ve been trying to figure out how to put this into words for a long time. 
Bear with me. 
The good news is we have woken up as a society to respect and tolerance. With movements like #MeToo and the fight for gender equality- we are getting somewhere as a nation. 
We have also become hyper sensitive in my opinion, to jokes and light humour.... which I think we so desperately need right now. SNL used to make fun of every minority under the sun (mine included) and we laughed. It was funny. But recently, it feels like we can’t laugh anymore. 
For me, it comes down to intent. Which I think is everything. 
If I make a mistake, but say it with pure and good intent, can you not FIRST correct me and teach me the right way, and then move on? Do we have to get so stuck?
If you go to @samantharonson and @sophiabush’s recent Instagram posts, someone did a great job there. Read that post (the one with all the words). It’s a thank you message. It basically sums up how I feel. And I think it’s really good. 
Let’s all get off our high horses and acknowledge those that are just learning or trying to make any small change for the better (even if they fuck up unknowingly on their path to goodness). I still think intent is everything. If your intent is pure, I’m gonna be okay with you.
For me... INTENT TRUMPS EVERYTHING. 
What do you think?
There, I finally got that out. 
I hope you catch my drift. :)

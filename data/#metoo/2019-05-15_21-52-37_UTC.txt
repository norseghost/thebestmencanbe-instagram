I made this for myself when I finally left my abuser in December of 2013, while in art therapy at a crisis house. It was meant to serve as a reminder I deserve safety, security and love. No more abuse. I still have it. I never went back to him after this day.

There is no shame is reaching out for help. It’s OK to not be OK. ❤️🙏 Your life matters!

Why are rapists treated as innocent until proven guilty; but I, as a rape survivor, am treated as a liar until proven otherwise? With no regards towards my trauma, PTSD, suicide attempts, or endless hours of therapy. You know itâ€™s a messed up world when they care more about perpetrators than victims.

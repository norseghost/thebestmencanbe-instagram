Coffee and wrapping up enrollments today for my FREE two week summer sneak peak of the fitness programs I‚Äôve been using. ‚ö°Ô∏èWhat it is: 14 Days of one of my favorite fitness programs. No upfront fees, just show up and work your üçëoff! 
To get the best experience possible, I'm asking you to commit to these 14 Days with no excuses, completing every workout. 
After its over, if you've completed every single workout I'll be available for a 15min 1:1 call with you to talk though your experience, how it felt and what your goals are moving forward. 
This is ONLY happening once this summer, so get ready to work and have fun together doing these home workouts together! 
Steps to join:
- DM me your email - I'll send you a link to sign up
- Once you sign up, email me a screen shot of your receipt
- Then you'll be added to our private group on FB + we will kick it off on 6/10!! .

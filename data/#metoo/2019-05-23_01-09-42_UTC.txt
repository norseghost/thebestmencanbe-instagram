What’s your Rapunzel story? Most of us have one. A story of hardship, struggle, survival, and renewal! ✊🏻
***
A new section is being added to the Red Rapunzel site, honoring all self-rescued women, aka Red Rapunzels. 🏰
***
If you or someone you know have a Rapunzel story they’d like to share, I’d love to include it on our mission to support and empower women. Stories can be posted anonymously if you’re not comfortable putting your business out there, or you’re welcome to include a small bio and pic 🤷🏼‍♀️ It’s all up to you. The power is yours ladies! And that will never change no matter how hard they try ✊🏻
***
I see you, love you, honor you, uplift you, and empower you! 💪🏻

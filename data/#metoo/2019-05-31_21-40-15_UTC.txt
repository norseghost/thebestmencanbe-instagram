We did a survivor workshop at SOAS university today with Not The Only One and I can’t describe this special thing that happens when we manage to create a space where survivors of sexual violence can safely come together and hear and see each other, often for the first time. So I thought I’d share this poem a survivor once sent me after a workshop, capturing all of this so much better than I could. ❤️ #survivor #metoo #survivoractivism #nottheonlyone #poem

As we close out this analysis of The Cycle of Abuse as told through the eyes of Jeannie Mai and her mother, we want to be sure to tell you that healing is possible. Granted, it will look different for every survivor and family.
In Jeannie's case, she was estranged from her mother for 8 years before they were able to reconcile after her mother failed to believe her when she disclosed that she had been sexually abused by a family member. In a touching and emotional moment Mama Mai revealed that she eventually confronted Jeannie's abuser and Jeannie breaks down in tears and tells her all she ever needed was to know that her mother believed her, supported her and defended her.
Jeannie has used her celebrity to share her story and to become an avid supporter of child sex abuse and sex trafficking prevention.
It is important however, that we tell you that your healing may look very different. You may not reconcile with your family, you may never get them to say they believe you and support you, and you may never have a public platform to tell your truth. Healing may require that you create healthy connections with other people you call family.  A good counselor can help you create and implement your healing plan.
We, at Comfort In The Storm, want you to know we believe you and your truth matters! **SEE FULL VIDEO HERE OR ON OUR FACEBOOK PAGE**** https://youtu.be/oAU_3WRnvkY

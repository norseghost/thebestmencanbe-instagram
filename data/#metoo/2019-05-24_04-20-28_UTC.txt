Picture this. I (me, this user, the woman posting this) am grabbing a quick lunch in a restaurant when I go into cardiac arrest. The men around me refuse to do CPR on me because of feminists, whose ideas I detest. So I die because of the identity politics I hate. That seems fair. ðŸ¤” I'm going to wear a big star that says "I AM NOT A FEMINIST, I WILL NOT #METOO YOU FOR SAVING MY LIFE" after I turn 50.

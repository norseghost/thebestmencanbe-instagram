In the era of FB and IG, everyone has become an activist. Remember: #Activists and Freedom Fighters existed before social media (and effected the real changes that allow for our voices today). #Technology makes our voices faster and louder, but whether the voices are lasting, or if they’ll only perpetuate the problem is our other collective challenge. An activism that is not connected to grounded #spiritual and psychological self-awareness and rooted in #compassion will only divide and disconnect (no matter the righteous intentions). Leveraging it all, yess, but with or without social media we can and must show up and do the everyday “unsexy” work of creating practical #solutions, #connections and (expanding ourselves enough) to build the bridges necessary to support our next generations. Freedom, change and transformation starts with each person. It starts with you. That wisdom will become the most powerful force — even if our FB and IG is deleted or shuts down. #losangeles #connection #feminism #sanfrancisco #leadership #confidence #activism #servantleadership #metoo #timesup #womensempowerment #facebook #instagram #womensrights #discipline #leadershipcoaching #lifecoach #purposedrivenlife #focus #freedom #socialimpact #changestartswithin @coachlyndanguyen

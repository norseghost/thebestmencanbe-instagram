I never know what script will arrive in my hands üé¨Cut to...my audition yesterday...a woman who had been treated unjustly. I had to dig so very deep to the place inside of me where the perceptions of my soul journey needed to SCREAM and cower at societies mistakes and human error and neglect of the heart.  The only way to not carry it with me out of the room was to leap into the abyss and give voice to the rage, fear, anger that we as women are told is inappropriate and unladylike, crazy, out of control, downright powerful and yes intimidating. . I needed to LEAP and then...walk away knowing in some way, something in the world and in me was healed simply by this fleeting moment, caught on film in full FU*!ing force. 
Inside EVERY woman is the raging voice of the universe.  The women who runs with the wolves. Some call this voice a whisper.  BUT...Just because it‚Äôs been silenced and ignored doesn‚Äôt mean it is meek and soft. It is loud and bold and fearless ~ it is no more of a whisper than a cyclone on a sweet summer day üíñ! Give her voice back my love. I dare you not to smile when you say...‚Äùactually I can!‚Äù ‚Ä¢

This is one of the most painful things I've written in a while. I dropped the anger for a second to write to my best friend/roomate pre-assault who stayed friends with my abuser/roomate and told me she was happy I was moving away because "they were going to have so much more space" and then told me I had made her horribly depressed. My friends really just fucking dropped my ass and wrote me off as too emotional. I was told by her boyfriend, "I better not ever see you again" so I'm pretty terrified when I see them around town. #metoo

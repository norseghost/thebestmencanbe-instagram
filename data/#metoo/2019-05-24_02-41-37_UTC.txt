Wow what a day ðŸ’— I shared the most personal thing I have gone through so far in my life (in my stories). I was nervous to do it but it was a huge relief after and I don't feel alone at all now. I had someone point it out that me gaining confidence helped me share something so intimate with you guys. She was right! I just want to thank you for being so understanding and sweet. I also want to say if you have been or are being a victim of sexual assault that you are 100% not alone! Whether it happened last year or 10 years or 20 years ago it still matters. And your healing process matters and I hope you get all that you need to heal. If not, message me or check out the hotline number I left in my stories that I personally have used multiple times and recommend ðŸ¦‹ I care so much about you guys and the messages I received today is overwhelming and does leave me with a heavy heart that this happened to so many other women but we can find comfort in one another and uplift each other because the other side of sexual assult is being a survivorâœ¨ XO

To my fellow #survivors 💪🏽of sexual abuse, this article is dedicated to you and to those who know someone who is a survivor, I hope this gives some insight into how to support her/him. Read it via my link in bio ☝🏽 Thank you @swaaymedia for giving me a platform to talk about #survivorship and how important it is for people to understand the ongoing struggle of survivors. We've had so many pop culture moments lately that have revealed the general public just don't "get it" when it comes to the ongoing struggle of survivors of sexual abuse from childhood into adulthood. We need to educate people on this topic. From comments like "It didn't kill them..." by Barbara Streisand regarding the men speaking out in the documentary @leavingneverlandofficial Leaving Neverland to the commentary during the Kavanaugh hearing, there is a lot to be learned about #PTSD and survivorship, and my essay offers some insight on how the community at large can be more supportive. It's not an easy topic, but it should be one that we openly discuss and understand since unfortunately it is so pervasive in our society--across race, gender, age and class.

Beastie Boys, "Ill Communication" 1994

On any given day my favorite Beasties album, this masterpiece turns a very timeless 25. Kicking off with the flute-driven "Sure Shot" (and its iconic apology for past behavior, a move that many people could learn from in the #metoo era), the album is a non-stop melange of instrumental prowess and slick rhymes. "Check Your Head" may have some cooler songs, but this entire album is of a piece. We still miss you Yauch.

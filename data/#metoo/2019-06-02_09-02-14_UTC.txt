@_rodent__ performance last night of #aileenwuornos final interview with #eurythmics #sweetdreams shook me to the damn core. It left me pulsating with rage, fear of the blatant corruption were compliant with, and frustration with #fosta #sesta #abortionrights and people with NO damn clue about what it’s like to have your body taken away from you, making decisions about it. This isn’t a political conversation, it’s about our lives being shaped by #misogyny since childhood, and the daily reality of living in fear of violence

Memorial day weekend means remembering those weâ€™ve lost, friendly gatherings, and the opening of pools. Putting on a swim suit, especially at parties can make a survivor feel vulnerable and bring up past trauma. If you're feeling uncomfortable or triggered this summer and need to chat, we're here. Even on holidays, even today, even right now.  1-844-237-2331.

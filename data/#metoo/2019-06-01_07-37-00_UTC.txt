This is what I love about Avon..
For reps it's not all about selling and for customers it's not all about buying..
Avon do so much to empower women and have been doing so ever since they started. Avon have done so much for Breast Cancer awareness and have donated Â£2.4M to charities helping to stop domestic violence, unfortunately something very close to my heart. 
I love with Avon that you can do good, feel good and look good ðŸ’„

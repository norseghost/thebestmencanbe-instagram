[Album: #Twitter Reactions + context] EVERYTHING you need to know about the #NataliePortman and #Moby situation. Portman has denied dating Moby in her teens, calling the musician's behaviour "inappropriate".
The actress was responding to Moby's new memoir, in which he claims Portman asked him out after a show in 2001.
"I was a bald binge drinker and Natalie Portman was a beautiful movie star. But here she was in my dressing room, flirting with me," he wrote.
But Portman said the description was inaccurate, calling Moby a "creep" who overstepped his bounds.
She said: "I was a fan and went to one of his shows when I had just graduated. He was on tour and I was working shooting a film, so we only hung out a handful of times before I realised that this was an older man who was interested in me in a way that felt inappropriate."
Moby responded on Instagram , insisting the pair did date and stayed friends for years.
The book is not the first time Moby has spoken about dating Portman. In 2008, he told Spin magazine they shared a "very brief affair" that made him the target of "nerd wrath".
"You can't date Luke Skywalker's mom and not have them hate your guts," he said, referring to Portman's role in the Star Wars prequels.
In his autobiography, the musician - who sold millions of copies of his 1999 album Play - describes attending the MTV Awards with the actress, and later visiting her while she attended Harvard in Boston.
"I took a taxi to Cambridge to meet Natalie. We held hands and wandered around Harvard, kissing under the centuries-old oak trees. At midnight she brought me to her dorm room and we lay down next to each other on her small bed. After she fell asleep I carefully extracted myself from her arms and took a taxi back to my hotel."
But Portman, who has become one of the leading figures in the #TimesUp and #metoo movements, said the book contained several "factual errors and inventions.‚Äù

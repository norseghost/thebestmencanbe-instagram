Not every fitness journey is about losing a ton of weight or building muscle. I take pride in the journey of being comfortable in my own skin-regardless of what the scale reads. My fitness journey has helped me learn so much about myself, inside and out, and thatâ€™s what keeps me determined. Without a strong mind your body will be weak.

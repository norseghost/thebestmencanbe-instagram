I left this out in the description but he told me earlier that he typically goes for women he finds physically attractive but don’t have much to offer personality wise, something he claimed he was trying to change... by ignoring a woman who wanted to meet him before sleeping with him... by getting angry that a stranger wouldn’t send nudes... yeah ok Brett big mystery why you’re single 🙄 there is nothing wrong with having casual sex - however, there is no SAFE way to do that without MEETING someone first. Ghosting someone for wanting that is insane. Also I guess this is me officially coming out for my #metoo moment 🤷‍♀️

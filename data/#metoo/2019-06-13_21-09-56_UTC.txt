And I'm like, "You go girl!" (Martin voice). That transformation is real!  The Word of God is too powerful to not change you, once you pick it up and decide to read it.  2 Timothy 3:16 "All scripture is breathed out by God and profitable (useful) for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for good work." Throughly equipped for good work.  That part! üíØ  For either the Word will keep you from sin, or sin will keep you from the Word.  The more you read it, the more you will walk in God's truth rather than your own.  As you begin to transform spiritually on the inside, that power will start manifest itself on the outside.  That's the part when your Family & friends start to see how much you've changed.  You might even be told by those who don't understand, "You think you're better than us!" That's what happened with me.  I didn't just oneday decide to stop going to the clubs every weekend or stop having sex oneday on my own power.  But rather my love for sin left me.  I'd soon receive confirmation about what God was doing in me the more I read the Bible.  God's plans, truths, prophecies, revelations, and wisdom all in this one book.  Glory to God!  So ladies, this post is for you.  I want this to encourage you to read your Bible.  Learn it like you learn the words of that new song by Beyonc√©, apply it to your life like you apply the foundation of your makeup, and take it with you everywhere you go like you do your pocketbook.  You will see love from the lenses of the one who created it, and you will no longer mistaken lust when you see how Jesus loves you.

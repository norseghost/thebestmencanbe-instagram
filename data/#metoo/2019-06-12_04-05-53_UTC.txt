“...Chetana has witnessed hundreds and hundreds of people choose to transform their lives from what she calls ‘trauma-affected to trauma-released.” “This rolling experience confirms that the world is full of people sharing the same intention: to live free, peaceful, happier, and more fulfilled lives.” About two months ago I was brought to my knees with the effects of my traumas. I took an emergency leave of absence from work for a week, bought this book and started working with a breathwork therapist. It has changed my life. 
After over a decade in therapy, reading countless books and trying everything from Reiki to nutritional coaching (which I still love and use!); I still had sometimes severe and very real symptoms of trauma. I couldn’t understand it. 
My symptoms included anxiety, dissociation, mood swings, fear of intimacy, depression, poor eating habits, flashbacks and body triggers just to name some.

Trauma is stored in the body and requires bodywork in order to release it fully. So even though I had worked out and through so much of my trauma; the body triggers were still intact.

I cannot say enough about how much just a few chapters of this book and a few sessions with my breathworker has impacted my life so far. 
Please reach out to me if you are at all curious or have any questions; I’m more than happy to share my experience and any resources I can to help you on your journey to healing 🙏🏻💜😌 I still have a long way to go, but we are each worth having a free, peaceful, happy and fulfilled life ❤️ @biodynamicbreathwork •

i’m honestly so sad. it wasn’t healthy when i pushed it away and when it came back it would be a million times worse than it is now. but i feel like i’m just caught in a constant depression. and i don’t know what to do about it. i feel like there’s nothing i can do about it. i’m just constantly so sad. no matter how much i want to forget i can’t forget about what happened. and i’m so sad. i want it to be over but i don’t think it will ever be. and i don’t want it to start to affect my relationships with other people. i know i’m trying to recover from this but i’m starting to think that there’s no true recovery. i think no matter what this will always haunt me. and affect me. i just want to stop feeling like this. i want it to be over.

I get the most direct questions on social media, and you would think by now I would be used to it. Not really. Some questions still shock me. 
I recently worked on a campaign to Japan. I was asked on numerous occasions "how did you get that gig?" on Instastories.

I would understand if you and I are close friends and you're asking "Can I pick your brains?" I always cringe when people ask me this... or how much money do you make a year? That is quite private, don't you think?

I now refer these inquiries to my YouTube TEDx talk which shows the long path my journey has taken. I also have written numerous articles on many publications regarding #howto. 
My interview with @launchmetrics will provide additional #howto, on dealing or working with influencers and PR agencies that might contact you. 
The interview also applies to everyday life and Instagram. People forget that behind the IG screen, there is a real person ðŸ˜‰

Shocker. \nApologies to my family who have the joy of reading this post and to the young girls on my insta - You can stop reading here. \nThis one goes out to select few of my guy friends that have chosen to support rape culture through direct action or inaction. \nI was naive enough to think that it wouldn\u2019t happen to me. That I wouldn\u2019t be sexually assaulted or harassed. Spoiler alert. It\u2019s happened twice. When reality is I can count the number of women I know that haven\u2019t been on one hand. And you stand there and tell me because you don\u2019t do that you\u2019re not part of the problem. Well here\u2019s a reality check. \nTo my close guy friend, I told you about what happened to me. I opened up and I cried. You sent back a pizza recipe and a \u201chey, I don\u2019t want that kind imagery\u201d. Thank you. That really helped. \nTo the guys I told about their friend trying to abuse me, all you had to say was \u201coh you have to remember how he was brought up.\u201d \u201cYou should reconsider what guys you for\u201d. You made excuse after excuse for why my story was invalid. \nThank you. That really helped. \nTo the guys who\u2019ve abused me over social media because \u201cyou look like the kind of girl that puts out, why don\u2019t you put out for me\u201d. When I ask what makes you think this is okay and you respond with \u201cwell I\u2019m not physically touching you so it\u2019s not harassment. What are you going to do?\u201d I\u2019m lucky enough that I haven\u2019t let my experiences break me, that they no longer hurt me, that they don\u2019t define me. But if you\u2019re one of my guy friends, can you do me a favour? Can you stop supporting this kind of culture. I know it\u2019s not \u201call men\u201d."

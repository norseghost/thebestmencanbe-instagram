“The tattoo was made for and dedicated to sexual assault survivors. It is a unity symbol inspired by the loops of our DNA structure and our universal infinity sign. It combines inspiration from Lady Gaga's favorite flower, the white rose, to breathe life into an organic and growing symbol. The final image embraces a fiery shape to give us power and strength everywhere we go.” — from the creator of the design #metoo #girlswithtattoos

@stephrosetattoos thank you for taking my vision and making it an absolute dream. Every day I look down and am reminded of why I’m still fighting ❤️

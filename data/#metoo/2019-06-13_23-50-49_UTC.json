                        "text": "\u2728Earth & Body Safe Menstrual Products\u2728\nHere\u2019s the tea my friends: many menstrual products like tampons and pads have been found to have hormone-disrupting and other harmful chemicals, and we\u2019re putting them in or against our vulvas/vaginas/reproductive organs! And not only are they potentially doing damage to our bodies, they\u2019re definitely doing damage to the earth! \u201cSanitary napkins\u201d take 500-800 years to break down and each one of us is putting 200-300 pounds of them in the landfill in our lifetimes. And to top it off, that many pads/tampons is mighty expensive! .\nI did a little post on my story a few days ago asking you all what menstrual products you use (to see the responses go to the periods highlight), and most people were using a combination between a menstrual cup and free bleeding/period panties. Which is rad! But for those of who are thinking whAt? WhY? Here are some answers. . \u2728Menstrual Cups\u2728\nThe funny looking little purple thing on the right is a menstrual cup by @lunettecup. Cups come in different shapes and sizes depending on your vagina depth and flow. They can be left in for up to 12 hours (given they don\u2019t fill up earlier - that\u2019s dependent on your flow) and simply collect the blood as it falls. When you take it out (with clean hands) you empty it, give it a rinse and reinsert it. The part people often find the most challenging about menstrual cups is getting them in, it can definitely be a challenge at first. The good side is they are made of body safe material (woo no carcinogens!), last a long time (~10 years), reduce waste, and save you heaps of money long term. \u2728Reusable Pads\u2728\nThis is my newest purchase, the little floral cotton pad by @hannahpad_australia. I used to think that reusable pads sounded icky, but let\u2019s be real: you wash and rewear that one shirt you wear to the gym all the time. So why can\u2019t you do that with your pads! I always worried about them becoming discolored (which is a lol since I just bleed into my underwear anyways) but if they do, then so be it. ~it\u2019s just blood~ To hell with the shame and perceived grossness of period blood. \nSo there you have it, better for you, better for mama earth. \ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udf0f"

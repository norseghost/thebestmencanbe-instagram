Your strength is unmatched. You have survived what other's have been through and couldn't defeat. Even in moments of weakness you display strength. Tears, saying no, frustration and sometimes saying I'm not okay is displaying strength. You recognize you're off balance and you aren't ashamed to say it because the next step is making choices to help yourself. You are beautiful and strong and your internal work doesn't go unnoticed.

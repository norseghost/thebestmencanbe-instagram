Happy Father’s Day to all of the dads out there.
And, as always, we would like to encourage those who may not have your dad in your life for whatever reason to create memories with the people whom you’ve chosen to journey with you. We have often heard people say you don’t get to choose your family, but the truth is, you can! #childsexabuseawareness #stopchildsexabuse #childsexabusesurvivor #parentsofchilldsexabusesurvivor #sexualassault #endchildsexabuse #endrapeculture #childabuse #sextrafficking #atlanta #ATL #Georgia #church #girls #teens #awareness #rapevictim #victim #children #prevention #trafficking  #survivor #tips #blogger #speaker #metoo #advocate #volunteer  #socialmedia

June is #ptsdawareness month but for me every month is that since I was diagnosed with PTSD. 
PTSD is not a visible illness, please do not tell me â€˜well it will get betterâ€™ as it is a bit complex. Treatment for my PTSD has had its high points and also had me crying in my therapist office.
Please remember youâ€™re not alone in your fight. If you ever wanna vent or need someone to talk to my DMs are open and Iâ€™ll try to respond as quickly as I canðŸ’–. #ptsd #depression #metoo #trauma #traumarecovery #realrecovery #recovery #ptsdwarrior #ptsdsurvivor #ptsdrecovery #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #tbi #anxiety #believesurvivors

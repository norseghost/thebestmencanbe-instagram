Sooo our brilliant, beautiful soul, 14 year old daughter told me yesterday she is being cat called in the halls in between classes, being looked up and down constantly- they make sure it makes her feel uncomfortable, get txts from the little pigs asking her for nude photos and saying gross shit to her. I'm absolutely livid.... Like for fucks sakes teach your kids some god dam respect. I know this is not an isolated incident and it's getting worse. Talk to your kids, find out if they are ok? Sexual harassment is not just a phase, it's dangerous behavior and needs to be corrected immediately!!!!

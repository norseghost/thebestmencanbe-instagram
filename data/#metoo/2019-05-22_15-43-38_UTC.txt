Today is an exciting day for us at Trees of Hope as we just finished our Nobleman curriculum! After @anisamellinger finishes the editing this week, we are off to the press! We also finalized our cohost for all our online videos that will be coming out Fall 2019. We are so proud of the courages teens who will walk through this study to find healing.

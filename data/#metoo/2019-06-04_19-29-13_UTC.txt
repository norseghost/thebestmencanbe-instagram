As some of you may know already, I’ve been in the hospital for almost two weeks now. I had a major setback where I felt afraid for my own safety, so I went to the emergency room and the doctors recommended me to stay in the hospital for a while. Now I have been given an additional antidepressant medication, that’s actually working fantastically. I feel slightly tired, and I struggle to feel happiness sometimes, but almost all of my suicidal thoughts are gone. All I can do now is hope the medication continues on working and stabilises in a good way. I want to thank you all so so much for your support! It means the world to me. You’re such beautiful people. ❤️❤️❤️

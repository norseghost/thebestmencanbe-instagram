                        "text": "Washington Post: The Crusading Bloggers Exposing Abuse in Protestant Churches\n*\n*\n\"During the fall of 2017, along with the rest of the country, Jules Woodson watched the Me Too movement play out in the media. As women came forward to expose the predatory behavior they\u2019d survived, the Colorado Springs-based flight attendant reflected on a night in 1998, when Andy Savage, the youth pastor at her local church in her hometown of The Woodlands, Tex., offered her a ride home. At some point, Woodson says, Savage passed the turn to her home and drove down a dirt road, where he reached a dead end and switched off the headlights. He unzipped his jeans and asked Woodson, then 17, to perform oral sex. A few minutes later, she says, Savage jumped from the truck, fell to his knees and told Woodson she must take what happened to the grave.\n*\n*\nThe next day, terrified and traumatized, Woodson told the church\u2019s assistant pastor what happened; she says he asked if she\u2019d \u201cparticipated.\u201d While Savage continued as youth pastor \u2014 even leading a True Love Waits event encouraging youth to abstain from all physical contact, not just from sex \u2014 Woodson sank into shame and a deep depression. Although she retained her faith, she eventually left the church.\n*\n*\nTwenty years later, Woodson found Savage\u2019s email and sent him a note with the subject line: \u201cDo you remember?\u201d She asked if he recalled the night he was supposed to drive her home \u2014 \u201cand instead drove me to a deserted back road and sexually assaulted me?\u201d She signed off with \u201c#metoo.\u201d\n*\n*\nWhen Woodson Googled his name, along with \u201csex abuse in church\u201d and \u201cyouth pastor sex abuse,\u201d she found a blog dedicated to Christian survivor stories called the\u00a0Wartburg Watch; there, she read a post about an alleged abuse coverup at a church affiliated with Savage\u2019s current church. About a month later, Woodson submitted her own first-person account about her abuse to the Wartburg Watch and a similar Christian survivor blog called\u00a0Watch Keep."

i’ve been having a really hard time falling asleep at night. every time i close my eyes to sleep it just keeps flashing through my mind and i can’t shut it out. i don’t know how to make it stop. my brain just won’t stop running. i can’t stop thinking. and i just feel so empty inside. and it hurts. i’m so exhausted. how am i supposed to deal with this? originally when i was trying to just push it out of my mind it would still happen but now that i’m actively trying to deal with this and digging everything up it’s been happening just about every night. how do i make it stop? how do i stop reliving it? i have to keep myself busy and distracted or my mind will completely give in to the torture.

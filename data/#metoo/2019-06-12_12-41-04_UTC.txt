I think this article provides a balanced approach to the overcautiousness of men post #metoo While a lot of the accusations stemming from actual assaults might count in the millions, that is still only a very small fraction of the general population, unlike the claims of the #metoo movement which claims “every woman you know...” As a result, and quite unfairly yet understandably, a lot of men will avoid interactions beyond the absolutely necessary with women, thus a large number of women will have to suffer in the workforce. This is not about being creepy. As a side note, I have nothing against AOC despite her blunders as a freshman politician...

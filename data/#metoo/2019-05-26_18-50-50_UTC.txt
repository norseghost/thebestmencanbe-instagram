Our society never fails to disappoint me!

RAPE is the biggest fear of every women in the world. Every single minute a women is being harassed, raped, tortured, ripped and stripped.
Be it a 2 day old or a 20 year old or an 50 year old women have always been physically and mentally harassed and tortured.

A women is not only raped physically but also mentally. The rapist is not only the one at fault, we as a society are at fault.

AS A SOCIETY WE DO PLACE SUCH QUESTIONS BY WHICH WE MENTALLY HARASS THE VICTIM

ğŸ”ºIf dressing was the issue was that 2 days old child raped because she wasn't wearing anything or was it the fault of the kurta with jeans.. Oh may be the burqa was quite fitted ğŸ”ºNO dignified women would ever want attention in such a way... Please clean your brain with acid!!!
ğŸ”ºOH Really!! What was her fault that she trusted trash men like you...
ğŸ”ºHer torn clothes, scratches on her body, her wounded body and broken soul with teary eyes..

🗝I heard a wise woman say the other day that abuse requires mirrored toxicity. (Shout out @drdenamichele )!🗝
..
It got me thinking about how I used to think I was the crazy one because sometimes, I would go completely off the chain in reaction to the things my abuser said and did.
..
In those moments I truly felt like I couldn’t control myself; like this dark, ominous entity called toxicity was trying to eat away my soul and I was powerless to stop it.
..
I questioned myself often, wondering if I was maybe mentally ill or incapable of proper mindsets to really live life correctly...I felt stuck, wondering if I was just damaged goods.
..
Honestly, when you’re in an abusive situation, oftentimes you will mirror the toxicity of your abuser - this comes out as a defense mechanism in response to the levels two and three stress hormones you are experiencing when someone mistreats you.
..
You’re not crazy, but if you’re not aware of what is happening, you may become the very thing you are battling against. This will make you feel crazy - because you didn’t start out like that, and when the abuse isn’t present, you know you’re a different person. ..
The good news is that it’s not a mental illness to respond to toxicity with toxicity - it’s an improper response that can be unlearned with a little daily focused thinking and a lot of determination to rise above and take control of your emotions. ..
Just choose to respond to toxicity differently. You can do it! ❤️🤗👑

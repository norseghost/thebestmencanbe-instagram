Do you feel like you\u2019re struggling to get through the day? You\u2019re not alone. I've felt and been through it all.\n\nThe journey of spiritual healing began in 2016 when facing several life circumstances head on and began to witness how life was being directed from places of abuse: emotional, physical and mental including substance abuse. After recieving a very powerful wake up call from struggling with PTSD, eating disorders, physical and substance abuse and the many challenges that correlated with them. As these challenges were becoming increasingly loud, I came very close to ending it all. After reaching out to a colleague in the field, I was introduced to Sacred Journey Therapy, Energy Healing facilitated through Cranial Sacral Therapy. \nI fell in love with the work and enrolled at The Sacred Journey Institute located in Illinois. Soon after, throughout this training I anchored in how changing my life meant living from the present and not the past. Not only was I able to lift myself out of a very dark time, I created an illuminated shift from deeply buried patterning and cycles that contribute to keeping an individual locked into pains and suffering. Sometimes very harsh circumstances. \nAfter looking fear and evil in the face, I have immense gratitude for what it has given me in return. The opportunity to help others and cherish my spiritual gifts  is an incredible blessing. \nLife is sweet. Live fearlessly. Love unconditionally.\n\n#ascension #sacredfeminine #facilitator #indigo #manifestor #goldencolorado #remotehealing #ancestralhealing #miasmrelease #selfcare #selflove #massagetherapy #reiki  #holisticcare #craniosacral  #sobriety #mentalhealth  #truama #addiction #ptsd #spirituality  #metaphysical  #graditude #sacredjourney #surrender #balance #harmonry #wewillnotbesilent #metoo #namaste"

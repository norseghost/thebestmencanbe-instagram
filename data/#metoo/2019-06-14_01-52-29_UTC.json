                        "text": "Throughout the committee hearing, several Republican senators including Ted Cruz and Thom Tillis pointed to the Obama campaign\u2019s use of Facebook data, to highlight the fact that such practices are bipartisan.\n\nHowever, people who downloaded the Obama campaign app were aware they were using a political app. By contrast, the data obtained by Cambridge Analytica was obtained via a personality quiz application whose users had no idea their data would be used by a political campaign.\n\nCambridge Analytica improperly obtained the personal information of millions of Facebook users to build profiles of US voters in order to target them with personalised political advertisements, via a related UK-based entity called SCL Elections.\n.\n- We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people\u2019s profiles, said Wylie in March. - And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\n\nWylie has previously told MPs at a British select committee that the EU referendum was won through fraud after Vote Leave allegedly used a network of companies to get round election spending laws. He said he thought there \u201ccould have been a different outcome had there not been, in my view, cheating\u201d. He also met privately with House Democrats in April, but Wednesday\u2019s hearing was his first public appearance before US lawmakers.\n\nOlivia Solon\nThe Guardian\n\n#marketing #trending #profit #political #success #collective #ootd #politics #trending #metoo #timesup #trend #strategy #feminism #finnishgirl #freedom #graphics #future #lifestyle #journalist #journalism #psychology #god #fashion #trendy #hygge #blogger #influencer #business #lgbt #concept"

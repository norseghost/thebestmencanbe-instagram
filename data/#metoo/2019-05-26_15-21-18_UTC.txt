I never thought I’d hear myself say I was ready to leave Los Angeles, yet here I am. But that’s how life is, isn’t it? It is the adventures we don’t plan on that are the most rewarding. LA wasn’t an adventure I planned on, yet I have loved and lived in this city for almost 6 years now. It has changed me for the better. In truth, we rarely see people leaving this city victorious. We think people leave LA because they failed at their dreams, which may or may not be true at all. In some sense I suppose I did fail: I am neither famous nor making money from my music. But as I saw more and more of the inner workings of the industry over the years, I loved it less. I loved music less. At times, I loved myself less. Then over the last year and a half especially, I learned that I don’t have to wait to be famous or rich to make an impact. I learned that my story matters now, and that my art is a strong platform from which to speak out against social injustice. I saw myself rise from the ashes, and chart a new course. I am so thankful for this experience of living in LA, and I am also so thankful that I get to leave. My task here is done, and I can now carry all I have learned here into grad school, back home to Minnesota, and ever onward on this new adventure. #twomonthsleft

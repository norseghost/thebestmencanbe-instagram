Part one of two-I’ve always been hesitant to share the truly hard moments of my life. I don’t want to trigger anyone or sound like I’m complaining or looking for attention. But maybe by sharing mine I can encourage you to overcome yours.

If you looked at my childhood it would seem pretty ideal, but in truth my younger years were riddled with sexual abuse, at first I was too young to even understand what was happening to me. I didn’t get help until I was halfway through my teens & the trauma of it all had settled in deep. I’m lucky to have a loving family that was good to me even when they didn’t know what was happening, & once they found out they did everything possible to help me. I think my family, horses & nature are the only reasons I’m alive today.

Sometimes I wonder how much that trauma shaped me. Would I not deal with anxiety, maybe feel like I was pretty enough or not too damaged or emotional, or maybe I would just have a whole different set of issues if sexual abuse wasn’t my first trauma it could have easily been something else.

Luna has offered me everyday healing since I first brought her home, she’s given me a reason to go outside when I feel like I can’t get out of bed & is always ready to cuddle or play. Mountains are healing, I’ve summited Mt Rainier 4 times now & spent many solo nights in the backcountry. Whenever I don’t feel capable of something I can remember how challenging some of those moments were & know I’m much stronger than whatever is currently overwhelming me. Time helps too, years of gradual growth, understanding & distance to see that life goes on. Healing is a unique & patient process but I do believe it exists for everyone & every trauma. #metoo

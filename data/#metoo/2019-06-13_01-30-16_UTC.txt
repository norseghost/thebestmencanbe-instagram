Projection! My ex mind fucked me so bad that he convinced me that I had an affair on him years ago. He would confront me over and over for hours and hours, not letting me sleep, eat, shower. When I told him I didn’t cheat on him, the hitting was worse, the bruises on my body became more apparent, the pulling out my hair (why always the hair?!) and then eventually came the concussions, black eye and swollen lips. I finally just admitted I did cheat so that the hitting would stop. Do you think it did? Nope. The abuse was still there but now I was a cheater. Want to know what I eventually found out? I didn’t cheat AT ALL and yet he did. You know how hard that is to overcome? When someone convinces you of something that you didn’t do and then come to find out it was manipulation, abuse and threats that made you change your mind. How fucked is that? #narcissism #narcissist #narcissisticabuse #domesticviolence #domesticviolencesurvivor #domesticviolenceawareness #domesticabuse #domesticabusesurvivor #domesticabuseawareness #machiavellianism #divorce #divorced #singleparent #singlemom #mentalabuse #physicalabuse #emotionabuse #spiritualabuse #sexualabuse #metoo

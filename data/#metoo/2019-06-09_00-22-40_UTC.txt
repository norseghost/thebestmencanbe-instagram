On Sunday June 9, Moonlight Tattoo will be participating in the @stillnotaskingforit_flashevent ® ! 12-8 pm, first come first served, flash designs from $100-$200. All profits will be donated to the King County Sexual Assault Resource Center ( https://www.kcsarc.org/ )
There will be a raffle as well, so if you don’t want to get tattooed you can still come out and donate and win cool stuff! DESIGNS WILL BE POSTED THE DAY OF THE EVENT. We would prefer that the placement of tattoos is limited to arms, legs, shoulders (no ribs, stomachs,hands, or necks) to ensure that we can fit as many people in as possible.
See y’all there!!! ❤️✌🏻💋 #stillnotaskingforit2019 #stillnotaskingforit #metoo #survivors #womensrights

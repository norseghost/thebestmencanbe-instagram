It’s Caturday and I figured I’d start the morning with coffee and a cat pun. The suns shining, birds are chirping and it’s 70 degrees. I have a @toledowalleye game tonight so I hope everyone has a beautiful Caturday 💖🐱☀️ #healingvibes #realrecovery #cats #catsofinstagram #caturday #caturdaymorning #caturdaycuties #ptsd #ptsdsurvivor #ptsdawareness #ptsdrecovery #mentalhealth #mentalillness #anxiety #anxietysupport #selflove #selfcare #lovemyself #puns #metoo #shepersisted

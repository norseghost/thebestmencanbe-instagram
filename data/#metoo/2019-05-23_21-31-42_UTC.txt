What a great day! 
I shared The ‘AND’ Series to Watsonville High School art classes and lead a mini art salon. 
I presented the artwork and invited them to journal their ideas for positive change in today’s world, and then share them anonymously. 
I was touched by their thoughtful insights and personal stories.  It’s such a privilege to hear what is in the hearts and minds of young people. 
A big thank you to Sara Webb for inviting me to be a guest artist! - the WHS art students are lucky to have you as their art teacher!

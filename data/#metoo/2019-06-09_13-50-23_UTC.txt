Love Imperfect People. You’re one of them.
✨
The #CHASE for perfection often makes us lose perspective on the things that actually matter. And I’ve found that it doesn’t exist this side of eternity. Often times people can judge us based on what we have, where we live, and how we look. And I’m so grateful my mentors at  @mosaic never gave up on me.
✨
Truth be told, I use to like the idea of people thinking I had my “shizzle” all together.  Now, I love telling everyone how much of a mess I was, and show them what the power of the Almighty can do. ✨
In the words of my pastor @erwinmcmanus , “We fight for humans. We fight for the human heart 💔. If we are going to represent Jesus well in this culture, we need to be looking for the one that no one is looking for. “ I’m so grateful I wasn’t overlooked, and that I get to do life with the @mosaicsouthpasadena family. 🕊 📹: @simplyfreshsanmarino

Another VICTORIOUS review!📖
”This book was an absolute page turner because the stories are real, truthful, emotional, and empowering. Victoria has completely let her walls down and is telling her story to the world. She is being brave, courageous, bold, and honest, hoping that someone can take her life's story and grow from it. 1 in 3 women are going through or have gone through some type of abuse in their lifetime; this book reaches out to those who feel alone or ashamed. I finished this book all in one sitting and can't wait to lend it to someone who needs it.”

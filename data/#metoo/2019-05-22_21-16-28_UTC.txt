I understand now why any argument sends me into a panic crazy mood. 
I understand that it stems from my insecurities around experiences I had no control over. Be it from rape, physical abuse, emotional abuse, gas lighting etc... which led me to question myself. Not trust myself cuz I didnâ€™t get myself out of the experiences. I left myself in bad places and I blame myself for leaving myself in them bad places.... so if I see anything even a little close to them bad experiences I get panic crazy and run. I try to leave cuz I donâ€™t trust myself to recognize a bad situation.

Stop blaming the girls and educate the boys! 
Then, I had an abuse marriage. Filled with gas lighting and lies. He choked me while I was holding my baby and denies it ever happened. Also punched a hole in the wall where my head was seconds before. He blamed all his anger on me. His cheating was my fault too ðŸ™„ but I stayed for 10 years. Iâ€™m happily divorced now. Iâ€™m so happy to be a single mum. My daughter said something to me that just made it all click. She said â€˜mum, if your not happy with dad. Leaveâ€™ so innocently. In her toddler voice... basically a Boston accent ðŸ˜… and she was my catalyst to a better

And You wanna have your mind REALLY, REALLY blown???? 💥 Read the caption and comments from @traumaandco ❤️
>> i remember one year in school i used to get a man stop every day in his car to chat with me as i was waiting alone at the bus stop. his car was light blue and he must have been about 45ish. he was slowly trying to make me feel comfortable with him. luckily i told my step dad about it one day and he came out one morning and had words. and this area i lived in was the nice part of my town as we had moved into my grannies house. So fked up. (not my earliest experience) 😷😷😷

The Sweetener Tour was amazing. Loved the music, the dances, and all the artists. One thing I really admired throughout the show was that Ariana gave every artist their own time. The guitarist and her solo was amazing, and I really need to search up her name on YouTube or something. The dancers were also incredibly talented and overall this show really offered a break from my usually bleak attitude. Also, despite the fact that May is over and it is now June, Mental Health should still be something talked about. Every month is mental health month.

Thank you @carole826_ for the amazing day! ðŸ¥°

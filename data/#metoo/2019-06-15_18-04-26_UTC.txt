MY PROFILE PHOTO IS NOT BLUE BECAUSE OF A SOCIAL MEDIA TREND. THERE IS NO DENYING THE SUCCESS OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN SPREADING AWARENESS (ARAB SPRINGS, #METOO, ETC.). HOWEVER OUR ACTIVISM ON SOCIAL MEDIA SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A MORE PROFOUND SENSE OF CARE AND RESPONSIBILITY. SO ALONG WITH CHANGING YOUR PHOTOS PERHAPS LOOK INTO SOME ORGANISATIONS THAT ALLOW YOU GET MORE CONNECTED WITH THE SITUATION ON GROUND. ALSO YOU COULD JUST TEXT YOUR SUDANESE FRIENDS. MAKE SURE THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE OKAY. THIS WAY, MAYBE THIS HASHTAG DOESNT DIE AFTER THREE OR FOUR DAYS.

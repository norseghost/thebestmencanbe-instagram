Intimacy on set - choreographing sex scenes
â €
When it comes to performing stunts- there is a stunt coordinator, who makes sure no one gets physically hurt. What about the mental damage? Imagine filming a rape scene?
â €
Few takeaways from writer-actor-director Terry McMahon and intimacy coordinator-movement director Ita O'Brien that I got:
â €
â€¢	Agree on level of nudity, discuss and rehearse the scene prior to shoot. Sign those forms.
â €
â€¢	Speak with each actor in private first, to establish their boundaries. Check past trauma to make sure it doesn't get triggered. Know that consent can change from yes to no and another way around at the rehearsals or on set.
â €
â€¢	No objectifying. Use proper language to describe body parts, movements etc.
â €
â€¢	Agree physical touch. At rehearsals make sure each body part that is being touched/kissed is discussed and agreed upon.
â €
â€¢	Have a timeout sign which actors can use to stop the scene if at any time they feel uncomfortable.
â €
â€¢	Ask actors not to involve any emotions at the rehearsals stage. Use it purely for blocking. This will ensure that actors don't give "their all" to a performance before camera can capture it.
â €
â€¢	It should be a closed set for the whole duration of the shoot for the intimate scene (and not just for the takes). Phones and monitors are to be switched off, only those who absolutely need to be there present.
â €
â€¢	Schedule intimate scenes for the morning and discuss hygiene, make sure actors come in showered.
â €
â€¢	Get actors to try on bits of intimate wardrobe (like genital covers) before the shoot to make sure they fit.
â €
â€¢	Nudity is only from "action" to "cut" - get actors covered straight away after the "cut" and keep them covered until just before "action".
â €
â€¢	And finally, have actors do some movement routine to get out of the character and back into their own selves after the shoot.

Ok, here it is, I hope you find it useful. More on that on www.liminicreative.com/blog

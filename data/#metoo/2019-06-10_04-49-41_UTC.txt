So happy to have participated in this years Still Not Asking for It tattoo event. Now is such a critical period of time for womenâ€™s rights as we see some states taking giant leaps backwards. Rosie the Riveter has always been a symbol of female empowerment and my go to Halloween costume! As a survivor of sexual assault it was amazing to be tattooed in solidarity with people around the globe! Super happy with how it turned out!!

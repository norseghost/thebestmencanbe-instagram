We are still accepting applicants! Our first round of participants have been notified. Have you applied to take part in this dynamic program lead by V.O.I.C.E @asurvivorsvoice I am so excited about this project!!! All should know by now that my faith was a extremely important part of my healing process. In thinking about my process I realized that people of many different faiths are affected by sexual violence. They too have stories of triumph and stories of how their faith failed them. I also know that people of color stories are not told. I want to change that through this special interfaith project entitled “No Matter The Faith”. If you are a person of color, faith and are willing to share your story apply today to be apart of this amazing project! We want to hear from you and show the world that your story matters and how faith can either help or hurt your healing process!!!!

David Tennant at #March4Women supporting the call to end #workplaceharassment.

For the past few years, CARE & our incredible supporters have been campaigning for women everywhere to be protected from violence and harassment at work. Next week, at the International Labour Organisation Conference, there is a global opportunity to act. We are calling on the #UKGovernment to ensure a strong and inclusive global law is agreed to protect workers everywhere. .

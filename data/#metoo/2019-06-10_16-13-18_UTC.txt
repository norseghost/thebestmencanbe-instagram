Earlier today Jack Straw and Justice for Lai Dai Han delivered a letter to 10 Downing Street to ask for the UK government to support an independent UN-led investigation into sexual violence during the Vietnam War.

Tomorrow, 'Mother and Child', a memorial sculpture in honour of all victims of sexual violence around the world, commissioned by the Justice for Lai Dai Han campaign, will be unveiled. 
The sculpture will be unveiled by Nadia Murad, the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize winner, at Church House, Westminster. ðŸ‘‰http://bit.ly/jldhevent

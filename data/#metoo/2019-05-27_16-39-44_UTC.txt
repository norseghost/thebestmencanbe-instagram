So many times in my life I have wanted to have a bonafide re-do. I have looked back time and time again and wondered, "If I could have just changed one thing, would everything would be different? Would I even be alive? Would I be worse off?" My marriage is one of those things. No matter how many times I've said that I could have lived without that experience, my partner reminds me that it's simply not true. I am a different woman, I have experienced a lot and I needed to go through every single thing I went through because of where I am right now. And that's true, 100%. And the same goes for you.*

When we look at life this way, we relieve ourselves of the burden of victimization, don't we? It's important that we remember that we actively participated in the creation and the subsequent suffering we put ourselves through when the relationship broke down. For me, I was terrified of being a single mom, so it was easier for me to put the burden of our family circumstances on him, but the truth is that I didn't have to be so scared. But I went there in my head and I stayed there for way too long. I created a narrative and I got stuck in that. And I just released this the other day. Talk about holding onto an idea, thinking you're right the entire time. I wouldn't say I was wrong, but I no longer need to be right. *

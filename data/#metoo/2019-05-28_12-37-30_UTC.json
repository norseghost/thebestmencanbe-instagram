Think a little more however & the logic becomes clearer, Aladdin tells the story of a \u201cpetty thief/street-rat\u201d who lives in the doldrums, ducking & diving to survive amongst thieves & pursued by inept guards, put like that & it could almost have been tailor made for Ritchie\u2019s directorial leanings! \nOf course this being a Disney production much of the director\u2019s unique style is lost bar some fleeting slow-mo, speed up shots & a breakneck race through the markets of Agrabah, you see this is alive-action Aladdin very much in the mould of the #beautyandthebeast retelling, largely following the animated counterpart beat for beat, line for line with the exception of some very minor narrative tweaks & a beefed up part for Jasmine to keep with the empowerment of women that Disney has been (rightfully) championing for some years now, this Jasmine standing proudly along the likes of Elsa from Frozen in doing her part for the #metoo movement!\nOutside of Jasmine, writer #johnaugust (he behind many a Tim Burton film script) worked with Ritchie & give the villainous Jafar a more intriguing motive for his nasty ways, alas it counts for little when the actor cast (#marwankenzani) is far from"

i wish i was better confronting my emotions. i wish whenever i felt like i was about to cry i could just let it out and cry. whether i’m alone or with someone. i wish whenever something happens that reminded me of it i had the courage to let the person know. let someone know. i want to share my feelings so bad. have someone else to help me figure them out. i feel like that’s so much healthier than just trying to bottle it in all the time and pushing it from my mind. but i just can’t let them out. they stay trapped inside of me. i guess i just don’t want people to think i’m weak. i don’t want them to know how much it hurts. how much it affects me. i want to show that i’m strong. but i’m just not.

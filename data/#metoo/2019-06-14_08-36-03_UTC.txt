If we could just get more young role models like @arianagrande to step up and use what they earn for good, theyâ€™ll be able to convince people to start putting in some effort into making this country and other countries safer for everyone. Ariana went through a lot not long ago and she put herself out here like this, knowing sheâ€™ll get hate and attacks from pro-lifers. But, that obviously doesnâ€™t matter to her, as sheâ€™s standing up for what she believes in and what is right. Thank u Ariana! âœŠðŸ˜¤

THIS VICTIM TEACHER SAVED THE LIFE OF STUDENTS MANY TIMES IN SKV NO2 MAGAZINE ROAD SCHOOL, DELHI.
VICE PRINCIPAL REKHA BHATLA AND AFTERNOON BOYS SCHOOL PRINCIPAL DIDN'T TRY TO CLOSE ELECTRICITY BOXES,SOCKETS OUTSIDE & INSIDE CLASSROOMS SO OFENTLY STUDENTS GOT SHOCK OF ELECTRICITY CURRENT. AND MANY TIMES THIS VICTIM TEACHER SAVED STUDENTS FROM THAT ELECTRICITY SHOCK. WHEN STUDENTS WERE CRYING OF ELECTRICITY SHOCK THEN NO TEACHER/ STAFF WENT NEAR TO THEM BUT THIS BRAVE VICTIM TEACHER WENT TO NEAR THEM AND SAVED THEM WITH THE HELP OF WOODEN BLOCKS. BUT INSTEAD OF GIVING HER PRIZE / AWARD THE CORRUPT DIRECTOR AMIT SINGLA SUSPENDED VICTIM TEACHER FOR PROTECTING ACCUSED REKHA BHATLA & OTHER ACCUSED .
IT IS THE OLD WAY OF DELHI EDUCATION DEPARTMENT TO PUNISH HONEST VICTIM GIRL TEACHER AND TO GIVE AWARDS TO ACCUSED . 
WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SHAMEFUL WORK OF DIRECTOR AMIT SINGLA ?
WHO& WHEN WILL RESPONSIBLE MINISTERS WILL PUNISH CORRUPT DIRECTOR AMIT SINGLA, VICE PRINCIPAL REKHA BHATLA & OTHER ACCUSED?
HOW & WHY ALL ACCUSED HAVE BEEN HARRASSING VICTIM TEACHER TILL TODAY ? HOW & WHY CORRUPT DIRECTORS OFFICERS HAVE BEEN PROTECTING ALL ACCUSED TILL TODAY AND HARRASSING VICTIM GIRL TEACHER ?

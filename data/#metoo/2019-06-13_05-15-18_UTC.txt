In 2014 I was asked by my deisheetaan clan auntie to stand tall for my house (deishuhit) and join her in maintaining our communities voice in celebration, with permission from Emma Demmert and Jennie Jim together we kept our communities voice alive not with bitterness and spite but love.
We brought out the deishuhit love song never before heard at celebration.
I wore red boots with deer hooves (silent no more) to honor survivors of sexual abuse now our rights to choose is being attacked.
50%+ of those sexually abused are Alaskan Native Women, no one ever talks about the abuse of our men.
We had 6 weeks to prepare a whole new set most of the songs were deishuhit, everyone worked supper hard and it showed on stage, was an honor to represent my house along side my clan auntie Pauline, given that Emma gave me permission to use the dragonfly and because of my name I felt a duty to honor her final wishes as was everyone she gave them to.
Us two female drummers flanked our elder as she danced, such a powerful statement three women leading in.
We must stand tall in our truth if we are ever going to heal collectively.

My maternal line can be traced to one  woman which happens to be the interpretation of my traditional name.

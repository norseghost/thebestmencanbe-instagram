I nearly died from chronic malnutrition induced by depression; had a one-week long blackout, had to be dragged out of my dorm room.

Was emotionally exhausted from having to work with a student who sabotaged my experiments and tried to appropriate my work for his graduation.

#autism versus narcissism: I did not have the social skills to defend myself while he was very "charming"; had to save my lab results and protect my data relying only on myself.

It's #mentalhealthawarenessmonth

Shame on the existence, in medical school, of sexism, bullying, pervasive sexual harassment, poor work ethics and outright immorality. Shame on the stigma surrounding mental illness or even mental health care, such that even some health care practitioners are biased and adhere to outdated guidelines.
Shame on people who think it's alright to bully and take advantage of individuals with mental illnessess or disabilities.

Congratulations to myself for surviving through it all and obtaining both my medical degree and my MSc.

And all the best to all the future doctors and scientists who keep fighting to reach their goals! You are awesome and you can do it!

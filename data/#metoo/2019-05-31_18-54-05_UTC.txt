🥊 FIGHT ME 🥊 this #mentalhealthawareness month, I’ve been treating myself to more workout classes and it’s made me feel infinitely happier and more balanced. It’s time to just focus on myself and becoming stronger physically and emotionally ❤️

Newly obsessed with boxing and cycling 😍 @everybodyfights last night was amazing - founded by @georgeforeman3 // and @soulcycle with @mynameisclairejones // and @theclass with @cjfrogozo in NYC blows my mind, literally broke into tears and felt a whole weight lifted off my shoulders in class this week 😂🙏🏽

Here’s to investing more time into self-care moving forward!! 🦋

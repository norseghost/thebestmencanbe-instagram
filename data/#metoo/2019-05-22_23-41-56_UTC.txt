So I wrote this song awhile back for one of my arts classes, we had to create a piece of protest art. I chose to write mine about the #metoo movement, in the POV of someone who’s experienced sexual trauma. Now, my amazing and SUPER talented friend Zoe just choreographed a dance to my song and taught it to her friends and they learned it in like 20 mins and filmed it! It’s so cool to see people dancing to my song, thank you so much Zoe for doing this. I love you and want as many people as possible to see this! It deserves attention❤️ (PS THE REST OF OF THE VIDEO IS POSTED SEPARATELY TO SEE LOL I GOT CONFUSED)

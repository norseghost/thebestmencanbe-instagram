Dream Catching II The Legend Of the Dream Catcher. The Ojibwa (Chippewa) believe that night is full of both good and bad dreams. When a dream catcher is hung above the place where you sleep it moves freely in the night air and catches the dreams as they drift by. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Dream those dreams, catch the dreams that set your heart on fire, turn them into goals and then into realty. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

I like to close my eyes and picture this whenever I am feeling overwhelmed. I let myself feel the fingers wrapping around me, their warmth holding me secure and safe. The best part of this visualization is that this hand, the one protecting me, keeping me safe, is MY hand. I provide the safety, security and love and it is the most beautiful love ðŸ’›

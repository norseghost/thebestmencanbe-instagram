| No, it's not that time of the month |

Pre-menstrual syndrome refers to a collection of symptoms that occur before a woman gets her period. These symptoms include cramps, headaches, bloating, and moodiness. In popular culture, PMS is to blame any time a woman has any sort of emotions. Male characters joke, “Must be that time of the month,” whenever a woman reacts in a way that they find unacceptable or out of proportion.

Chocking up women’s emotional reactions to PMS is insulting and reductive. While many women do experience moodiness and mood swings when they are about to get their periods, not all feelings are because of a woman’s period. Blaming emotions on PMS is also dismissive in that it assumes that the woman’s emotions are invalid. Nine times out of ten when a man asks if it’s “That time of the month,” he was being awful and the woman’s reaction was totally justified.

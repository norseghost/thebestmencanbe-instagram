Week 21
Shout
By Laurie Halse Anderson 
Grades 9+

I fell for Laurie Halse Anderson years ago when I read Speak and she has never let me down. This beautiful memoir in verse is no exception. 
Halse Anderson takes us through her journey of writing SPEAK. She travels back to her less than idyllic childhood and revisits multiple times when she experienced sexual harassment and assault including the rape that inspired Speak. Halse Anderson also talks about her experiences after the Speak was published and the countless individuals, both female and male, who have confided in her their stories of assault and survival. 
Halse Anderson also shares some wonderful experiences from her youth that have also helped to shape the woman and author she is today. Despite the heavy subject matter, Shout does not leave you feeling hopeless. Instead, it is a story of strength, perseverance and the power of finding your voice.

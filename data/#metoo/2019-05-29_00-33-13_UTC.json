                        "text": "The great #KanyeWest #Drake beef has cooled off, but Kanye still treads lightly around the subject in his interview with David Letterman on My Next Guest Needs No Introduction. Per Pitchfork, West doesn\u2019t acknowledge the Toronto rapper by name, instead calling him \u201can artist which I will not mention because I\u2019m not allowed to mention him or any of his family members.\u201d When Letterman calls that description \u201cfairly provocative,\u201d Kanye explains, \u201cWell, we had a little beef last year.\u201d He then quotes a line from Drake\u2019s 2011 song \u201cCrew Love.\u201d The fraught frenemyship between Kanye and Drake reignited when Kanye scheduled the release of five albums in the middle of Drake\u2019s Scorpion rollout. (Other important chapters: Kanye denying that Pusha T learned about Drake\u2019s son from him, Drake reaching out to Kanye\u2019s team to clear a sample so his So Far Gone mixtape could be released on streaming, and a lot of threats.) On My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, Kanye also talked about his mental health, Donald Trump, and the #MeToo Movement. Per Pitchfork: \u201cWe as a society are constantly in fear,\u201d Kanye said. Dave responded, \u201cWell you mention a general fear of the male side of this situation. I would submit that it\u2019s not equal by any equation to the fear women feel being the other side of that.\u201d The crowd then cheered. \u201cI\u2019m definitely supportive of the women,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is we\u2019re not allowed to have any conversation. When you go to court, both sides can talk. This is a court of public opinion where when someone bombs first, the war is supposedly over.\u201d Dave responded, \u201cThese lessons are learned slowly, and that may be the way it\u2019s perceived now, but with future reinforcement and enlightenment, there may be a more reasonable expression of friendliness between the sexes that isn\u2019t threatening to women.\u201d\nEven though Kanye was coy when it came to Drake, he spoke extensively on his support of Trump because of course he did. \nThe first episode of the second season of #DavidLetterman\u2019s My Next Guest Needs No Introduction starring Kanye West premieres onNetflix on 31 May.

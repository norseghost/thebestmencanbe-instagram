trigger warning⚠️ : call out your friends who are predators and harass people on campus. Fisk University should be a safe campus for all but there are many stories of women who have been assaulted, stalked and harassed by our own Fisk men. As a small campus, it ought to be easier to hone in on sexual assault awareness and getting rid of the filth that surrounds our college life. The expoing that is being done on Twitter is right on time because maybe we couldn’t spare older classes from harassment, but hopefully we can spare our incoming classes. #metoo #sexualassaultawareness

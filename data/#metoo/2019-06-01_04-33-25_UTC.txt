For the first time, in a long time, I’m hopeful. ...talk about it, let it be known, so it doesn’t have control over you anymore... Something I thought wouldn’t happen. 
Healing can be tricky. It’s not linear. 
Just when you think you’re good...you’re not. The process starts all over again. It’s hard. It’s debilitating. It can cause you to lean on things you normally wouldn’t lean on. You do things just to get by. 
I’m not a crier. I never have been. But I’ve cried more times than I count. I cry for what was lost and not know what’s to come. 
I’m not healed. I’m not sure I ever will be, but I’m hopeful, for once, that I can move on. That I can speak my truth even if people don’t believe me. 
My heart aches every damn day. I’ve given up a lot just to be able to smile without forcing it. 
I’m hopeful, even though I know I’m gonna have days that are gonna suck. I’m hopeful, even though I know I’m gonna be happy one minute and cry the next. I’m hopeful, even though someone took something form me that I can’t get back. I’m hopeful, that despite everything, I can still smile.
I’m hopeful, that as I become more comfortable sharing my story, I can help someone who is afraid to share theirs. 
Most of all I’m hopeful that the small circle of people I have beside me believe me and are there for me. They love me and are there for me. They encourage me to stand strong. 
I’m hopeful that I can regain control and not let it control me anymore. 
I may not ever be the same but I’m making progress to become someone stronger than I was before.

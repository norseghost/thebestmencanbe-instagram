‚ÄúRodents are more responsible and care much more about their own species than rotten politicians and their surrogates toward their own nations. They chew on the constitutions to rip them apart. Their dens are in the governments, congress, parlements and judiciary systems. So if you think your responsibility is just to go to the voting booth you are dead wrong.  Make your own research way before you go out voting, if you want to clean up and improve to save our democracies. ‚ÄùR.F.

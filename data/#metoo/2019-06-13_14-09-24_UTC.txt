Pole dancing, just like any other physical sport, requires strength, agility, power and control – And whilst it’s true that perception is changing, it unfortunately still has a somewhat salacious reputation – after all, pole dancing generally takes place in men-only clubs, where women remove their clothes for money.
This film aims to change this common perception and take it out of the Red Light District. Remove the veil of sexuality, and highlight the amazing athleticism and beauty of pole dancing.

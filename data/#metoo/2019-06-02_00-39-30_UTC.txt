Your words matter. And what you say over and over to yourself will determine your life’s direction. ⠀

I learned this in vivid detail when I found out I had cancer in 2012. I realized that my words and my confessions were literally a life and death deal.⠀
⠀
If you aren’t sure where to begin, ask God! Ask Him for His perspective on what you should be declaring. He says, if you seek him with all your heart you will find Him. Seek His wisdom. ⠀

Personally, I wrote down every scripture I could find on healing in a notebook and sticky notes… then I posted them everywhere so I was constantly renewing my mind in the Truth. ⠀
⠀
Facts are one thing but God’s truth overrides every earthly fact. So declare it over yourself and claim His blessings!

Network event hosted by Female Accelerators last year with important topics on the agenda. The female network group invited three power women for a panel discussion: Merete Eldrup @merete_eldrup CEO at TV2, Anne Sophie Münster @annesophiemunster Founder and CEO of the network organisation @inspiredbeyondbabies and Lynn Roseberry @lynnroseberry Board member, author... and Co-founder of and Managing Director at ‘On the Agenda’ to discuss three topics: fixed parental leave, gender quotas, and #metoo. It was not only in-lightning but also inspiring listening to the three perspectives of the topics and addressing these important subjects with an ambitious network group.

@remyma was featured in an @Huffington post article explaining how Incarcerated Black Women are Routinely 'Forgotten'. Remy goes on to say how "black women are overlooked all the time. People don't know all the hardships that being a black woman you have to face", she told HuffPost Jacques Morel Remy also says black women aren't just forgotten by the system. In addition, she speaks on her experience as a formerly incarcerated woman at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, how she witnessed several women not receive any visitors, especially from their children which is one of the biggest concerns for 80% of the women who are incarcerated and has children under 18 years old.

A number of men incarcerated doesn't receive this type of isolation. You go to a men's facility and there lines wrapping around the building, says Remy. Men tend to come home with a bed ready for them and a home cook meal where women who finally gets released are subject to the halfway house then to the shelter and many times there are women in prison for someone else's crimes when they fall victim to the "Girlfriend Case"  or the abuse-to-prison pipeline. Whatever happen to the #MeToo for the women who are serving time for being subjected to the sexual abuse while incarcerated and the reasons they decided to take matters in their own hands to rid themselves of their abusers.

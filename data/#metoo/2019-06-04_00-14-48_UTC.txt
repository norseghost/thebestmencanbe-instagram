Today an older man came into my work looking for flooring. His opening line to me was that he wished he took his wedding ring off before he came in here, if only he could have saw me first. After multiple sexual remarks he kept getting closer to me. I made it very clear I was uncomfortable. he then proceeded to say "it's a good thing you wont be measuring my house for the flooring, because if you were I would have to lock my wife up and pounce on you whether you liked it or not". I felt SO UNCOMFORTABLE. He did this while other customers were in the store. I couldn't imagine what he would've said or done if I was alone. I told some other people later in the day and one guy tried explaining to me how I need to start wearing higher cut shirts. SO LIKE FUCK PEOPLE TODAY. That guy basically told me he would rape me and then my low cut shirt was apparently to blame. Lmfao

"Bruce Robinson claimed to have been the target of unwanted sexual advances by Franco Zeffirelliduring the filming of Romeo and Juliet, in which Robinson played Benvolio. Robinson says that he later based the lecherous character of Uncle Monty in the film Withnail and I on Zeffirelli."
I will not mourn the passing of this man, another in the film industry who took advantage of his position and has, sadly, escaped appropriate justice.

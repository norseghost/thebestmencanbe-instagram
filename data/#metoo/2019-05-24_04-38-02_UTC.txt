Justice For Her ðŸ•¯
With everything happening in politics and our culture, reversing energy from people, places, and forces like media and politics is needed to help fight back what political leaders are doing to our sisters, friends, loved ones, and neighbors. Trans Women are being killed everyday, woman of color are being attacked and disregarded, reproductive rights are taken away...actually taken away, rapists are walking free....the world is going mad. 
I offer this candle online and in San Diego shops for anyone needing reversal regarding the challenges happening right now. Ingredients like Jezebel Root, Lavender, Rose Thorns, and more to reverse, heal, and fight back chaos.

“Do you know what’s fucked up? This happens to so many women all the time. I could talk to a lot of women and they would have a story similar to mine. It’s so fucked man. And no woman is getting justice because we have goddamn pussy grabber in office. He thinks fucking men are threatened. No one has time to lie about this shit and if they do they are piece of shit. Women are threatened. Fucking trans men/women are threatened. If they aren’t a goddamn white, straight, cisgendered male then they don’t matter as long as that fuck face is in office” 
So this a text I wrote to my friend this morning after telling her how angry I was that I got no justice for what he did to me. 
If you follow bro code that does not mean you cover for your rapist friend. You need to tell the police if you know it happened. If you cover for them you are just as guilty as they are. I’m done being silent.

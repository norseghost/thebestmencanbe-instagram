Happy Heart. Just got home from a city event regarding sexual violence. I feel really blessed to live in a country that provides survivors with support, and takes it seriously. I haven't shared much on social media, but my heart is to start my own organization in Tanzania, Africa for victims there. Currently there is very little support. Little by little I'm working on this, and am going over to TZ in October to start the process!!!

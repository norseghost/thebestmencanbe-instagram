Not rocking gravity defying breasts?

Breast tissue is fat, not muscle. This means over time they WILL sag. Itâ€™s actually a big myth that fake boobs donâ€™t sag too - they totally can!

A bit of boob sagging is totally normal. It is not something we should be made to feel embarrassed or ashamed about.

Women are under pressure to defy the whole ageing process. From boob sagging, to wrinkles, to grey hair, to weight gain. Companies make billions out of making us think our body getting older is a problem.

Shove your â€˜breast firmingâ€™ cream (that literally do NOTHING!). ðŸ–¤ My breasts may sag,
my breasts droop,
but I love my breasts,
and all the rest ðŸ–¤

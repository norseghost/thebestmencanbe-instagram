The sun finally peaked out today in Sorrento for a idyllic seafood lunch by the water before we heading out to Naples. While building up an appetite for pizza, we strolled through town, admiring the architecture and street art that is impossible to overlook, occupying all surfaces. We were pleased to see one that commemorated the Women’s March. Meanwhile, our historic building and quirky room for the night has some engaging and original decorative features, including an old school key and keyhole 🗝🗝🗝 #womensrights #womensmarch #metoo #nudm #feminist #femminista #feminista #streetart #graffiti #napoli #naples #keys #keyhole

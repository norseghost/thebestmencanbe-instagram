Roxanne Pallett has discussed her PTSD diagnosis and her regret over accusing Ryan Thomas of assault in the final series of Celebrity Big Brother last year!  We don’t know what to think about this? Is she being genuine or trying to regain some sort of career in the spotlight again?  Either way the accompanying photo shoot just looks far too “managed” for our liking! 🙄 Fire off in the comments to tell us what you think!!!

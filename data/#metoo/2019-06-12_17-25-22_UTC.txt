Looking for a way to #volunteer? Pillars Community Health is training new volunteers to help survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. 
We will be offering two training sessions starting in July: A Domestic Violence Advocacy Training and a Sexual Assault Crisis Intervention Training. Upon completion of either training, participants are prepared to volunteer on the respective 24-hour hotline for 12 months. 
Training sessions focus on crisis intervention, medical and legal advocacy, empowering survivors, and more. 
Pillars Community Health offers a variety of services for those affected by domestic and sexual violence, including our 24-hour hotlines and our domestic violence shelter, Constance Morris House.

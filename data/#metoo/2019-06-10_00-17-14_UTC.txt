This is Day 185 in benzo withdrawal with an iatrogenic brain injury from Valium that the doctors had me on for over a decade. ü§Æ 
Now I am hoping to raise awareness about the deadly dangers of benzodiazepines And the Lethal consequences of mixing Benzos with Opiates as my doctor had prescribed those 2 drugs together and I stopped breathing and died. God spared me and I am now here to help others from going through what I did with years and years of excruciating chronic pain, illness, heightened crippling anxiety from the benzo backfiring after prolonged use, as well as a grand mal seizure and hundreds of petit mal seizures in withdrawal. 
To anyone out there who is taking a benzodiazepine such as Xanax (Alprazolam), Valium (Diazepam), Klonopin (Clonazepam), Ativan (Lorazepam), or any of the rest: ***Please know that you have support here whether you are on the meds and are experiencing ‚ÄúTolerance withdrawal‚Äù, are going through a benzo taper and experiencing withdrawal symptoms, or are going through full blown benzo withdrawal or Prolapsed Withdrawal Syndrome. 
You are not alone. 
I am sending lots of healing thoughts to your coordinates. .

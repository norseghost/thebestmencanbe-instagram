Massive thank-you to @macmillanaus for sending me a review copy of #MeToo
•
I'm still making my way through this book, but I absolutely commend each and every one of the thirty-five brave women who stepped forward to share their story for this collection. There are a lot of good things to come out of the #MeToo movement, and it gives courage to us all to be able to stop and say NO, THAT'S NOT OKAY.

Here's to hoping the future generations are founded on equality, and the need for movements like this dwindles and dies out.

Synopsis:
In October 2017, the hashtag MeToo went viral.
Since then we’ve watched controversy erupt around Geoffrey Rush, Germaine Greer and Junot Díaz. We’ve talked about tracking the movement back via Helen Garner, Rosie Batty and Hannah Gadsby. We’ve discussed #NotAllMen, toxic masculinity and trolls. We’ve seen the #MeToo movement evolve and start to accuse itself - has it gone too far? Is it enough? What does it mean in this country?
And still, women are not safe from daily, casual sexual harassment and violence.
In this collection thirty-five contributors share their own #MeToo stories, analysis and commentary to survey the movement in an Australian context.
This collection resists victimhood. It resists silence. It insists on change.

- Yesterday I had an incident with an older adult, my mistake was to simply be nice to answer his question about whether my turn came first. That was "my mistake", with that the man thought he had the permission to harass me, follow me, cornered me to ask for my number phone and look at my legs. Tell me not to tell anyone. This is not the first time that happens to me, it happened to me since I was a little girl, it happened to me when I was 14 when a man thought that being my teacher could touch me. My mistake in those times was that I did not know it was harassment, I just knew that it made me feel bad. I never said anything to an adult. But now I am an adult and I have information, now there are many ways to report this type of situation, yesterday for the first time I reported harassment thanks to the guidance of a doctor and nurse, but it would have been for them I would have remained silent, waiting for the moment to leave that place and forget it because I felt embarrassed, I felt it was my fault to have answered, to wear shorts and because I did not want to make a scandal.It is very sad and disappointing that in these times a woman still feels bad about the fact that her body is that of a woman. -

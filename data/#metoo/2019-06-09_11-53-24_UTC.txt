After the much successful #metoo and #HeForShe campaigns, Womenite is back with yet another online changemaking theme called #breakthestereotypes challenge. Drop in any stereotype that you find inappropriate with the hashtags #breakthestereotype and #womenite and the reason why it needs to be broken and get featured in Womenite's stories! Further pass on the challenge to your friends and followers and start a chain of breaking the stereotypes that society has subconsciously inflicted upon us. It's time the society starts seeing us as normal people with our own individuality because we are much more than some mere stereotyped labels given to us.

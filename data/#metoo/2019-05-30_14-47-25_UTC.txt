This week’s blog shares some more in-depth perspective about overcoming cancer…and specifically, the four components that cause cancer to evolve in our bodies. Knowing this information is vital in the battle against cancer.

But there is HOPE in overcoming, and I want to share it with you.

My 30-minute TV special is airing again this Monday, June 3 at 9:30 PM EST/6:30 PM PST on Trinity Broadcast Network (TBN). Who's going to be tuning in and watching with me?? I'll be sharing about my journey of overcoming Cancer, and you'll get a special opportunity to get an advanced print copy of my new book: How I Beat Cancer.

Will you join me in praying and spreading the word so that people who need to hear this message of healing will tune in this coming Monday?

Believing for amazing and miraculous things in your health,

Andrea

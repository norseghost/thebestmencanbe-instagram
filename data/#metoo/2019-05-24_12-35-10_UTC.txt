Please help this amazing non-profit @kadakcollective 
Kadak is a collective of South Asian women, non-binary, and queer folk who work with graphic story-telling of different kinds.

They have now started a Kickstarter campaign to produce a book by 50 South Asian contributors across 13 countries, about geography and gender, identity and self, boundary and exclusion.

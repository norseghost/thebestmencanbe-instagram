we are not just connected. We are interconnected as sisters, women, mothers, survivors, thrivers, and conquerors.  As champions, as vessels, as life givers, as students and as teachers.  We help one another though the challenges, celebrate successes, listen intently, and hold another accountable during our uncomfortable part.  We grow together, we party together, we celebrate together and together we can achieve anything.  What does sisterhood mean to you? #mentalwellness

So how do you create safety when your whole world feels unsafe? For me, part of that process is dog training. Working with Atlas has given me so much insight into my own mental health & care. Dog training has taught me to create new positive experiences for myself & reclaim triggering spaces. Because of our work together I have been able to not only survive but thrive in spaces I never thought I would emotionally be able to inhabit.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nOne of the most useful lessons Atlas taught me is that not all healing has to be painful. I used to have a long sleeved dress that I loved. It was a hand me down that had probably seen its best days before I was born, but it was my favorite thing to wear...until I was sexually assaulted in it. After that I could barely look at the dress. The idea of donating it felt wrong, & throwing it away felt like I was letting my fear win. One day, instead of averting my eyes or closing the closet door I got a pair of scissors & cut it up. I cut off the sleeves, stuffed water bottles inside & tied off the ends as crinkly toys for Atlas. I cut the rest into strips & braided them into tug toys & pulls. Somewhere in the process of tearing the dress to shreds I stopped being scared of what the dress meant to me & thought instead about what the dress would become.\nI will never forget the look of joy on Atlas\u2019s face when I handed him 5 new toys forged from years of suffering & pain.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nAtlas & I spent the next few weeks happily destroying the toys together. By the time I threw the remnants of my dress away they were shredded, dirty, & had no power over me anymore.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nOver the past few years I\u2018ve made a ritual of cutting up triggering clothing & turning them into toys. Sometimes it\u2019s clothing that reminds me of my abuse, sometimes it\u2019s clothing that makes me feel bad about my body. It may take me years to replace a lifetimes worth of abuse in polyester, denim, & cotton but every time I do, I take a step towards a life free of the shadow of trauma."

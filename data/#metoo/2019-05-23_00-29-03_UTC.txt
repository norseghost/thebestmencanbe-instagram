finishing a 17 week trauma support group on a high note with hand painted postcards for everyone. It is still #mentalhealthawarenessmonth, and I can’t encourage you enough to seek out resources for healing and support. .

Whether you struggle with an active mental illness or injury, or just need help sorting yourself out or navigating a difficult experience, it is worthwhile to find people who share the same experience and/or talk to a professional, who has no stake in your life other than to help *you*. .

A former version of myself scoffed at support groups, thinking they were for Other People but would Never Be Helpful For Me. I used to think that about a lot of things — I had an overinflated sense of exceptionalism, and believed that I was unique in my difficulties, struggles, shame, and flaws. I believed my pain was Unique. It was silly, and retrospectively, an obvious defense mechanism against being vulnerable. I’m glad I finally got over it, and started trying *anything* and everything to make myself a better person. I’m still not perfect (damn it!), but better a little bit every day. .

If you are waiting for a sign to try a new approach to managing your mental health, this is your sign. Try it. You have nothing to lose, and if it doesn’t work out, you can leave it behind. You don’t have to take everything with you—just what works for *you*. ✌🏼

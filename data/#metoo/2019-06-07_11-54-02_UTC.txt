Joe Biden backpedals his statement and support for the Hyde Amendment due to backlash regarding the restrictive nature of the amendment which cuts federal funding for most abortion procedures by making it largely inaccessible for Medicaid policyholders unless they fit a narrow criteria.

After receiving criticism from Elizabeth Warren regarding the Hyde Amendment Joe Biden stated, "If I believe health care is a fight as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone's zipcode." Biden's odds adjusted after he retracted his support for Hyde.

Fucking manchildren. I was having such a good day until this fuckboy decided he was entitled to my company, and abused and threatened me when I refused to visit him (because he's drunk and I'm trying not to fall into old habits, not that I owe anybody any explanation). This is the tamest part of the exchange, and at no point was I at all aggressive or rude. It's funny how as soon as a woman turns down a man's sexual advances, she's automatically a whore and a slut, and then when we do have sex with them, we're still whores and sluts. And this is all coming from a dude I've known for almost 3 years. Fuck these insecure, emotionally stunted, immature little boys with their tantrums, sense of entitlement and whorephobia.

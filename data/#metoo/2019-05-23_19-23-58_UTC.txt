HYSTERIA 004 // I’ve never been able to grasp how women often treat other women. We hurt each other — and our shared cause — more than any man ever could.
.
Whether or not we acknowledge it, society has conditioned us for generations to compete for resources we’ve been scammed into believing are scarce: Husbands and children. Jobs, promotions and raises. Material wealth. Success. Security.
.
We sustain a damaging system of insecurity — constantly logging one another’s flaws and filing them away for later use — because we know in any given enterprise there’s only room for one of us at the top. We’ve learned that suppressing our femininity affords us the best hope for success. We have to be in on the joke. “I’m a woman, but not one of THOSE women. Pick me!”
.
We uphold the patriarchy because we’ve learned how to benefit from it. We think we’ve outsmarted the system. White women in particular know that if we don’t make waves, we get all the privileges. We think we get to be in on the joke.
.
In fact, women powered the anti-suffrage movement. A woman led the campaign that prevented the Equal Rights Amendment from becoming law. A woman wrote the Alabama abortion ban; another signed it.
.
One would expect female lawmakers to champion causes that reduce women’s burdens because they personally understand our struggles. But rather than appeal to our shared humanity, many work instead to ensure their own survival: “If I uphold the standards of the patriarchy in my community, they will empower me.”
.
Being harmed by another woman is the ultimate betrayal — a puncture wound in our vulnerabilities — because she fundamentally understands what’s at stake.
.
But the joke’s on us. Men have learned how to exploit it all.
.
We too often pump our girl-power pompoms only to revert to the same behaviors that keep us here. It’s madness.
.
The only way to change this system is to unite in sacrificing the privileges and perceived securities we’ve individually worked so hard to achieve. What are YOU willing to sacrifice? #hysteriaseries

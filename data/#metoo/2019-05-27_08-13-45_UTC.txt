My name is Tejaswini and I come from a place where even today girls are denied their rights to education. I am grateful to God that I have parents who have always encouraged me to fulfill my dreams.

As a kid, I was the naughtiest in the family and would get all the attention. I never realized there were people around me with bad intentions as well.

We had staff at our place and I remember, I was in grade 3, the staff member would touch me at inappropriate places and as a mean to keep me from sharing this with anyone he would bribe me with my favourite soft drink. He continued molesting me with his friend until I reached grade 7 and then it happened again when I was in grade 10. I knew it was wrong but I was never able to gather enough courage to share it with anyone. Until one day when my brother made a short film on harassment and uploaded it on his YouTube channel. After watching the movie, I cried my heart out and confided to my brother. He shared everything with my dad and strict actions were taken against those two individuals.

I still find life to be a very beautiful thing. I go around helping people, pull them out of misery and I don’t do it because I support a particular “cause”, I do it because I have faith in “Humanism” and helping someone does not make me a better person instead I am just serving the purpose of life. - Tejaswini, @tejas__wini .

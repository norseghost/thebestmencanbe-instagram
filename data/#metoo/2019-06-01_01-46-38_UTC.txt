Today is the last day of mental health awareness month... I am truly grateful to have been born with stable brain chemistry, great health, loving friends, caring family and the opportunity for wonderful fulfilling work. I also suffer from bouts of anxiety at other times episodes of depression. You probably would never know, I would still smile, laugh and make pleasant small talk. At times I feel very lonely under the crushing weight, exhaustion and pain of burnout, feeling like a phony and I can’t tell anyone as I teach about emotional intelligence, communication and well being. Thanks to my amazing wife @angie_luna_oconnor, open and understanding friends, counseling, meditation and a lot of self love today I am happy and at peace with all of me. Thank you to everyone who has shown me love and acceptance,I could never have gotten here on my own. I don’t know what tomorrow brings but I know I will not be able to thrive without the support of honest and loving people I trust. Awareness creates choice. Thank you for joining this conversation and helping to remove the stigma around mental health care. Reach out. Lean in. Love all of you. #mentalhealthawareness #grateful #gethelp #dontgoitalone #together #metoo #connected #awareness #mentalhealth #healing #love #acceptance #freedom #peace #joy #pain #human #thankyou #life #may #happy #peace #share #talk #reachout #support

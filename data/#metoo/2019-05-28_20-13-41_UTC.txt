Let’s talk about #rapeculture for a minute. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So often when sexual violence comes up, we focus solely on the perpetrator when really sexual violence is a community issue.

Without a community that implicitly or explicitly condones sexual violence through its values and practices, sexual violence wouldn’t be perpetuated on the scale that it is.

Of course, there are many factors that contribute to sexual violence, but be sure of this: one of them is “good” people doing nothing when horrible things happen to other people. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

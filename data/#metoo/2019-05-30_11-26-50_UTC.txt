"Sometimes, you have to say no because something more is on its way." - Shikesh Sorathia

Do you ever find yourself thinking about Plan B if Plan A doesn't work?

If you are, then you're not the only one. Putting all our energy into something and then seeing no results is a fear we all have. After all, no one wants to fail, right?

What if I said you would never fail no matter what you were trying to achieve? Where even though your journey won't happen in the way you intended, it will still take you to your destination!

One thing which I enjoy doing to laugh and be inspired, is to watch #steveharvey. He was talking about achieving your dreams on his talk show and it really hit home!

He went on to say that there is no such thing as Plan B because you can't give focus to two different things. How can you give all your focus on achieving your dreams if you are working on something else, just in case it all fails?

There is only one plan and that is Plan A. If we decide to call it quits and do something else, then it's not a Plan B, it's a new Plan A!

This made complete sense and I think we should all follow this step. If we want to achieve our dreams, then our focus needs to be on Plan A only! 
When it comes to doing what we are most passionate about, there is no room for distractions!

What do you feel you need to do to focus all your energy on your Plan A?

What can you do more of to achieve your Plan A?

Happy Thursday! This week has gone by so fast with the three day weekend. Today's #ThrowbackThursday is dedicated to Rachel Carson, an American Marine Biologist known for her writings to promote environmental movements. In 1907, Carson was born in Springdale, Pennsylvania. Carson attended Johns Hopkins University to obtain her Master's in Zoology. She worked for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries as a writer for radio scripts. Simultaneously, Carson wrote articles regarding natural history for the Baltimore Sun. Eventually, Carson became a science writer and published writing on nature, marine biology, and the ecology of life. In 1936, she became Editor-in-Chief of all publications for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service. Later in her life, she retired from the government and dedicated her time to her writing. Carson has made a huge impact on America's awareness regarding our planet. Her work has led to an abundance amount of natural science research.

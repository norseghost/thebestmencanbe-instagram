Watching the judgment fly on the US Women’s Soccer team for celebrating (1) scoring in the World Cup to begin with, (2) outscoring their opponents and not letting up (3) showing emotion for SCORING IN A COMPETITIVE SPORT and also, DOMINATING reminds me of another legend who dominated and then everyone had an opinion about it.⠀

If you’ve worked your ass off for it, don’t let up. And fuck the people who think you should. 🖕🏻

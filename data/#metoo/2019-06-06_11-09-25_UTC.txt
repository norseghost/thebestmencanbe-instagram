This is something I never thought I’d be posting anytime soon. It’s been a battle for most of my life; trying to find the words to describe what my own personal trauma is and what it means to me. Trauma is something we are built to hold shame in. This shame is something we carry with us and it feeds negativity into all other aspects of our lives. In recent months it’s been a process to cut a significant spade of toxicity out of my life and to acknowledge my own trauma. I am a victim of sexual assault and sexual harassment. And it took a significant person in my life to deny my traumatic experience to finally allow myself to acknowledge it to others. It is something I am still working through and I am very grateful to the support that I do have; the people in my life who unconditionally love me and have empowered me to speak up. Here’s to continuing to speak out and to supporting eachother and their stories. #metoo

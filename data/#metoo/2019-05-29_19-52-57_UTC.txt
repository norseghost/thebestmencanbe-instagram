I choose a word or phrase to focus on each year. This year, I chose "Own it." My goal this year is to examine my life and myself and change what I don't like and to own up to all that I am. 
Yes I have a loud laugh, but it brings delight to those around me. To those it offends-they can cover their ears. I own my laugh. 
Yes I can be enthusiastic and even bombastic, but that's my personality. I own it. You can love it or leave it. 
Yes I believe we all have value. I believe we all can have a positive impact on those around. I will not judge a person for who they are or where they are. I believe we are simply called to love each other and I own that. 
I believe women are the future and I'm passionate about unifying and supporting all women. I own that.

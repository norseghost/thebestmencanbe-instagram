When someone is sexually abused, it stays with them for the rest of their life. You ask yourself why it happened and what you could have done to prevent it, when in reality someone STOLE something that did not belong to them. You are not responsible for their actions.

This photo in particular means a lot to Marissa and myself. After something sexually traumatic happens, you feel alone, angry, broken, and empty. This photo represents those feelings and the rest of the session represents owning herself again (coming soon!). The reason I love Boudoir so much, is because I get to help women TAKE BACK their sexuality and own their body again. This was such a touching session with a warrior.

Working on loving myself as much as I love what deeply impacts me in this vessel in this lifetime âœ¨Learning how to take my own advice and patting myself on the back. Finding what fits and feeling a little more me ðŸ˜‹Donâ€™t let trauma of the past affect you in your present; the future is bright. Thanking the universe for the many blessings and finding peace in appreciating the little things.. itâ€™s not about the destination - itâ€™s about the journey. #StandStrongWarrior #MeToo

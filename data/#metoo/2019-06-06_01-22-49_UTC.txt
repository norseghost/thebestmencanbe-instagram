America's most beloved sexual assault* ⚠️ Warning: long read but worth it.

This controversial photograph was captured on the day Japan surrendered to the US in WWII. But the real story behind the people in this photo is nothing short of horrifying.

The sailor, George Mendosa, drunken and reveling in the victory, was seen grabbing Greta Friedman, a dental nurse on her lunch break, and forcefully planting a kiss on her. The photographer saw him do this to multiple women before this and was prepared to capture the photo by the time he got to Greta.

Greta said in an interview: "It wasn't my choice to be kissed. The guy just came over and grabbed. I felt he was very strong. He was just holding me tight. I'm not sure about the kiss. It was just somebody celebrating. It wasn't a romantic event." She had also refused to re-enact the pose  in multiple public reunions that followed (well DUH!)

If you look close enough, the reinterpreted large scale statues are missing many aspects of the original photo, wiping out all clues of Greta struggling, her body awkwardly askew, while she was forcefully held, making it seem like a romantic gesture rather than an assault. It's as if the artists knew what to leave out to make this pose appealing! And how screwed up is that!?

This photo/statue unfortunately is re-enacted and celebrated the world over, for all the wrong reasons. So next time you visit any of the statues of "Unconditional Surrender", and feel like mimicking this "iconic gesture of love" scene, just..

Don't.

"This is not a drill. This is not a warning. This is a real public health crisis," - Dr. Leana Wen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood. Missouri’s annual abortion services license will expire ‪on May 31‬ and may not be renewed by the state. ⁣
⁣
In the event that the license does not get renewed, Missouri will be the first and only state to go completely dark on abortion services. ⁣

Our bodies, our choices.⁣

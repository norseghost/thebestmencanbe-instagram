I live on a busy highway by a store. I usually walk to this particular store to grab a drink as I did this morning, when a vehicle decided to pull up to where I was walking and parked and watched me as I go in and out of the store, then proceeds to leave as I enter my home, without going into the store. About 30-45 min later I go out to my porch to take a couple pictures and during this time I glance over to the road and my eyes are carried straight to same man standing at the edge of my grass staring at me. I go in and watch him from the window as he gets back inside his vehicle and sits for about 5 minutes then leaves again. On this note, I’m not scared, I’m pissed. I just know that whatever I’m wearing next, you’ll see me wearing a gun too because I’m not playing anymore. #metoo #womansrights #stopthemadness #loveyourself #protectyourself #rightocarry #instagood #love #makeup #weightloss #followme

Hopeless. A common feeling, when anxiety kicks in many scenarios come through my mind, each one of them judging me for every decision I ever made (wrong or right). Our mind is sometimes our strongest rival, ready to show you memories that you don't want to remember when you are vulnerable and panicking.

How to fight it? With self-assurance, remembering the positive things in your life, talking to a friend or seeking for help if it is too much. Always remember that you are not alone in this battle.

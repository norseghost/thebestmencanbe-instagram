It’s been ages since I was so happy about a story I did! Presenting my interview with one of the most important voices of our generation @jameelajamilofficial. She talks about #metoo, sisterhood and why it’s a good time to be brown. While talking about self love she says,
‘Kill your inner bully. Don’t allow anyone, including your own mind, to say things to you that you wouldn’t allow being said to someone you love. You have to protect yourself from negativity and fight back. It’s a daily learning curve. Recognise the voice in your head that tells you that you’re not good enough, or not beautiful enough, and tell it to shut up.’ The link is in my bio, please read !:) #jameelajamil #iweigh #iweighmovement #jameelajamilquotes

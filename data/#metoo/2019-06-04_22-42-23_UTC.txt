Full book review of Mrs Everything by Jennifer Weiner on my blog. ðŸ“– 
This was a fantastic book, an exploration of womenâ€™s roles and choices and expectations from the 1950s to today. It is the story of 2 sistersâ€™ lives and I was drawn into their world. Definitely a great read given the current #metoo movement. I love the way the book looks at the history of feminism and how far weâ€™ve come and how much we have to lose and does it in a compelling and readable way. .
Thanks to #netgalley and #atriabooks for the review copy. .

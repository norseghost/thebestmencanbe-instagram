There are “super apostles” in #montreal that preach constantly about fighting demons. Why? Because they want to keep people in fear. These church leaders know that a people who are scared can be easily controlled and manipulated. Watch out for these church leaders! If the focus of their preaching is not Jesus Christ, stay away from them!

Usually when i have hard days,  i do nothing but sit and cry. I overthink a lot about why all these are happening to me, 
Even if its a small little thing it bothers me so much i dont know why but all called me a sensitive person and i too agreed that entitlement!! This past one week has been so disastrous in my life,  ive been crying a lot that i almost became sick,  its ok if some person cries because i always think crying as an emotional cleansing of a heart,  i never felt ashamed of crying but my parents adviced me that i take everything to my heart and thats where the problem begins, and all sorts of names such as emotional idiot and centimental fool were the words people used to describe  me,  see its ok to cry,  we all are in the learning process... Imagine if this world goes completely emotion less,  feeling less,  centiment less i cant even imagine what all will happen in this earth if all of us go numb,  already there is enough theft,  robbery,  crime and rapes,  oh ya i should mention this ,rapes of even new born babies and even  new born puppies and goats ,this world is going to this extreme is because people are becoming heartless if emotions and centiments are lost ,this whole world will be rulled by brutality!!! Dont underestimate people's emotions,  respect other's feelings and thoughts, for that makes you a human, 
If next time anybody mocks at you as emotional idiot or centimental fool reply them by saying "its because of me that the earth recieves rain" for thats the real truth.
Its ok to have hard days,  its ok to cry,  nothing is permanent,  for this too shall pass,  you dont become weak by crying you grow strong ‚ù§

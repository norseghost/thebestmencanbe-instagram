I can honestly say I am blessed to have been in a 10year long abusive marriage. Finding the strength to simply make the decision was one of the most empowering yet terrifying things I've ever done.
.
There are moments when I really STOP and take time to appreciate the decisions, trials and tribulations, the heart break and soul lessons that have all lead to this moment. .
Abuse can be gradual and manipulative, it can rear it's ugly head in so many ways and soak you to your bones. All while at the same time family friends and co-workers don't see it because it's hidden, in the shadows and privacy of one's own home.
.
It has been 9 years since I walked away from that relationship and walked towards the truest version of myself. And I feel blessed each time I see a sunset and rise, a new and full moon, the birth of a baby and birth of new projects, the worldly wonders and the pureness of a child laughing. .
I can honestly say I am blessed. Thank you to you... For being in my life and along this journey with me. It is an honour üôèüèª
.
If you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship... Reach out! I am here. There is help. You're not alone! You can do it. One step at a time. .

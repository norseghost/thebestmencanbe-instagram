Carrying something for nine months is hard enough.  but to put a child in adoption center when there\u2019s already millions of unwanted children to begin. To just say put them up for adoption isn\u2019t fair there are people who get abused there I have a friend who is physically abused with their biological parents and then Verbal abused with the adoptive parents. It isn\u2019t a simple thing to say. Like to thank you for no vulgar language and no aggressiveness this conversation can also prove a point others that we can have disagreements without verbal or swearwords thought I point it out. At the end of the day I\u2019ve been there for someone who went to an abortion and it\u2019s not pretty it\u2019s flat out not pretty she didn\u2019t want get abortion she did but she did what she thought was right. No women wants to get an abortion. Women aren\u2019t having sex to have an abortion. An abortion is a difficult thing to deal with. I just don\u2019t like the idea how the government can be able to control the woman\u2019s body but there\u2019s no restriction on men is not make it fair at all and caring a baby again isn\u2019t easy to just say carry it for nine months is a lot any pregnant woman will tell you it\u2019s hard caring a child",

You have no fucking idea how traumatizing being raped is, for 9 months having to carry proof and a reminder of what happened to you is super horrific and traumatizing. The bundle of cells doesn't feel pain and doesn't have a memory yet, and i should be able to decide wether i keep it or not. You realize that this ban doesn't stop abortions right? Just the safe ones. There are a lot of young women who will be forced in life threatening situations to get rid of the cells, else they might be shamed or kicked out of their families",

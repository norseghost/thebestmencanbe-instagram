This #WomenOnFireWednesday we're discussing #WomenSupportingWomen! ðŸ’œ

Achieving equal rights starts with treating one another as equals. We speak of wanting equal pay and rights but have we looked at how we treat other women? Why is it that women have a tendency to be jealous of each other, instead of supportive? 
When women celebrate one anotherâ€™s accomplishments, weâ€™re all lifted up and that's how we become #WomenOnFire ðŸ”¥

When was the last time you empowered another woman? I would like to encourage you to tag a woman in these comments who inspires you, lifts you or motivates you!ðŸŒ·

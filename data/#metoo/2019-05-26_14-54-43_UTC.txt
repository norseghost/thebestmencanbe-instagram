There was a time in my life when I was in the midst of puberty and was obsessed with losing weight. I used to starve myself, exercise like crazy, and became a walking calories calculator. I managed to shed 10kg in 3 months. Plus, the what seemed to be harmless habit of Indonesians saying “you’ve gain weight” or “you’ve lost weight” when they have not seen me after some time did hurt me. It’s the one thing about Indonesians that I wasn’t proud of.

In 2013, I had a revelation about God’s love for me. I could vividly hear Him in my heart “why do you hurt yourself when I love you for who you are? Your body is my temple”. I was in a journey in discovering God’s love. What I discovered took my breath away and I had few opportunities to share it on stage with many girls and even adults.

Today, I’m happy with who I am, what I have become, and comfortable with my own body despite my big arms and thigh I was born with😂. I eat whatever I feel like eating without feeling guilty or even count the calories in it. I’m so happy to see my generation today embracing the “non Victoria Secret body” or curviness and encouraging other women who are suffering from body image and anorexia.

Girls, your health and happiness is the key, not the number. Embrace who you are, lose weight if you need to, but never, never, starve yourself or hurt yourself. Do it the right way, the healthy and safe way. Nonetheless, you are beautiful no matter what your skin colour or body type is. Don’t let them define you💕

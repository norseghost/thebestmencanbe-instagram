It can be difficult knowing what SDG 5: Gender Equality, specifically refers to. However, it can be broken down into 6 specific topics. SDG 5 aims to empower women across ALL nations of the world and ensure they receive any resources they need. This is done while breaking down any stereotypes and biases that exist in both personal and professional lives. In working to eradicate any pre-existing biases, we can all take part in ensuring this world is an equal one for all. •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

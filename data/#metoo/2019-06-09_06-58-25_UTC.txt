Hello. I love to paint. It’s therapeutic for me. I have Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, Fibromyalgia, Complex-Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Narcissictic Victim Syndrome.
🙋🏻‍♀️
Thank you for kickin it with me through my recovery. I don’t have a plan, I just want to paint. Maybe I’ll sell what I make, maybe I’ll just give em away. All I know is I want to create...

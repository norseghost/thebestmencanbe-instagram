we all have the power in us to make change happen. a bunch of "little" voices build up to be a strong voice. simply talking about issues you want to better spreads awareness. if you aren't able to make "significant changes", keep spreading your message. someone who is able to "do more" will see it and help. starting conversations about anything is important. those "small acts" are the sparks of change. you are the spark of change.

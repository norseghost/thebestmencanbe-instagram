This is an absolutely disgusting attack on @rashidatlaib from Rabbi Shmuley Boteach. He may be a Rabbi, but his extremist, pro-Occupation views do not represent Jewish values. Shame on the @nytimes for even publishing this manipulative content. 
Rashida, we will fight back against this and have your back when extremists on the right try and weaponize antisemitism against you.

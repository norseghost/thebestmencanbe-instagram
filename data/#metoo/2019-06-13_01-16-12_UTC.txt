Since getting my cancer-free diagnosis, my life has looked a bit different… and yet at the same time, not much has changed. ⠀
⠀
I’m still vigilant about continuing health protocols that make my body a place where disease can’t survive.⠀
⠀
No, those protocols aren’t exactly the same as when I was battling cancer. As your body changes, your approach to health should also change. As with anything, it goes in seasons. ⠀
⠀
But constant vigilance is important. It’s why I continue to have Dr. Hilu analyze my blood at a cellular level at a magnification of 65,000 times-- so that he can develop protocols for exactly what’s going on in MY body. ⠀
⠀
It’s also a powerful method for catching potential issues BEFORE they are a problem. ⠀
⠀
In 2018, I made a trip to Spain for two weeks of treatment. Even though I hadn’t been re-diagnosed with cancer, Dr. Hilu was able to catch some early signs. ⠀
⠀
Going was SO worth it. After retesting following my trip, my levels were normal and healthy.⠀
⠀
So let this be an encouragement to you: DON’T wait until you’re facing a death sentence to take your health seriously. Preventative care is always more effective!

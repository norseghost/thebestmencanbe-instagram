Um... Marc Lamont Hill, anyone? .

Its so crazy how white people can say anything. Literally, anything. Write books about anything (no lie, white fragility is the shit). Its fucking creepy
.

And i love(d?) Anthony Bourdain, but he has a well-oiled history of trend protesting (the #metoo ate him alive. He was out there taking *hard* notes from Asia Argento ...until she was accused of rape, Bourdain personally paid off her accuser; his twitter fell silent, ultimately ending in a suicide -- you can't trend protest. The nuances will literally kill you...)
.

The only reason I feel comfortable challenging Random House is bc I've been studying white people since gestation, and they have one move: manipulation (cue Asia Argento) .

Its clear that "Good" white people need like, a manual -- a protest starter kit
.

I might write one
.

Get into too deep, start seeing white people for 🐩🐩WHITE PEOPLE🐩🐩? A mind fuck like no other
.

Anthony Bourdain seemed to be a good as guy. Incredibly well-intentioned. When you take notes from "Jenny," the morbidly obese race theory professor at NYU who is a *practicing racist*? Well ... It mind fucks the "good guys" .

I'm not a not a good guy. I'm perversely honest.

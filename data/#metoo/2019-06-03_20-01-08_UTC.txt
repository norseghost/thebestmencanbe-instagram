[ID: text reads "WHY WE SAY THERE ARE NO GOOD COPS: But what about gay cops, what about Black cops, what about women cops. 1. Racism is not an individual act. Racism = prejudice + power. Policing is a violent, sexist, anti-Black instituation with impunity/systemic power. Modern policing literally originated as slave patrols their primary mandate is to protect property. 2. Police do not keep us safe. Police protect nazis and white supremacists. Police frequently kill Black/Brown/queer people. Police kill more people than mass shootings each year. Police do not stop gender violence, rhey cause it. Sexual assault is the 2nd most common form of police brutality. Trans people are 3.7x more likely to experience police violence than cis people. Less than 1% of rapes lead to felony convictions. Police assault their partners at 2-4x higher rates than domestic violence in the general population. Police have not kept schools safer, instead the school-to-prison pipeline targets Black & Brown youth. 3. What does it mean to be good at your job, when your job is to enforce racist, sexist, unjust laws?" @vrye]

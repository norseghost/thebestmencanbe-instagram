Is not having loads of friends an indication someone isn’t a good person?

I’ve only got a handful of people I would call my true friends. People I could call at 3am and know they’d pick up. People who would jump in the car and drive 4hrs to get me if I’d messed up. People who I can be totally ‘me’ with, with no worries of judgement.

But is it odd I don’t have more amazing friends?? I see women with hundreds of them! HUGE groups of women who are apparently all ‘besties’. I can’t help think, it’s just not possible to have that deep a friendship with 20+ other people. I like my small but sweet circle. It doesn’t mean I’m a loner or I’m a nasty person or I have no heart! It means I pick the best of the best to bring into my life 🌍

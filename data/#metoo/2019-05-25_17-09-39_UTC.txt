Yesterday is the first day I have worn makeup after my incident.
A couple weeks a go I was physically abused by my boyfriend. So bad that I ended up in the ER, my face, neck, and body were all covered in bruises, cuts, and I even have a bite mark that’s still healing. Yesterday was the first day I left okay with my appearance. First day I left confident enough to put makeup on and go out to have a good time. It took a lot of strength to feel okay again. I’m still emotional not right but at least I look better. •

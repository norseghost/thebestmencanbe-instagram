Heart.
Body.
Intellect.
The triad of human intimacy.
But, we're all so fucked up arn't we?
I've emptied my pockets,
Protected those I loved in exchange for a hollowed soul, 
Searched for healthy outlets to channel this restive tenacity,
A tenacity that's so often a shallow breath away from cruelty.
So my dear lover,
I'll let you choose.
Pick two. .

The art is from www.raganbonciart.com; I added the cursive. She sells prints, and her work mesmerizes me.

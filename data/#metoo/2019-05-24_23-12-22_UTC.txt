“And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” That is Mordechai’s challenge to Esther and our challenge today.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In younger days, I thought dreamily about how God asks us to use our influence for His glory. Sometimes he brings us into positions of power to enact change.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But there is more going on here. Esther was tasked to bravely petition the same powerful man who enslaved her in his harem. And her response? Pray for me. “And if I perish, I perish.”

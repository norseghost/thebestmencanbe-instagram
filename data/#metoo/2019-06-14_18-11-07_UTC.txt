👆🏻This is one of my songs that @kygomusic & @fifthharmony copied. Kygo’s camp sent tracks to me then as the songwriter, I wrote my melody/lyrics with a “pop sound” even though they wanted an “indie sound”. They “passed” on it. ⏭ Fast forward to Kygo & Fifth Harmony releasing the song, taking MY melodies and MY concept. If someone breaks into your home and steals YOUR property, they are deemed a criminal but in the music industry, it’s ok to steal someone else’s creative property?! Not cool.🤚🏻 This is a taste of what we as producers & songwriters deal with all the time—I’m not the only one. I love this song, I love what I do but hope that fellow artists, creators, A&R’s and execs will stop playing dirty, become aware, speak up and start giving credit where it is due. I’m a fan of the girls of @fifthharmony and also of @kygomusic but credit is credit. Hope you enjoy this bop as much as I enjoyed writing it 🖤🎵 more to come!! Full link in bio xx

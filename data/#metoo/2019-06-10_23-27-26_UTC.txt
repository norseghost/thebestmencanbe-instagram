ðŸ’Ž @ziggyramo ðŸ’Ž Levels. Strength to you Ziggy ðŸ’Ž Youâ€™ve remained grounded through the years. Thank you for showing us this level of self. Itâ€™s important. Itâ€™s compelling. Itâ€™s honest & you are valued. I hope it spurs more men to do the same. From my perspective, we need men to stand with us, more than ever. ðŸ•Š #IAmASurvivor .

Strength doesn't = agression and force. To me, the ultimate test of strength is to be compassionate. I'm a warrior, but I'm a warrior of love ðŸ§¡ Link in bio. @theline_au #NeverFollow #Ad

Peace and Blessings, 
Healing has been my main focus
With that so has been protecting my peace of mind, space,sanity..
SELF. 
I spent so much time looking to friends to be my motivation, my inspiration, my reason.. until I woke up different. 
Just recently. 
I realized I can only be my best self 
By loving myself and becoming my own goals.
When I look in the mirror I see a different woman. 
My vibe is different. 
I come first. 
I’m learning, I’m healing 
And I’m sharing everything with you. 
Take notes sis, 
Share some with me. 
Let’s Talk! 
Love, DeyelahDea

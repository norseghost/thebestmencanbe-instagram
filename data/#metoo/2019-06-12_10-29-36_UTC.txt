And lets not forget the complete omission of the Pussy Palace (lesbian bathhouse) raid that occurred on Sept. 14, 2000. .

19 years ago "355 scantily clad women were gathered and when the party was in full swing, two female police officers first slipped inside to check for possible liquor violations, then quickly summoned five male officers." (@GlobeAndMail). In the end male police officers broke it up and laid several charges against the organizers, accusing them of violating liquor laws.

If the cops really were trying to keep us safe (oooohhhh so dangerous partying naked in a place with violated liquor laws) why didn't they pop in before the party was in full swing, they obviously knew the even was occurring, and go over the laws? Why wait until we had all arrived and were partying in a various states of undress? And why send men into that space? Did Toronto only have two female cops on the entire force in 2000? Gotta love when homophobia teams up with misogyny and straight boy lesbian lust. Good times at the Pussy Palace. .

"After months of talks with police, the women who experienced the raid withdrew support from the official event held by Chief Mark Saunders on June 22, 2016 where he officially apologized for the police raids conducted on four gay bathhouses across the city in 1981, as well as other Toronto police bathhouse raids. Saunders did not single out or specifically apologize for the 2000 bathhouse raids in his remarks at police headquarters during the public apology." (@CBC)

The Toronto Police "regret" the bathhouse raids in 1981 and they have yet to address or apologize for the 2000 Pussy Palace raid so yah, I'll be forever sitting pretty over here at the "No Police at Pride" party. .

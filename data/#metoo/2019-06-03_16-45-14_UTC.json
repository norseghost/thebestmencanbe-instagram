As climate catastrophes happen in all corners of the planet, prayer and direct political action seem wise remedies. A prayer, to me, is a song that enters consciousness from the spirit realms. It has frequency and vibration.\n\nPop stars are often spiritual messengers. People like me who enter business communities despite opposition and our better judgment, pop off too. We burst the bubble of colonialism, misogyny, and capitalism. #SeAcabaronLasPromesas."

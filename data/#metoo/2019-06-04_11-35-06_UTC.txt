✨Children are the future of our Nation. If they will face violence at young age then it will be for their whole life. Also, if children experienced abuse in young age have more chances to get involved in criminal activities. It’s our duty to preserve the rights of children and participate in campaigns or other activities to spread awareness among people against child exploitation.👍

Beyond thankful to @rockcreeksocial & @eaton.dc for providing the space and opportunity to share this first chapter of Middle Ground, the Visual Essay, with a live audience and bring some necessary conversations to life.  Major shoutout to the ladies of @thehoenesttruth for helping facilitate those conversations so naturally!

Also very thankful to everyone who came out in person, supported from afar, viewed my films or participated in one of my conversations throughout this run!  Middle Ground Chapter Two is in the works, and more screenings of Chapter One  are on the way!

#RealWomenRealNetwork | Join us for @Chatsandcocktails Unfiltered; To Envision your dreams is the first step, to work towards it (in execution) is the next, defining step. Dreams don't work unless you do and in our #RealTalkSession, conversations will be had with our Host and Founder @Nkemonwudiwe on EXECUTION.

We will also be creating and updating our #VisionBoards to set our Intentions for the next few Months of 2019!

If you're a progressive woman looking to stay driven and focused, we cannot wait to meet you! (If you're coming from out of town, send a DM, we just might have free accomodation for you!)

We are so excited about our UNFILTERED themed mixer holding in June in Ikoyi, Lagos! The second half of the year has no other choice but to be fruitful and we're being very intentional about the steps we're taking to see it to fruition!

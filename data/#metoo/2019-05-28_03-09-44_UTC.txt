The reality of abuse, physical and mental, in the South Asian community is deeply silenced. We are told to sit quiet to maintain the family “reputation”, and conform to the patriarchal ways of living. The first time I told my mother about what my dad’s brother did to me, her first words were, “shhh”. The second and last time, I broke down and brought it up, my father consoled me by putting his hand on my head. I thought to myself, “finally”. But, we NEVER spoke of it again. I wasn’t asked what I need, or what exactly happened. In fact months later, pictures of my uncle in the “family album” were still found mixed with my pictures. I remember my body going numb. See, I have seen my father turn his physical violence into emotional abuse. I saw my mother conform to these sexist actions. I CHOOSE OTHERWISE. I call my abusers out in hope, that we as a community we start to read these stories, and reflect on the kind of future we are paving for ours to come. I encourage my QT+NB+GNC+South Asians to listen to their friends, and family members who have experienced such evilness. To believe in them. To stand up for them, and fight with all their humanity. No relationship is worthy of preserving that compromises anyone’s dignity, and value. So, look out for each other, and give every perverted uncle a bruised eye. I feel so exhausted in my body today, and so thought to write some of it down. Sending love and light to all of you dealing with these systems, may the oppressors burn in ashes. #transandpunjabi #transmanofcolor #transgender #punjabi #sikh #poetry #lgbtq #queer #survivor #metoo #abuse #victim #rapestory #genderandsikhi #equality #poet #writer #spokenword #spokenwordartist #artist #wontbeerased #transrightsarehumanrights #performanceart #transman  #transition #ftm #singh #armaanthepoet

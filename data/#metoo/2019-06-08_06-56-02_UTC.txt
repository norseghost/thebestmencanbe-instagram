I don’t know whether you support feminism or not or if you understand it or not.
But today I’ll tell you the kind of feelings behind it’s beginning. Come feel with me
.
1. It could’ve been a question - why me? Just because I’m a girl? The question a young lady asked me right now while narrating the story where she got harassed by one of her family member.
.
2. The feeling to carry the burden of piles of such disgusting episodes throughout one’s life. Trust me, with each such incident you invest a little bit of you.
.
3. To feel like you belong to a constant war which doesn’t seem to end distinctly. The one where you can never put off your armour and let down your guards. To be prone to an attack at any and every point of your life. You don’t know when you might get targeted.
.
4. Feeling a sense of continuous discomfort. To be under an eye of judgement, hate, stares, lust, boundaries and a lot more.
.
5. But you know at the top of it - it’s the helplessness you feel every time when some young girl or lady asks you these questions and you just don’t have a piece of solution out there because since your existence you’ve been undergoing the exact same things.
.
I don’t know if you felt me or it was just another shout in the void but that’s really it. We wear these feelings every day like our very own skin and you don’t know how desperately we are trying to get rid of them. ~Yours Wordly

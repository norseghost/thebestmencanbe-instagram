"Sisterhood to me means, sticking together. In my eyes it does not just mean women sticking together but a community of everyone  that understands women and empowers them. Acknowledging that being a woman does carry stereotypes and that we are not accepted or respected in many places. I can not count the times that I have felt if I were a man, life would be easier but I have to work twice as hard to be respected or notices. Sisterhood also means accepting vulnerability and unity as power with peers. It seems that the stronger or more successful I become the less weakness I can disclose and why is that? Sisterhood means a safe place for women to share common ground without judgment and lift each other up as to feel every time one of us makes a move, it is a move for the rest of us.

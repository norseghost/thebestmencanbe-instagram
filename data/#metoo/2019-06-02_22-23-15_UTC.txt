It is no news that we live in a very patriarchal society. A society that expects you as a woman to be permanently mute, weak and hunched over as this appeals more to your feminine. I have never fit into that stereotypical mold and whenever I lift my voice in expression, they call it rude!  Whenever I refuse to stay down they call it unusual and unlikely! In any case, I will continue to be rude, unusual and unlikely because in this human society, usual never cuts it! It really doesn't 🤷🏽‍♀️

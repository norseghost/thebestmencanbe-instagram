I give up, but not on myself.
I give up, but not on family.
I give up, but not on friends.
What I do give up is toxic people.
I give up living in distress.
I give up allowing myself to be stressed.
I give up the feeling of hurt and useless. 
I give up letting people put me down.
I give up hiding who I am.
I give up pretending to be someone I'm not.
I give up on everything that makes my bright world become a black hole.

But all I ask is don't give up on me because you'll never know what day will be my last.

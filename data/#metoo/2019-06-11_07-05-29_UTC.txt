"IS TUPAC STILL ALIVE??" - Yes!! If his music continues to inspire you!! My top 3 favourite songs from Tupac are Changes, Dear Mama & Letter To My Unborn Child.

Especially Letter To My Unborn Child, I admired how Tupac was looking into the future and acknowledging his present situation, being mindful, and trying to inspire his unborn child! Because he died with no children, I feel as if anyone inspired by the song is THAT unborn child!

So in my song GRATEFUL, I write lyrics to my UNBORN DAUGHTER where I hope "she born at a time, where woman are praised for their mind, and not sexualized, I pray you rise above the evil, and never need to scream #metoo and you're treated as equal"

Someone needs to hear this song, tag them, share it with them, let's spread positivity!

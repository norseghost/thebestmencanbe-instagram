                        "text": "I read a lot of leadership books but it\u2019s also important to make space for stories that allow us to tap into our humanity, for it\u2019s our humanity that frame how we lead.\n.\nMost recently, I read The Apology by @eveensler .\n.\nAs the @washingtonpost described it, \u201cthe novelist, activist and playwright, who shot to fame in the \u201990s with \u2018The Vagina Monologues,\u2019 has long said her father, Arthur Ensler, who died more than 30 years ago, sexually and physically brutalized her as a child.\n.\nThe book \u2014 or rather, the novella, as it clocks in at around 120 pages \u2014 is an unnerving, imaginative exercise and a harrowing account of abuse.\u201d\n.\nTold from the point of view of Ensler\u2019s father, the novel is brutal, raw, honest, painful, and yet somehow necessary, not only for survivors but for humanity, encouraging us to examine ourselves as Ensler forces the spirit of her father to examine himself.\n.\nThe decisions we make on a daily basis, often quickly and automatically, are informed by past experiences and background. Sometimes we don\u2019t even realize how our past effects how we act today, because we choose to forget.\n.\nEnsler calls this act of forgetting \u201cdiabolical amnesia\u201d, when instead of reckoning with our past, we choose to ignore it.\n.\nThis phenomena is relevant to leaders because when we don\u2019t name the things that define us and work to heal any negativity lodged inside of us, others usually bear the brunt of our detachment - that includes the people we lead.\n.\nIssues might manifest as unconscious bias, lack of empathy, or unrealistic expectations. And if we\u2019re unaware of our triggers, we stand to misconstrue the intent of our people, be more cynical and ultimately, keep our teams at a distance.\n.\nPeople aren\u2019t looking for perfect leaders, but we respond better to leaders who are aware of who they are and what brought them there. Spend some time examining yourself, and perhaps even writing your own apology.\n.\n#wokeboss .\n.\nThank you, @rachel.cargle for the book recommendation. As difficult as it was to read, it\u2019s a story that must be heard."

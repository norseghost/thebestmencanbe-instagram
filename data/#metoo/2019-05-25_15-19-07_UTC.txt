For all those who look down on Africa and Africans but drive cars with tires made from rubber stolen from Liberia, or use inanimate objects made from copper purged from Zambia, remember we didn’t come looking for you. You came and found us and decided we were not human, so the land could not possibly be ours alone. But I am the colour of the soil and the blood of my heritage has fed this land. As an African I wonder if she could speak for herself what my beautiful continent might say. So I wrote her “me too”, not on her behalf but hopefully to her standard, in the hope that you might understand. All I want for Africa is her freedom. She owns me, you see, and so long as she is owned by others, she cannot be free—I cannot be free.

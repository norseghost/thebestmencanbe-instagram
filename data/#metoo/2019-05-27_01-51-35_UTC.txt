“In the midst of winter I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.” This is a quote that has spoken to me quite a few times throughout my life but now more than ever. A few months ago I was sexually assaulted by someone I knew and trusted. Although its an uncomfortable topic, it’s a crime that happens far too often, and it’s my story to share. My assailant nearly destroyed me. I felt as though he robbed me of my very essence that made me, me.  Two things helped me immensely in my journey to healing: creating scared rituals with herbs and other natural ingredients, and adopting my cat Finian. Through my rituals I’m learning how to love and empower myself. Finian has taught me compassion for all living beings. Compassion for yourself and for others is essential.  So here I am, a survivor. My wounds aren’t fully healed, but I am creating a life that inspires me and reminds me to take time to love and be gentle with myself and whomever crosses my path.🌿

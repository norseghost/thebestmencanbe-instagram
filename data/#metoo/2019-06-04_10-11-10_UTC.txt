The 2018 winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry is urging a boycott of a physics competition in Tel Aviv in July.

George P. Smith and 19 other scientists signed an open letter last week that calls on ‚Äúall students and mentors from all over the world not to participate in the next International Physics Olympiad in Israel and to stand for human rights of the young Palestinian pupils and students, including their right to education.‚Äù Smith, emeritus professor of biology at the University of Missouri, won last year‚Äôs Nobel Prize in chemistry for his invention of a process to evolve proteins that can be used to develop new medicines.

The International Physics Olympiad claims that its goal is to plant ‚Äúthe seeds of cooperation and friendship among students from all over the world.‚Äù But the scientists‚Äô letter notes that ‚ÄúUnder the present circumstances, citizens of many countries are de facto excluded from entering Israel and attending the IPhO, not to mention Palestinian students from the West Bank and Gaza.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs academics and citizens we wish to draw your attention to the serious situation facing Palestinian schoolchildren, students and teachers,‚Äù the letter adds.

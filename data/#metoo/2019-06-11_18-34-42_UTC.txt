PRAISE FOR CANDY APPLE BUTTERSCOTCH
"This is one of those books that really hits home if you've had a terrible relationship. Not like a bad breakup over something stupid...but the kind where you're totally convinced that this horrible person is your soul mate." "The accounts of the trauma are laid out in such a way that you know what's happening and are able to imagine it but you aren't bombarded with intense graphic imagery, which I appreciate as a survivor myself. Would definitely recommend!" "This amazingly written gem takes you inside the author's world and keeps you there, making you feel like a discreet "bug on the wall." I could not put it down." #writingcommunity #authorsofinstagram #independentpublisher #metoo #ptsdsurvivor #memoir #nonfiction

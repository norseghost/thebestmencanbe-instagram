                        "text": "Thank you Netgalley and Flatiron for the digital galley of Whisper Network. \n_______________________________________\nPossible unpopular opinion? \nFour Women are faced with the decision to speak up about wrongdoings within their office after learning that one of their fellow co workers is being promoted as the new CEO of the company. \nThis book and me. It's complicated. I started the book almost angry at how whiny the women were. I soon started to feel like I was being knocked over the head repeatedly with the same information. At some point, I almost dnf'd it. The story felt all over the place, the characters were borderline unlikable, The point of view shifted willy nilly and I could never grasp who was even talking in the first place. It was dry, bland, on the verge of boring me to skim. I felt like I already knew what was going to happen. And Then..... I reached the 80% mark in Whisper Network, Yes, 80%, and it soon turned into something that felt worth reading. I'm glad that I stuck with it. I started to feel something. There was a shift in the tone. The women came alive, The fight got stronger, the demand for being heard, more insistent. The end was satisfying. \nI wish that the approach had been better, because I see where the author is trying to go, but I just kept feeling like it was missing the mark. Despite this, the moments of momhood and parenting resonated with me. I was also completely invested in the fight these women were putting up in the face of the me too era we find ourselves in. \nI guess my advice would be, if you choose to read this one - fight the urge to dnf it. You'll be fulfilled by the end. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50/5\n\n___________________________________________\n\n#bookstagram #bookagram #bookstagrammer #amreading #bookpic #bibliophile #bookish #bookblogger #igreads #instabooks #reading #love #today #litfic #aesthetic  #photography  #photo #btwnthepgs #visualcrush \n#review #bookreview #netgalley #pink #women #metoo"

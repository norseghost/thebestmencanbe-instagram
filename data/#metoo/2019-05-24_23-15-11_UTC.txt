something i wish all parents and people in general understood!!! while my dad and stepdad arenâ€™t involved at all, my mom used to be sooo so bad at understanding this. although since iâ€™ve opened up about the abuse and iâ€™m in therapy, itâ€™s gotten tremendously better. still though, i have scars from the emotional trauma grades caused and getting into screaming matches with my mom. firm reminder that screaming at your children until theyâ€™re having constant anxiety and panic attacks is NEVER ok. it doesnâ€™t matter if theyâ€™re failing the class, are an exceptional student, have missing assignments, etc, it is NEVER ok, no questions asked. instead, approach them with kindness and ask them why they are struggling, create a plan for success on the basis of love rather than the basis disappointment and negativity!ðŸ¥°

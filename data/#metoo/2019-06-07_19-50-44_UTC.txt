Through the glass, you watched. And through the glass, you took from me that which was never meant to be seen. Through my drawn shades, I remember. And through my drawn shades, I can still feel that fear of which your dark shadow cast. Through the glass, you peered. And through the glass, you held me prisoner for crimes which were not mine... but yours. #metoo #yesallwomen

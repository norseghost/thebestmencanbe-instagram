We stan men and women in this household.
Edit: the comments show who the real feminists are damn. Feminism is about equality, not women over men. So insulting men in response to them insulting us is not the right play. Two wrongs don’t make a rights. 
Now comments I said that I think you folks should hear: 
Insulting men as a whole isn’t going to get us anywhere. It just makes the assholes more angry and the good ones more alienated. You can call specific men trash if you want, but don’t target an entire group just because some of them are “trash”. •

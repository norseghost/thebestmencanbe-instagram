Hi @libraausnz, I often use your 'Libra Girl pads with wings' in puberty lessons. The size is great for upper primary students and I love the fun facts on the wings. But yesterday I was disappointed when I saw the 'fun fact' pictured- we need to do better. 
Research on cisgendered participants has shown that males not only talked more often they also talked for longer (often to sell the ideas of others as their own!). Females in these studies falsely perceived that they talked too much, largely based on outdated stereotypes. 
This is not ok! 
Let's not make the next generation of menstruators feel like they shouldn't take up space, shouldn't have a voice, and shouldn't challenge the status quo.

P.S. I did not know that tuna couldn't stop swimming!

CLOSURE - *TRIGGER WARNING** Today has been quite possibly the most significant day over the past two years.
If you have followed me for a while you’ll know I talk openly and freely on this platform about my experiences in order to help other people and share some understanding.
Today my case was closed. The case that has been looming on my mind every single day for two whole years and it feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Being a survivor of rape has altered my life dramatically, for months after I blamed myself for walking home alone, I was angry, I wanted revenge. 
For someone that always claims she would beat the shit out of any person that would attack me, ultimately I was not that person and in that situation that night I was terrified, scared, humiliated whilst laying on the ground begging for my life all I could think about was never seeing my little girls face again. 
I was so scared I wet myself after managing to crawl onto a nearby neighbours lawn whilst screaming for help. 
The shame I felt whilst sitting on a hospital bed being prodded and poked was like nothing I’ve ever felt in my life. 
The exhaustion, the pain whilst having to recall the events in a recorded interview every detail made me sick to my stomach. 
I blamed myself every single day pounding myself with questions , was it my clothing? Was it because I walked home alone? Why shouldn’t I be able to walk home alone? why me?

The police dealing with my case have been absolutely outstanding from start to finish however the aftercare from other organisations is very questionable ***CONTINUES IN COMMENTS**** #survivor #rapesurvivor #metoomovement  #metoo #strong #womensupportingwomen #womenempowerment #womensrights

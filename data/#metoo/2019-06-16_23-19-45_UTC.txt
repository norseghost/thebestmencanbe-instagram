#SelfCareSundays— Self-care looks different for everyone and it’s important we take the time to prioritize our physical, mental and emotional well-being 🧖🏾‍♀️
•
Go for that run, pamper yourself, practice self-compassion, distance yourself from toxic relationships that are holding you back, listen to your body, give yourself a compliment, drink lots of water but also eat that second slice of cake, do a digital detox, de-clutter your space, and always protect your peace. The list goes on and on.

How are you currently practicing self-care? 💗

I am really glad that veteran actor #nanapatekar has been given clean chit by police in a #MeToo case. I have known Nana for years both on and off screen. He has a heart of gold and a spotless character. I was always confident that he would come out of this unwarranted controversy unscathed. My love and best wishes to Nana.

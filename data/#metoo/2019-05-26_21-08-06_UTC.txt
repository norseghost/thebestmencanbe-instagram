The sh*t that feminists and ignorant women post literally blow my mind.
They are some of the most hypocritical lot ever.
Yes a war on women when society caters to every single cry a woman gives about any issue, and yet women are way more unhappier in society than they've been at any point in time in the history of the human race. How about as a woman you shut up, its getting out of hand and insanely annoying listening to women ramble on and on blaming men for everything when it was a WOMAN who signed to pass this bill in the first damn place.

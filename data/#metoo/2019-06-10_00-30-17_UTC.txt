Let's stand by women, in whatever decision they make. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Let's trust that women know what is best for themselves, their lives, and their families⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Let's understand that this is not a decision they want to be making. That if things could be different, they'd likely have things any other way. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Let's trust that women know their bodies. Let's empower women to make decisions about their bodies, in a world where judgement and decisions are made about our bodies by others without our consent all the time. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Let's agree that we might not make the same decision if we were in the same position, but our opinions don't matter. Let's stand by women, in whatever decision they make.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

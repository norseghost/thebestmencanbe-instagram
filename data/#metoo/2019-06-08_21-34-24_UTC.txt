*content warning: trauma recovery* 
Many times people can become wrapped up in their healing and can begin to have a hard time separating themselves from what happened to them. This has happened to me, so many times, and when it does, I feel like I am nothing more than my trauma, even though that's not true. With that in mind, I focused today's post on things about me that are not about my trauma and recovery. The things that make me, me. My drama nerd days, my tattoos, my love of all things creative, and why I love the fall season. 
If you want to learn more about me and what else has formed the person I am, check out the blog (link in my bio) and it is at the top of BOTH the recovery section and the general section.

My Social Studies teacher once told the story of a girl in northern Nigeria whose father forced her to marry against her will, claiming female education was unnecessary. Two of her uncles arranged to have her transfered to a federal government college down south, but her parents caught wind of their plans and kidnapped the poor girl, bundling her off to the Alhaji who already had other wives. As a girl of a similar age, her story shook me. How can culture deprive a girl of her human right? Unfortunately nothing has changed since that era - underaged forced marriage still occurs in different parts of the world, and despite the health conditions associated with this practice including VVF, traditionalists continue to turn a blind eye. It was this story which loosely inspired Mirabel Shehu's plight in my blog novel, and in case you were wondering, the character WAS named after the Mirabel Centre, a Lagos-based women's crisis centre. Mirabel may be fictional, but our struggle to fight for our right to education remains real. And yes, I believe the forced marriage of a minor classifies as rape. Join the crusade - education is our right, marriage is our choice. #NigerianSeries #NigerianWriters #NigerianWriter #Nigerian #NigeriaBlogger #NigerianWritersCommunity #NigerianWritersHub #Nigeria #NigerianFiction #NoMeansNo #MeToo #ForcedMarriage #WomensRights #WomensEducation #NigerianWomen #MirabelCentre #Rape #TimesUp #NigerianGirls #NigerianMarriage #FictionBlogger #FictionBlog #Fiction

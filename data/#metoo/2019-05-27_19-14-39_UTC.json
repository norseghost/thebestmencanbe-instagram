These are what a lot of Americans look at as facets or aspects of socialism.\"\n.\nInstead, Hickenlooper called for a focus on economic issues, not social policies.\n.\n\"Certainly we want to address income inequality,\" said Hickenlooper. \"Absolutely we want to make sure that women have a right to choose, that civil rights and social justice are addressed aggressively, but we've also got to recognize to win in Ohio and Michigan and North Carolina and Wisconsin, we're going to have to get more to those kitchen table issues that have to do with somebody's job, or how many jobs they're having to work just to balance a household budget.\"\n.\n\ud83d\udd05https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/john-hickenlooper-democrats/2019/05/27/id/917733/\n. \u27a1\ufe0f Do you agree?\n...........\n#foxnews #cnn #democrat #liberal #democrats #liberals #womenshealth #metoo #momslife #parenthood #mommemes #progressive #socialists\n#lgbtsupporter #trumpsucks #republicanssuck #TrumpisanIdiot\n#economics #economy #healthcare #socialsecurity #seniorcitizen\n#proudtoserve #veterans #veteran"

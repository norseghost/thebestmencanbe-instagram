Titles can be dangerous. ⚠️ 90% of antisocial violence is committed by someone the victim knows. This can make it difficult to defend against, and even more difficult to come forward and reveal what has happened. But when ANYONE assaults or abuses or tries to kill another human, they are no longer the person you knew and possibly loved and trusted. Now they are the enemy, the human organism trying to cause you harm and must be treated as so. 💪🖕 No matter who they are, NOBODY has the right to hurt another human unless it is in self defense. 🙌 💪

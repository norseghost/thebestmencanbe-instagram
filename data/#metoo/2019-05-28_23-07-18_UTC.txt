Two in five Ethiopian girls are married before their 18th birthday and 1 in 5 are married before they turn 15 years old. To fight the practice of child’s marriage, the Plan Organization is spreading awareness about the presence of child marriage, while teaching Ethiopian girls to refuse child marriage. In addition, Plan negotiates with Ethiopian parents to change their views about forcing under age girls from being married . Samrawit, a member of Girls Club stated, “ I told my parents that I didn’t want to be married. But they refused. I was frightened when they were called from school.” After negotiations that took two weeks because of Plan, Samrawit was able to escape a marriage before adulthood. Today, Samrawit is one of three girls who escaped from child marriage this year. Similar to @planinternational,  #MeTooEthiopia strongly believes child marriage is threatening to Ethiopian girls futures and freedom. Please join us on our fight by signing the #MeTooEthiopia petition and spreading awareness of child marriage in Ethiopia.

This is misogyny at its finest. The patriarchy is alive and well. And if you don’t think it’s coming to get you, think again. 
The current anti-choice laws that have been passed in various states have been designed so that they are taken to the Supreme Court. Seeing the 7-2 outcome of this vote is there any question how SCOTUS will vote on abortion?

It’s not that I just looooove abortions. But I do LOVE  for all humans to have say over their bodies. And in a culture that defiles, subjugates, and controls women’s bodies there is NO SAY. We are forever the PROPERTY. It doesn’t matter if we are raped by stranger, friend, or father—we have NO SAY. It doesn’t matter if our life is endangered. We have NO SAY. If women were truly adored, respected, admired, and protected—and equal—this “debate” would not even be happening. Although there has been progress in women’s rights, we still live in a power structure that devalues us. #prochoice #womensupportwomen #metoo #smashthepatriarchy #motherearth #dotherightthing #riseup

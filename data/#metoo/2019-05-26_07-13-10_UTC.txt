Starting right now, you can decide how you spend your time, whom you socialize with, whom you share your life, money and energy with.

You can pick your words and the tone of voice in which you speak to others.  You can select what you will eat, read and study.

You can choose how you’re going to respond to unfortunate situations when they arise, and whether you will see them as curses or opportunities for growth… and most importantly, you can choose your thoughts, which dictate pretty much everything else.

In other words, you are what you think. You can’t change anything if you can’t change your thinking.

Train your mind to see the opportunity in everything.
Positivity and mindfulness are choices. The happiness of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts.

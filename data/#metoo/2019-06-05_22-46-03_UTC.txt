This is a 12 minute video of the interviews with each of us survivors. Our amazing legal representative, Irwin Zalkin, opens and then each one of us talks about out abuse and why we are doing this. Please watch and share far and wide. And as I say in the video, I’m doing this for those who can’t. I’m doing this for those who don’t have a voice. I’m doing this to shine a light on the darkness of this cult and the decades of rape, assaults, child and adult labor, and emotional abuse. Thank you to every person who watches this and to everyone who has reached out in support. (Link is also in bio) https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=nQx-P3mY6D4

"Sorry you are so rude and unstable" ðŸ˜¼ðŸ‘»ðŸ˜¸ I'm turning my abuser's words into empowering art. There's something satisfying about creating something positive from something which once made me cry and have panic attacks. When I was making this, I messed up and accidentally somehow made a hole in the paper in the middle of the face so I tried covering it with masking tape instead of starting over, and I liked how it looked so it became part of the piece. Funny how that's almost a metaphor for recovering from abuse, you have to tape yourself back together and keep going.

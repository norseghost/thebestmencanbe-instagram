Together, we raised over $100 for @rainn through selling #CreatedintheChaos tshirts. I couldnâ€™t have done it without every single person who BOUGHT a shirt, DONATED to my cause, & SUPPORTED me by sharing the fundraiser. Thank you all so, so very much.

Going into selling shirts, I was so worried that it wouldnâ€™t work out. A minimum of 20 had to be purchased for them to go into print, so every day I was stressing that I wouldnâ€™t make it. Sales were slow at first, one or two every few days, but then one night I got over 15 sales & multiple donations... in only a few hours! I remember texting one of my good friends, so excited at the slew of people all of a sudden investing into Created in the Chaos. It gave me hope & reassured me that I have something amazing here. Next time, weâ€™ll have double the sales, I know it. ðŸŒ· Donâ€™t forget to send in pictures of you wearing your #CitC shirt to be featured on our story!!!

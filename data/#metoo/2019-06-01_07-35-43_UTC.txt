I'm so incredibly proud of my daughter today. She was brave,  courageous, spoke up for herself today when a boy did something completely inappropriate to her during a fundraising event @chuckecheeses

And while this incident was extremely upsetting, it's even more upsetting that for the past four hours I've been trying to share this horrible experience on my IGTV, but for some reason @instagram has blocked the video from posting. I don't know whyyyyyy but I feel as though twice we have been violated today and it's not fair. So dear @instagram whyyyy can't I post my video? Why do you censor my content? This is not the first time this has happened; it's been too many times to count. Every time something happens to me and I try to share with my following, I'm always blocked from posting. My life is more than posting about what I'm wearing, or what new trend to shop or buy, it's about being a mom, a working mom and a decent human being and when something horrible happens to me I want to share it without being reprimanded for it. I'm going to limit my use of this platform if I am going to continue to be censored.

While at our local Chuck e Cheese Today for a school fundraiser, a boy pulled down my daughter's shorts while she was going up the tunnel to slide down. She immediately told two adult standing close by then came and told me. But she didn't stop there, she described exactly what he was wearing, remembered his shirt and hair color. Wow, I'm so so incredibly proud to be her mom. She SPOKE up immediately and wasn't afraid of anyone!

His mom's actions after the incident is shocking to say the least
...AND the actions or should I say the bully behavior of her friends towards me, the manager's insensitive reaction to the situation, and the way the sheriff department handled the whole situation is appalling, insensitive, incompatible, and down right unfair.

I've posted the video on my YouTube channel so if you are curious, go watch what happened and tell me if you think what happened was appropriate, fair or if it was handled properly.

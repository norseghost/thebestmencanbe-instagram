And by people, I mean #metoo
You may or may not know that I thrive with several rare, painful autoimmune disorders.
They affect my autonomic and neurovascular systems. 
#truestory, 1 legit causes my skin to catch fire.
It's why you rarely see my in anything other than flip flops.
Why I won't attend a night concert or many outdoor venues without my wheelchair.
I can't stand in hot water for more than 10 mintues and I don't do hot tubs.
I eat a lot of salt and constantly feel lightheaded. 
My heartbeat is abnormal, I have severe neuropathy and I struggle to regulate my body temperature. 
It also creates issues with the short term memory and recall functions of my brain, especially when I'm overloaded. 
Hence the necessity for Mandy, my assistant & friend, a desperate need for my google calendar, several reminders set on Alexa and a shit ton of grace. 
Lately it's the brain function I'm struggling with the most. It's embarrassing NOT to remember someone's name that I've worked with nearly everyday for 2 weeks. 
I mean I know it, but I can't pull the name to the front of my mind when I need it. Then 5 hours later it shows up when I don't.
I hide it well...until I don't and lately my #dysautonomia, #erythromelalgia and #POTS is showing. 
I've been at this long enough to know that it's time for some lifestyle changes.
Gotta let the Google job go, delegate, set reminders AND family vacation starts Friday!!!
At least I know what to do earlier in the game than I use to. I like to keep the suffering and whining to a minimum. 
I know what I can control. 
Btw...my daughter has it too. That's the worst.
Do you live with Chronic Illness?
What do you hide well?

Everyday I see the eyes that didn’t believe me or protect me. My own mother who now has dementia. For 3 years I was molested and beat up by her boyfriend that she choose to stay with. He would tell me he would kill her if I told. I was so afraid and one night I did tell because he was gone, I thought we could leave and I could protect her. However in telling her, she told me she didn’t believe me and I better not tell anyone. It continued. I thought for so long that i must be a bad person. Then he left her and she actually blamed me. She blamed me for her marriage failing because I was born to save it and now this. It’s been over a year since I’ve had her in the nursing home I work and it’s still hard to see in those eyes that didn’t protect me and yet I choose to bring her there to protect her. It’s not easy. Tonight I’m washing her clothes and reflecting on why?. But.. I’ve tried to stay positive and to those out there that don’t think they can, you can. You can CHOOSE to be the person you would want to be around. #metoo #metoomovement #choosetobehappy #stillcare #love

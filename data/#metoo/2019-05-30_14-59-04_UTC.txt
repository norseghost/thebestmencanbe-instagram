Don’t forget! This Saturday is our monthly UN Info Session! We are excited to welcome and host CouldYou? an organization working on combating the menstruation stigma across the globe, and providing women and girls with the feminine hygiene products they need. Not only will they be discussing WHAT the menstruation taboo is, you will hear HOW you can make a difference, staring in our local communities. RSVP is STILL open via our Facebook! •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

No longer only associated with war or veterans, we now know PTSD emanates from any real or perceived threat to oneâ€™s life or physical integrity. And the scars left behind are often invisible. But even invisible wounds are REAL!
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Awareness Month is dedicated to raising awareness about this life-long struggle and the people it affects, and how each of us can help make their lives just a little easier.

This time on Gathering Ground, I talk to Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation (CAASE) Executive Director, Kaethe Morris Hoffer. We discuss Kaethe's Quaker-rooted road to feminism, her experience in legislative advocacy, the #MeToo Movement, the vital work of CAASE, and of course, we answer a few of your questions! http://bit.ly/GG-E05

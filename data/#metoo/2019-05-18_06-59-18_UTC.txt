I didn’t make those posts and tell my entire ass story just so people would come to me and talk to me about it. I don’t ever want to think about that shit again. I told my shit so people would know they aren’t alone. Not so you people could come at me with shit. I understand you feel bad and pity me and “have my back” and “are there for me” but that’s not what this is about. Thank you to those of you saying that I inspired them and that I’m strong for speaking out but I’m still fucking terrified and traumatized so please for the absolute love of fuck do NOT bring that shit up to me. Don’t do it. You can tell me your shit you can send me “...” you can do whatever the hell else you want to do, don’t bring up MY shit to ME. Please.

We believe survivors. 
There have been many posts in the past week and weekend in reference to the Doximity article about the USC Cardiology Fellowship. We wanted stand in solidarity with the victims of sexual assualt. These women all took a moment to discuss what happened at USC and inspired us. We need to believe survivors. Sexual assault is not the same as sexual harassment, and neither has a place in medicine. It is time to support each other and believe each other. What happened at USC shouldn't happen again, and we shouldn't let it happen again. Thank you to the strong women that stood up for what was right and wrote these beautiful posts. 
We love you, and we support you. We get stronger together by lifting each other up. ❤️ #MeToomedicine #timesuphsc #metoo #women #womeninmedicine #womeninsurgery #doximity

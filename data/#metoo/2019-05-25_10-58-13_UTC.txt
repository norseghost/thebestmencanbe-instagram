"Heaven holds a place for those who pray... Hey hey hey!"

I've started a prayer group, 9.30am #churchonmuller, before the 10am service. 
I guess that makes me a bit #mrsrobinson , due to the lyrics and pics! 
But, in all fairness,  I wrote an insightful post and poem, then my phone lost power!? 'Dat you, Satan?', I whisper in the dark..? 'Do not speak to the prisoner.' My Lord replies. (I sometimes forget that part)... I see the prisoner. He's in a glass cage. Pacing; back and forth... with a big sign on his cage, stating:
'Do not speak to prisoner.
Ever. For any reason. Severe manipulation alert.' Unfortunately, being human, my pride kicks in. Satan makes me suffer. Hardcore. For as long as the Lord allows and. no longer!

Via this world's 'school of hurt' ....and  despite the pain and grief; regardless of the stigma & the #metoo movement... (pics to come; Thank you for your understanding and prayers.)
My new way, and the understanding I cling to; is beyond anything but complete and total reliance on God.
I put in my unaided, human effort to serve Him, but know that #thywillbedone.

Thankyou. In Jesus' Holy name....
May you turn to Jesus, as Lord. May you build a relationship with God. ðŸ˜‡

Amen

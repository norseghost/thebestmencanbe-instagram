Today we celebrate @mahoganycurls 💜
"Hi! My name is Jess and I am a mamapreneur. A mamapreneur is a female hustler, born to succeed, with dreams to fulfill and mouths to feed. 🙌🏾💕⁣
⁣
I started blogging 10 years ago and I had no idea that my platform would grow the way that it did. I just wanted to share my #naturalhairjourney with anyone that was willing to watch. ⁣
⁣
Fast forward to today, and my hobby is now a business. I still enjoy blogging and will be putting out new content very soon (stay tuned 😉). I’ve met amazing people and have partnered with some awesome brands. ⁣
⁣
I am grateful that I am able to do something that I love while supporting my family at the same time. "

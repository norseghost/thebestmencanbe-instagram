                        "text": "(Part 2 of 3)\nThis whole court process has given me a new level of respect and understanding for everyone who's dealt with shit like this, whether they won the case, lost, or couldnt even bring themselves to go through with it.. cuz it's even harder to go through than I ever imagined. I had no idea just how overwhelming this would be, and how heartless defense lawyers can be (not saying all) to the victim in cases like this. The amount of questions and details too was mentally draining, it was almost like going through it all over again.. I was asked things like what was the exact amount of shots I took that night, was it 5 or 6 or more or less? Was it vodka or rum? Were you wearing tights or pants or a skirt? Was your bra on or off? Which way was the bed facing in the room? Which side of the bed were you on? Were you laying on your back or your side? Was there any light in the room? Was he wearing a condom?.... That one really got to me, as if someone would be thinking about asking the man who just raped them, if he wore protection. That and the very last time I was on the stand, it felt like the defense lawyer attempted to trick me into saying the wrong thing on the final question.. I truly believe that everyone in that room knew that man was guilty, but the defense lawyer still did everything he possibly could to prove otherwise. Some of the things that were suggested and said to me, were just appaling. I knew right away after being asked the final question, that it was just the defense lawyers last attempt to win the case, confusing me on the final question while I'm already emotional and under a lot of pressure. I guess that's just their job but it's hard to not see people like that as being soulless monsters. \nContinued in next post...\n#metoo"

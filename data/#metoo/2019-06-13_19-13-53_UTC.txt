“In addition to his mysterious past life, Noah also struggled with nightmares and violent night terrors. I never told him how many times he tried to harm me when he was lost in his subconscious. There were three times when I was scared enough to fight back, and all of them occurred during the very beginning stages of our relationship. He was always a restless sleeper, but there were some days when he became a completely different person. I had no idea what set him off, how to avoid it or how to predict it.” -R.

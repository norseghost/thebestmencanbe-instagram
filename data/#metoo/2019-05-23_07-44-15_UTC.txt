What a whirlwind the past few days have been with all these FYC (For Your Consideration) Emmy events! Tonight’s was for @shrillhulu which is one of my favorite new TV shows. As a plus-sized woman, I am so moved by this brave, real story and @aidybryant honest portrayal. Seeing a woman of size as the lead of a show isn’t something that was possible until recent history and I am just so inspired by it. Watch the show. Trust me - it is so good! I got to meet Aidy tonight and she was just a love ❤️ I’m rooting for her for the Emmy!... And yesterday @indiewire outdid themselves with their beautiful first ever Consider This FYC brunch. @terrycrews hosted with so much energy and I lucked out with a seat at his table. How cool! Well, it gets better. I was thanking him for all he’s done to support the #metoo movement and even got to tell him about my movie #spintheplate that is about sexual abuse and is being released on Amazon soon. Lastly, I had the pleasure of attending the @netflix #graceandfrankie event recently, too! Hearing the legends at @officiallilytomlin , @janefonda, @martinsheenofficial1 , and @waterson_sam talk about their process during the Q & A was a real treat. Feeling blessed to be a part of this incredible industry and community! #actorslife #televisionacademy #emmyvoter #emmycontender #fyc #producer #writer #director #inspireworks #dreambig #entlabwarriors #plussizelove #netflixfysee

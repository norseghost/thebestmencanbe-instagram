#ImGoingPUBLIC üí™üèæ This Organization has enabled their Staff of every tier to engage in ALL types of #BadBehavior ON & OFF premises. A now ‚ùå "Friend" of mine encouraged me to apply for a job at the GoodWill Outlet, located very close to my home. I did & was WELCOMED with #SexualHarrassment, #Stalking, #Threats, #Retaliation, #Slander, #Suspension & finally #Termination.... ALL within 4 WEEKS. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
No #DEAttorney would/will accept the case (I üëÉüèΩPolitical Ties). So, I filed my claim personally at the #DEDEPTARTMENTOFLABOR, was eventually offered a "Mediation" where I rejected a $10,000 offer from the Goodwill, presented by the very people in Corporate who I believe are in co-hoots with hiring "seedy" characters to carry out their HIGH END STEALING SCHEME, which operates out the back & sides of the GRC. My "Girlfriend" who has known me since booking a #PleazureParty at its inception, seems to have given the hiring Manager & Director of my Department ALL the #Tea on my role as @thickandfitpleazure, my Marital woes, my jail stints, my love for #Bikelife, my interest in #guns & my use of Marijuana BEFORE my INTERVIEW. Here's the BEST PART: I have the reciept for my drug test, which HE TOOK against my will - I am a LICENSED #CanniCareDocs Client/User & told him that I did not need his help. I pray they can check the #DNA. I have the  #PHONERECORDS from two separate #'s & #SCREENSHOTS from him #harassing me via "Pleazures" FB page when I wouldn't answer my phones anymore. #LASTBUTNOTLEAST, as some of you know ALL of my calls are #RECORDED for #QualityAssurance... according to this #PositionStatement, he thinks I was joking, because I told him this before I hung up on him the night of my interview.

I have said all of this to convey to "Mr. J", "Mr. T" AND "Mr. M", to come clean to the Goodwill, their Lawyers, and most IMPORTANTLY YOUR WIVES, because I REMEMBER those minor details you've shared about ya NASTINESS & your TRIPS you tried to sway me with that my "Girlfriend" attends... I won't wait long.

I wrote this several years back about one of the 1st few people to love me unconditionally. He was clever, romance-book-cover attractive, powerful, soft spoken and compassionate. But, we parted ways because he tried and couldn't heal my trauma, and without healing, you cannot move forward in intimacy. I remember the curious and accusatory eyes of people who heard the news, but I'd rather them think the worst of me than of someone who gave me the greatest gift anyone has ever given me. He still does. But, as we begin to establish our own separate lives and relationships, our relationship continues to transition and the distance between us is gentle and healthy. But, @shaza.wajjokh ('s) art sometimes reminds me of that nameless despair that clutches you at pivotal moments. It's during those moments you desperately hope that in the end, it will still be a good story.

and then my bubble burst. The same bubble that you had helped me blow around me. It was when the day you left.
I still remember how heavily it rain that evening. As if the clouds were accompanying my eyes and the raindrops- my tears. I sat in 'our' favorite spot of 'our' apartment, playing our last conversation in me head, over and over again. The conversation that was enough to bring five years of our courtship to an end in just five minutes (or maybe less). But I also recollect how the lightning in the sky rekindled a spark in me. The spark that I have somehow managed to keep alive till date. The spark that made me realize that I do not 'need' you. The spark that lit up my path which looked dim, dark and dull for the wee hours after you left. The spark that made me believe that nothing except myself completes me. And the spark that taught me a life lesson that no matter how many times you feel broken, lost or shattered, you'll always emerge back as an whole- complete, and full of life. That's when I stopped wondering, "How can someone have the power to shatter you to dust- and also make you feel so whole?" because the power of 'Me' lies with 'Me' too.

This is what pitch black jungle filming and racket from a loose machine guns feels like - tunnel vision, dark and the occasional red light for a quick ‘where the fuck are we’. I actually intentionally use cameras that I know every button and adjustment by touch without needing light for night shooting. .
But for 5 minutes all I could hear through my headphones was our footsteps and clothing brushing between boots and torsos. That and the racket sound of a couple old shooting contraptions. I couldn’t see a damned thing other than shadows. The ultimate sense of focus and being on a mission. I also understand maybe only 6 words in Rukiga. The red light check was to pull me back into reality to prep myself for what we would film next. Momentarily backlit and visible to Matt.

 We’ll be releasing the official 1 minute trailer for Victors this week. The documentary premieres October 12th in Michigan and chronicles concepts within EDJA’s first years putting a stop to sexual assault and gender based violence in Nyakagezi Uganda.

Matt and I double shoot many of the real life scenes and he caught my silhouette right before I shut my headlamp off. We tried to shoot with ZERO input light from a production sense, I wore boots to protect my ankles and a dark hoodie to stay hidden. We hunted down two perpetrators this night thanks to Bosco, the police and members of the community coming forward. .
This is a pulled @mattstauble frame.

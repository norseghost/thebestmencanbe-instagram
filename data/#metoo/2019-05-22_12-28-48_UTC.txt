Some stills from a new play I am writing called GREY SPACE in response to the #Metoo movement. These guys did an absolutely amazing job presenting the work on Sunday in this script in hand performance. Thank you so much to my actors Lydia Gard @lydiajgard, Micheal Drake, Nancy Hall and Tom Briggs and our director Charissa Martinkauppi @chardamar for making it all happen. Also big thank you to #SPARK2019 and @tobaccofactorytheatres for having us and hosting the event! It was a very inspiring night filled with amazing new work.

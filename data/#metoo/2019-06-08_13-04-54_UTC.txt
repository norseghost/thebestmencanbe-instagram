In the African American community, there has always been a stigma associated with therapy and mental health. We are told to simply, “Get Over It” or “Pray about it”, and that’s what we did. We didn’t question our parents, we did as we were told. For most of us, we turned into adults unable to recognize anxiety/panic disorders, angry from unresolved conflicts etc etc. 
The Journey2Freedom starts with 1st recognizing the hindrance and then taking the necessary steps towards healing. 💚💕 #journey2freedom #womenempowerment #womeninspiration #mentalhealthawareness #personalblogs #inspirationalquotes #whyididntreport #metoo #therapy #anxiety #anxietyrelief #depression #depressionawareness #ptsd #ptsdawareness

First photo from my @tedx_glasgow talk today! Was so nervous before I spoke but once I stood on the red dot, I knew that it wasn’t about me talking but what it can do for whoever is listening. I’m passionate about speaking out to help end the shame, stigma and silence surrounding sexual violence. I am not my body or the things that were done to me and I am so much more than the sum of one night! None of us are broken beyond repair

“We are trading on the labour of survivors of violence. Having to tell our stories publicly is an undue burden put on women.  Don't be intimidated into telling your story publicly in order to advance the movement. (Think Brett Kavanaugh). Tell your story in a way that is powerful and meaningful so that it won’t be sensationalized.” the amazing Tarana Burke #MeToo  #WD2019 #ThePowerof Movements

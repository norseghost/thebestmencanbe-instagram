                        "text": "CW: domestic violence and assault against women .\n\n1 in 3 women have experienced domestic violence in Australia. On average, one woman a week is murdered by her current or former partner .\n\nI\u2019ve never aired this story .\n\nWhen I was 20, I was thrown across a room out of my on/off boyfriends way, after being kicked into the doorway. I was thrown like a rag doll, as I was in his way out of the room. My face landed on a windowsill and I lost my front teeth and broke my upper jaw .\n\nThere are lots of points that got to that, but it was a one sided physical attack that has left me tens of thousands in dental bills and a lifetime of \u201cissues\u201d .\n\nToday that man came into a pub I was sitting in. .\n\nI imagined that I would handle such a situation well. However, I had learned in years past that I was only the first of his victims of physical assault and not the last to lose their front teeth .\n\nI had been informed of various predatory ways of him interacting and dating women .\n\nThe person in my mind had become a terrifying monster .\n\nSo when I saw him. My body went into extreme fight it flight mode. In this instance, flight .\n\nI ran. I told my boyfriend we had to leave \u201cimmediately\u201d and bolted .\n\nI\u2019ve been beating myself up for not standing my ground. For allowing him to have power over me after all this time. I\u2019m unable to sleep. Lying terrified of a non existent boogeyman .\n\nWhy am I telling this story? This happened more than 15 years ago now. I reported the assault and was \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d to drop the charges by his family who were scared it would ruin his career and life. I have shouldered guilt, wondering if I\u2019d just been brave that other women may have been spared? .\n\nI\u2019m not the first person to say #metoo years later. We don\u2019t speak up when it happens because we are scared .\n\nBut you know what? Today I learned I\u2019m still scared. I wish I\u2019d spoken up and stood my ground 15 years ago. I support anyone who wants to come forward 1 day later or 10 years .\n\nI\u2019m here for you and understand. I have nothing but love for you .\n\nEven though it might feel like there is no one in the world \ud83d\udc93"

In nature, we go out to go within. 🍃💐🍂
✨
I’ve read that a series of psychological studies showed how spending time in quiet rural places, close to nature, builds greater attention span, strong memory, and helps reduce fear, stress, and anxiety. ✨
Not only that, but it’s great for the BOD, lowering blood pressure, heart rate, and muscle fatigue.  And it helps undo some of the junk the internet has done to our brain!  Yup, I could really use all that. How about you?

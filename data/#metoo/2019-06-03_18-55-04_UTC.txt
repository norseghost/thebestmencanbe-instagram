Last summer 250,000 people marched the streets to protest against Donald Trump. He’s here again and now we have to hear Tory leadership contenders buttering him up on the radio.
.
Since the 1980s 19 different women have come forward with stories about Donald Trump trying forcibly kissing them on their mouth, groping their buttocks, putting his hands on their breasts, putting his hand up their skirts, grabbing their genitals, walking in them changing clothes on purpose.
.
Can someone tell me how it is possible that a serial perpetrator of sexual assault and sexual harassment continues to get away with it for so long? How is it still possible to hide behind money and power when all this information is all in the public domain? So what’s it’s going to take for people to say enough? Donald Trump is the Harvey Weinstein of politics. And I haven’t even mentioned all the racism.
.
At 11am tomorrow Trafalgar Square we march again to #StopTrump.

This instagram page was inspired by Andrea Bower‘s artwork „Open secret“ in which she displayed large quantities of evidence of sexual harassment and assault by high-rolling men. Those men are the big fish whose exposure got the #metoo ball rolling. These occurrences are not unique to Hollywood, however, they are common day sources of angst and grievance for women in various contexts. All men who have committed these crimes against the female consciousness are to be held responsible.

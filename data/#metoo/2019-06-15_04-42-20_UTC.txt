I was looking at a picture of myself from last year and a friend walked up and said “that doesn’t even look like you.” My hair is the same color, my body size the same, smile is normal...what’s changed I ask? She couldn’t put her finger on it but she just ended up shrugging and said “you’re more confident now and it shows.” I have to agree 😉

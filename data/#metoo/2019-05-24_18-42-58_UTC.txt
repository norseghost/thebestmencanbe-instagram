Itâ€™s been a year since Harvey Weinstein was forced to step down from his film company due to rape/sexual misconduct allegations from dozens of women. The shamed movie mogul reached a $44 million settlement with his accusers. The money isnâ€™t coming from Weinstein, instead, an insurance policy. About $30 mill will go to the accusers, and the rest will go to Weinsteinâ€™s legal fees. Since he filed for bankruptcy last year, the settlement has to get approved by advisors who control Weinstein Co. Although heâ€™s settling, he still faces criminal charges and is due back in court in Sept. www.LOREALLUCHI.com ðŸ—½

Reposted from @7thstreetstyling -  So I didn't quite appreciate the way the video in the previous post was cropped from IGTV ðŸ¤·(. Check previous post if you haven't seen it yet)  might have to post separately here. .
Anyways here are the 3 looks clear for all to see. 
_____ 
Blazer from @ibukunnwoji 
All jewellery from @maroolarte 
Middle bag from @nofa_collections 
Wine bag from @evadinerobertlux 
Fascinator from @lolas_vintagestore 
___ 
P.S I see most people loved the tulle skirt and fascinator, my own fave is Sha the denim ( casual and simple ðŸ˜‹) - #regrann .

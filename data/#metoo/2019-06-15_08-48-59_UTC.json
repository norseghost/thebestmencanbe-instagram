And \u00a0I mean some BAD SHIT TROUBLES Be it harassment, gender inequality, discrimination, unjustified wage gap, forceful Marriage, \u00a0Majority Womenare targeted to honour killing, early Marriages, Jirga, wasted degrees (Because they aren't allowed to do jobs) \nDominancy just have different degrees but it exists everywhere. \nWe get subjected to many restrictions In the name of honour which has killed so many dreams all these decades. If you talk about equality and respect they'd often tell you, \u00a0we respect you cause you're a daughter, sister, mother etc is women is made to get respected for having a certain family tie? That's selfish. Respect them for who they are.\n\nRespect them as a person respects another person.\n\nSo feminism rose so many questions in minds of men, \u00a0like ; do they support homosexuality, \nAre they lesbians?\nDo they support nudity? \nDo they hate  men?\nis it about Inslaving men? \nThe uprise In crime rate, and reported harrasment cases #Metoo movements rose an outrage towards current condition of the country, questioning security of women in at home or in public.\nSo women spoke up about harrasment, sexual assault,  and even cyber bullying openly which Triggered not just men but even some women misunderstanding the whole concept and some even assume that Feminists support \"Nudity\" \nAlthough its basically about \"Not getting harrased and abused no matter what you wear\"  remember that those predator's eyes don't even spare a niqaabi/ Hijaabi \nThat's the concept\nSome believed it's about \u201csnatching\" freedom and demanding dominancy \nwhich is never the case.\n\nThat's Completely WRONG.\n\nWomen struggle, Fight is for their own Rightful Justified space in society, Economic Rights, Educational rights, Gender Equality, Freedom of choice, Right to work, Equal wage, Lawful Property Security leading to Empowerment.\nAlthough Islam gives women more perks then men but our culture/ traditions are just in denial..\nSo? \nWould u call yourself a feminist? \nTag an Anti-Feminist \ud83d\ude02!\n#Feminism #Pakistanelite"

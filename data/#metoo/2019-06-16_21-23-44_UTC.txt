In senior kindergarten, there was a boy in my class named Ricardo. ⁣
One day he ran up to me and kissed me on the cheek. I didn’t like it.⁣
Then, minutes later, he approached me again and kissed me right on the lips. It was so gross. I hated it. ⁣
Another time, we were all sitting on the carpet as our teacher read a story to us. I felt the zipper on the back of my dress being pulled down. It was Ricardo, unzipping my dress. He exposed my back, kissed me on it, and then zipped my dress back up. It felt awful. My body went cold.⁣
My hand shot straight up to tell the teacher, but she scolded me for interrupting the story and told me to wait until she was done.⁣
I ended up not saying anything at all.⁣

17yrs ago my high school had written me off as a lost cause. The majority of my “friends” said I wasn’t going to amount to anything; and all I could think to myself as I graduated from high school was “how am I going to take care of him and do better by him?” I did ok for the most part. My (ex) husband and I did our best and we had incredible family and friends that supported us. The military moved me around and so many big life things happened but we survived. And I held myself together because today was Cody’s day... up until we were driving back from graduation. It was all I could do not to be a sobbing mess while trying to deal with the traffic driving home. He is my oldest. My heart. He and I practically had to grow up together. I couldn’t be more proud of him now though. He wants to be a psychologist and is even wanting to work with me doing art therapy. So I figure we must have managed to do something right because he wants to now give the next generation a better world too. © Ronni Knepp, 2019

Today, I am honoring & remembering one of the bravest little girls I ever knew & fought for. She has taught me bravery, fight, but stillness, and softness, sass & the right be stubborn & selfish. She is a warrior & a survivor. Her flames are used to illuminate her world but her fire is used to remind forest that even the biggest tree can be brought down by the wisps of her flames. #tbt #Xunantunich #stonewoman #lilgirls #power #strength #flowers #bloom #nectar #liveauthentic #speaklife #protect #children #metoo #blacktourmaline #apachetears #citrine #Amethyst #livingthedream

Gucci's Cruise 2020 collection, which took place at Rome's Capitolini Museums, is all about women empowerment. In an interview with WWD, the brand's Creative Director Alessandro Michele said the show is a "'hymn to freedom' . . . that allows him to express his belief in the idea of self-determination and gender equality.  #abortion #fashion #gucci #metoo #womensright

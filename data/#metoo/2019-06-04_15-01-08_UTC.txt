This is one of the hardest things I’ve ever written. It’s not easy reliving a painful season of your past. 
I’ve been afraid so long to click submit on this article, to share my story of how I was put in a situation of which I was sexually assaulted and forced to do things that no 15 year old (or any age) should have to go through. 
This is my story, this is my secret and for ANYONE going through this, or has gone through this, please understand I’ve been there, reach out, talk to someone because you matter, your worth more than what that person did to you. 
Special thank you to @terrycrews - his words inspired me to take this next step to start writing this.

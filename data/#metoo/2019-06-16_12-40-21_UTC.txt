Changing rape culture is something I’m particularly passionate about although I know there is more I can do. I have never been to a rally or protest but this movement means a lot to me. Rape prevention techniques I discovered when I was about 14/15 and even then I was shocked about how the responsibility was put on the potential victims. - Don’t dress that way
- Don’t drink that much
- Have a buddy system
Etc etc
So if you don’t follow the rules it’s somehow your fault? Are you a slut? Did you deserve it?...BULLSHIT!

Although I think some safety precautions have their place, there was never any onus on the criminal and to this day it isn’t all the way there. We’ve all heard the “it shouldn’t ruin the life of a young mans with so much promise” 🤮

As I grew up I understood more about the cruel sexually violent history against women (and men), I learned about consent and what that means and how convoluted that can become when there is someone who is so focused on getting what they want they fail to see what’s in front of them. You do not have a right to anyone. If someone is drunk af and they say yes...it doesn’t matter. Their judgement impaired. That is not consent. If they still want to have sex with you when they’re sober and have all their faculties...go for it!

Education and understanding around consent should be an important part of a child’s life. The same as respect for yourself and for others, no matter how that person identifies. .

If you think something has happened to you, talk to someone. There are people out there who can help and understand what you’re going through xxx

I drew this myself but it is not watermarked for a reason. I didn’t feel right putting it on. The message belongs to everyone so please feel free to share it as much as you want xx

six months ago i arrived in this loft in north west london after a very hard period of my life ... i was tired , very sick ... the doctor suspected i had a cancer ..but i fought hard against all the negativity brought in my life by an abusive man and his restricted circle of racist and dirty friends ... i worked hard and met fantastic people ..but i was not happy in london anymore and decided to move towards a carismatic but quieter city called bristol ... today i m moving all my staff to bristol and in a few days i will leave the capital and my loft for ever with all its painfull past .. so happy now  and proud of myself .. never say never ..fight for your self respect and get the best from the only one life your mother gave to you .. talk  tonight .. the van man is here ðŸ˜€

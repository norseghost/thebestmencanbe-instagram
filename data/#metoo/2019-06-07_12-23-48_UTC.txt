I have thought long and hard about this. Why do we feel like we need closure? But more importantly, why do we think we need anyone to apologize or explain things to us?*
*
Why aren’t we looking inside ourselves and reconciling that we made the choices we made because that was what we wanted at the time (and if we don’t agree with those choices, we move on knowing we will make better choices), understand that things went down the way they did because everything happens exactly when it is supposed to happen, and meditate through it all, cutting cords, and embracing love. *
*
Instead we let our ego lead us, listening to our ego tell us that this breakup somehow confirms every awful thing we have ever felt about ourselves to be true. It’s not. All it means is that she/he was meant to be in your life for the time they were in your life, in the way they showed up. Period. Now it’s time to get on with living and having experiences and reflecting so that you grow and spiritually evolve. *
*
We only need closure when we show up with our ego first because your ego will always find a way to show you you’re right about every false belief you have about yourself. *
*
Self love and a deep awareness of self worth helps this. Connection to your spiritual side helps this. Meditation helps. Working out helps. Affirmations help. *
*
Getting into another relationship to prove to yourself and the world around you that you’re loveable doesn’t help. Sitting in front of someone who treated you like garbage while they tell you the laundry list of what’s wrong with you doesn’t help. *

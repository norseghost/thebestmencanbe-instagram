He promised to take me paragliding but first he parked in an empty lot and took more of my soul away. Crumpled clothes and dreams; it wasn't supposed to be this way. The lies we both carried, suffocating my heart. That smile. That empty fucking smile hiding the rape that happened fifteen minutes before and as I ran towards the cliff I silently prayed to die. Just let this pain end; I cant endure anymore. As I glided through the air tears stung my eyes and I choked down the sobs, until I couldn't. The instructor told me to breathe believing I was having a panic attack from the height. His voice calm and soothing only made me cry harder. I wanted to tell him. I wanted him to see me, to save me but not even my Mother protected me so who was I to think a stranger would? So I swallowed the secrets once again and let the tears fall.

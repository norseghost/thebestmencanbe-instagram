Itâ€™s a day of reflection for me and I want to share some of my earliest work. This performance piece is probably my favourite work from my Uni days when I was just a baby.

I sewed myself into a cocoon of fabric that I had dipped in beeswax so it looked fleshy. What I failed to know is that it would be difficult to breathe but luckily my audience filed into the room as soon as I was ready. It was my intention to tear myself out of that cocoon it just happened to be that I had to do it hard and fast so I could gasp for air. 
There was a knife on the ground that I had placed and I took it to tear the other pieces that I had arranged around the room that were filled with earth, leaves and sticks. 
In brief, it was a piece about fierce liberation. I fell in love with performance art and I had big ambitious dreams but in time I had made a different path. Today I look back at my artistic path and wonder how I can return to those roots. .

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has started her hunt for the “traitor” within the party after the BJP took the lead in 129 assembly segments. The fact that the saffron party lost by less than 4,000 votes in another 60 assembly segments makes the trend more worrying for the Trinamool Congress, said sources in the TMC ranks. At least 192 assembly segments have been identified as ‘troubled zones’, mostly in North and western Bengal.

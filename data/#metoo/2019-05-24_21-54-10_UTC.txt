super super late post BUT ya girl has been published!! In fall 2017 I conducted a content analysis in the midst of #MeToo to interpret how social media (i.e. Twitter) is used in social movements to collect perspectives & create offline effects. If you are interested in reading my study there is a copy in the KU Comm. Studies office or DM me! This was a MAJOR goal of mine and I canâ€™t wait to see my name in paper again. If youâ€™re a communication scholar and would like to collab on some independent studies hit me up ðŸ˜Ž

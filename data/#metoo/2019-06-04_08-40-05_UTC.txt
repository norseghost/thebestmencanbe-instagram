Will you speak up? If you have been watching on in shock/disgust/confusion* as the anti-abortion acts are being passed and have not known if or how to step up against it (you know, there's that big pond separating us) here is one simple way to: make a sign and come hang out with fellow-protesters at one of the many anti-Trump demonstrations across the UK. *your version of not pleased at all

#Repost from @toomuchmotheringinformation "Tuesday's march is not just an anti-Trump demonstration. It's also a chance to publicly reject the politics he embodies but which are not just limited to him. Politics of division and hatred; politics based on lies and funded by corruption; politics that do NOT *represent* the concerns of ordinary people - it twists and exploits them to serve its own agenda. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

America is not the only country grappling with these forces and we do not have to acquiesce... For a long time I listened to people who told me my hope was naive or deluded. Now I can see my belief that things *can* be better deserves to be given space and power. Those who seek to demean me for it just want me to be quiet, but #ichoosehope.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

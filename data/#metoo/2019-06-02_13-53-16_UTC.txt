Just opened my email to find out The PowerFem Voice Podcast is a finalist in CMA Awards 2019. This is huge and I’m incredibly proud even to be a finalist. Many of you know this podcast was created by overcoming many barriers for me so to be recognised for that is out of this world. The category is sponsored by the amazing Brian Fanzo (I was watching this dude on #Snapchat 4 years ago and still follow him) and is called “Press The Damn Button”. You can read about it here. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

I’d love to see who the other finalists are for all the categories so I’m keeping an eye on the website

Alright ya'll guys. Its been 7 years since my #metoo story. 7 might seem like an insignificant number to you, but it takes 7 years for the cells in your body to replace themselves. That means for the first time since I was 17 I have a body that he didnt touch. That's a big deal, so ya'll guys if it happened to you I'm extremely sorry. Trust me when I say I get it, and I see you. You are beautiful, you are strong, and you ARE worthwhile. Much love -Allykins

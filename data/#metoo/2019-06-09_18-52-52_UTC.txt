It’s been 9 months and 8 days since the first time I was sexually assaulted. Flashbacks, panic attacks, and nightmares became my new normal. The trauma I was facing unfortunately wasn’t the worst part about it all though. The worst part about that incident was the fear of not being believed. The man that did it, a senior in high school, whom I do not care to name got away with it. He managed to abuse tons of girls (sexually and mentally). I remember one of the first person I told had asked me what I was wearing. My immediate reaction wasn’t it doesn’t matter what I was wearing because my clothing doesn’t determine consent. Instead I felt guilt and confusion. I didn’t want to be telling my story if the person that did it never actually messed up. If you have been sexually assaulted, it’s not your fault. I understand the confusion you might be feeling. The guy that did it was a friend of mine at the time. It’s confusing how someone I thought I could trust was such a deeply sickened individual. For those who have been sexual assaulted, I stand with you. I believe you. Your voice matters. #metoo

My therapist told me this earlier this year and I promise I’m taking it to my grave:
•
‘If someone cant tell you what you did wrong or what the problem is, it is none of your business.’
•
I had the habit of automatically accepting blame when I noticed a change in someone’s behavior. I’d assume I did or said something wrong. She put an end to that immediately.

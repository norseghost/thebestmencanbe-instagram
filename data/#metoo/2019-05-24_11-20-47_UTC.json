Although the corporate entity surely has policies and training on this, it comes down to each franchise licensee to do what is right. They need to up their game obviously.

But because your job was on the line no one spoke up. If you have ever read any autobiography\u2019s, memoirs or biography\u2019s of early Hollywood actors you might be shocked of what they suffered. The major studios had \u201cfixers\u201d that would take the problems with their major stars and hide it from the press etc to maintain their appearance as a good clean company and all the staff including the big wigs of the company were also good clean moral people. But many actresses were raped, some would end up pregnant and they had these fixers that would clean the issue up. But due to wanting to keep their job many people never spoke up. And it\u2019s a story all too familiar. I watched a show about one of the first female pilots to fly commercial planes. She had been a flight attendant first, and she talked about all the harassment she faced as a flight attendant. Porn magazines hidden everywhere, the pilots grabbing them, the passengers grabbing them and they had to just continue on with a smile. They had to have a certain height requirement and weight. They would get weighed before shifts etc. it was some awful stuff. I think more can and should be done and I hope these complaints are taken seriously and they do something about it!",

Not only in sexual harassment, but hiring and promotion. A high percentage of Government Contractors (traditionally a highly male dominated ex-military industry looking back 30 years ago) now have women CEOs. Totally support MeToo, TimesUp etc, however \"Hollywood\" is one of last areas where harassment permeates(ed) the organizations.  Small - Med sized companies have also made great strides. In large metro cities, you just don't see bias based hiring. It is there, but the exception. Harassment in all forms should never be tolerated. Think we have work to do, but not as bad as sometimes reported. I owned a large recruiting company for two decades. The FIRST thing everyone learns in training and orientation (at all levels) is discrimination harassment laws, why they are so important, and how to handle any such \"orders\" by clients (very rare but ultimately if we couldn't educate potential clients on why not to do that, we flat out declined to work with that company, no matter how large the potential). Those situations were 1 in 100 though. We all have obligation to operate straight-up and ethically. Setting up organizational practices that have protective policies AND training on such that clearly communicate zero tolerance starts everything in right direction.",

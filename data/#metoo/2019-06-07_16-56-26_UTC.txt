A seven-minute video titled “I’m also a victim of sexual assault,” in which four women and a man spoke to the camera about their stories, was produced by a group of people who started the #HereForUs hashtag in China as a way to support victims of sexual harassment and assault.

The video has been viewed nearly 700,000 times on Weibo. But when The New York Times reached out to interview them, they refused. They worried that their appearance could anger the Chinese government and get their hashtag censored.

Alex Chang, who is one of them, was hosting an online program WeZeit Love which stopped updating due to multiple reasons.

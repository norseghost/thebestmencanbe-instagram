We all have masculine energy, when we are in a profound contact with our feminine side we can feel when we need to speak or act in congruency with the holy spirit and we put judgement out of our intersection with others we can sense when the Holy Spirit speaks and drive people to act. There is no need for control , the need is to serve, complete and add the missing part to the hole. This constant observation is a mystic kind of romance with the spirit. We come to serve  this observation constantly to recognize the voids of energies coming out from the feminine in us or others. So there is no need for competition it’s fun game of hiding and seek the spirit and honoring the flow of abundance that comes to integrate our life with the hole creation and show us our responsibility in the process. Fluidity with creation and relationships is the integration of this essence to manifest our feminine and masculine working together to bring our circle to nonjudgmental force of fierce service to the next generations. With common sense it’s obvious there is a clear imbalance that benefits patriarchy over the hole feminine in these world. Men need to stand up for women and also for other men as a sacred vulnerable souls with a committed inteligente to bring the circle together for the hole universal benefit of feminine and masculine consciousness. #divinefeminine #patriarchy #metoo #writing #conciousness #manhood #theredpill #warriors #communication #commonsense #women #family #love #radio

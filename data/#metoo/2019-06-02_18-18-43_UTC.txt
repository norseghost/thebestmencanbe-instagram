NOTHING MORE ANNOYING WHEN CIS MEN TRY TO DERAIL FEMALE, TRANS, AND NON-BINARY PEOPLE'S ISSUES BY BRINGING UP PROBLEMS THAT CIS MEN EXPERIENCE.

E.g. *woman speaks about female rape victims* Man: 'but what about false accusations of rape, what about Male rape victims?' *woman speaks about abortion or womens birth control* Man: 'but why shouldnt the father get a say'

IF YOU REALLY CARED ABOUT MEN'S ISSUES THEN YOU WOULD CHANNEL THAT ENERGY AND CREATE A PAGE FOR MEN'S PROBLEMS! STOP DERAILING PROBLEMS THAT HAPPEN TO THE MOST OPPRESSED IN SOCIETY BY STEALING THE CONVERSATION AWAY FROM THEM! CIS MEN LITERALLY HAVE A VOICE IN EVERY POLITICAL ARENA IN THE WORLD UNLIKE WOMEN, TRANS AND NON BINARY. SO VOICE YOUR CONCERNS IN SPACES YOU ALREADY HAVE.

“Stop the rhetoric that a woman is crazy or difficult,” Portman insisted. “If a man says a woman is crazy or difficult, ask him, ‘What bad thing did you do to her?’ That’s a code word. He is trying to discredit her reputation,” she said.
She continued, “If any group you are part of only has people that look like you, change that group. Be embarrassed if everyone in your workplace looks like you.” Natalie Portman .

Itâ€™s a beautiful thing to know that with God anything is possible. Even getting out of a situation of abuse and bondage. You canâ€™t even begin to explain to anyone how you ended up in such a dark place. You canâ€™t even begin to tell the mixed emotions in your heart. The love for your abuser, shame for what theyâ€™ve done to you, and guilt for it happening. Well itâ€™s not your fault for loving someone unconditionally. It is their fault for their actions towards you. Speak up. Get away. Stay away. No more abuse. God is amazing. Trust His promises, no weapon formed against you will prosper. EVER!

Click link in bio for preview of book.  The Art of Silence, is a self-help book that utilizes both fictional and actual accounts to address the painful and silent epidemic of domestic abuse, rape and low self-worth.  This timely book masterfully interweaves diary entries, of two women who experienced not only an inward pain, but also fought through public humiliations, and degradation that the horrors of those abuses bring. Through this experience, they learn that these painful experiences are far from silent, as they sacrifice not only the comforts of life, but sadly the very sanity of everyone involved.

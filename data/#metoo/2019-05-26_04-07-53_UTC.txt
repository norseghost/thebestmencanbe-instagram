The time has come for me to begin expanding the journey of acknowledging my own depression, anxiety, and mental disease. This will grow slowly, but I need you as much as you may need help. Let’s build together. #depressionhelp #depression #black #lgbtq #queer #metoo #suicideprevention #suicideawarenessmonth #suicideawarness #pray #praythegayaway ....more to come! Until then WE GOT THIS! If you need immediate help please reach out first to The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline ‭1 (800) 273-8255‬.

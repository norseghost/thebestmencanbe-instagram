Go see my bestie @nlgreenwalt’s latest work for @coriolisdance ”Danses des Cygnes” THIS WEEK,  June 6-9 @velocity_seattle. We share many dancers between our companies so you know it’s going to be stellar! Danses des Cygnes is a contemporary feminist re-telling of Swan Lake that explores the power dynamics at play in the ballet, expressing the abuse of Odette but ultimately telling a story of female empowerment and community. #metoo #swans #feminist #seattledance #femalechoreographers PC @bretdossphoto

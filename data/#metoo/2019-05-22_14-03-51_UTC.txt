“If only you had listened to us, none of this would have happened.” WHISPER NETWORK takes place within the walls of Truviv, Inc. The CEO dies suddenly, leaving the position open to Ames. But Ames is a much more complicated man than he lets on, and rumors and secrets begin to fly.

Four women have worked at Truviv, Inc. for years. Their concerns about Ames have repeatedly fallen of deaf ears, until now. Sloane, Ardie, Gracie and Rosalita set forth a chain of events that will impact everyone at Truviv, including them.

Since I heard about this novel, I have been eager to read it. It seems timely, given the prominence of the #MeToo movement echoing across the globe. I can’t wait to get started and share my review with all of you!

Special shout out to @_luna_reads for the ARC!

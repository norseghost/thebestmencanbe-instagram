Another bag delivered!  This one was picked up by one of our volunteers and delivered to a new 27 week baby girl and her family in YYC. *
*
We make 152 bags over Christmas alone for families in the YYC NICUâ€™s. Plus the bags that are requested throughout the year. We have incredible volunteers that not only make things for the bags, but also help us collect donations from the community. *
*
Have a suggestion for something to be added to the bag they we may be missing? *

Remember multiple months ago when I posted a video on IGTV about there being a lack of substance in today’s  culture. Then proceeded to delete all of my posts and never log into Instagram again.? #metoo 
Throughout that time, redirection was not on my conscious I was just going about life, overacting about things, not feeling much, and definitely just simply living. However a few months after I posted that video life changed and “just going through the motions” left the list of options. 
Once that occurred I landed at a point where I was just like “ I’m not going to kms but I really wouldn’t mind life being over right now” ( this got deep fast but I promise you it tyes into my point) I was just genuinely over it and I ran through the typical storyline of life and just thought about how “bad” things are guaranteed to happen along the way and I just didn’t see the point. 
However, throughout this time I spent more time with God. Read the Bible in my free time, listened to Christian music 25/8 and watched sermons.. FOR FUN 😳( Specifically @wearetransformation ) . It was the only thing giving me peace when literally 𝓮𝓿𝓮𝓻𝔂𝓽𝓱𝓲𝓷𝓰 seemed useless. And eventually, birthed out of that situation came tbhTochi. 
tbhTochi the teen girl who wants to help other teens in a world which has no sure sense of direction. tbhTochi who’s still learning but now wants to share what she has learnt. tbhTochi who’s realized that she maybe the answer to a generation of teens who are fleeing Christ simply from a lack of representation of those who are not. To be Honest. Tochi.

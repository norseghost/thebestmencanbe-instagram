#RamadanReminder: During the month of Ramadan, the doors of mercy are opened for us, and in turn we should open this door for others around us. People who display compassion to others will be shown compassion by The Most Compassionate. So open your arms and soften your hearts to practice forgiveness, generosity, and compassion towards others. ü§≤üèΩ

When God formed us, He gave us the innate ability to think for ourselves. 
He didn’t create us to be robots that wander the earth singing His praises day in and day out. 
No, He gave us the gift of free will and free thinking. From the moment we are conceived, our brains begin to develop, and we begin forming belief systems based off what we are experiencing. 
But because we live in a fallen world. I don’t think that there is a single person who has gone through their entire childhood without experiencing some sort of hurt and rejection. Each life experience gives us the opportunity to form thoughts and belief systems. 
For example, if you’ve lived your entire life thinking that you are a failure or a disappointment, you are going to live as though you are a failure and a disappointment!

This is just one instance…our minds have so much bearing on what our future outcomes in life will be…good or bad.

In this week’s blog, I’m going to share with you, how you can take control of your mind, and ultimately, take control of your life!

The news coming out of #Sudan is absolutely devastating.
.
Doctors believe paramilitaries carried out more than 70 rapes during an attack on a protest camp in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, a week ago.
.
More than 100 people were killed and as many as 700 injured in the attack last Monday. There are widespread reports of sexual violence, mass arrests, gunfire in medical facilities and bodies floating in the river Nile. .
.
We #standwithsudan and call on the 
UK government to help protect the vulnerable populations who are going through unimaginable violence.

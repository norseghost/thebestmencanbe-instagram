Itâ€™s so important that when a survivor sits down and wants to open up that you actively listen, donâ€™t interrupt, and keep an open heart and mind. You can never understand their experience but you can show compassion as they confide in you. Know the resources available for them, but donâ€™t make them feel like youâ€™re trying to pass off what theyâ€™ve just told you.

THE LIFE CYCLE OF A “WOMAN”:
One day in your early 20’s, you wake up, and for the first time in your entire life, you feel validated: suddenly there is a stage on which to speak and be heard as you never have known before. 
This attention and desire grows to the point that people are FIGHTING for the chance to just TALK to you. Then someone in the growing crowd succeeds in winning over your heart: they believe in you, they hang on your every word, and they validate you so well that no amount of flaws you have could ever undo their undying support in everything that you are and aspire to be. 
You never needed anyone to validate you before, but this love turns all fear of self-doubt into security and empowerment: it feels like self-actualization for the first time in your life.

Before too long, however, you realize this love is based on some “appeal” you can’t seem to keep living up to- because you were in ”high-demand” at some imaginary marketplace you don’t yet understand. 
You repeat this pattern a few more times before you uncover the fact that it is a cycle. 
Every time you find personal freedom, someone swoops in and has to ”take you off the market”. One day when you’ve had enough, you stop buying into being the “cash cow” on the stage before a room full of salesmen, and your sparkly “youthful” eyes are traded in for more cynical, experienced ones. 
So now the experience of learning our perfectly human inability to live up to the painfully unrealistic roles projected on us by “marketplace” standards gets us shoved to the outskirts of the room for the younger, more “impressionable” models that are “still on the market”. Because they still have a sparkle of naïveté in their eyes that doesn’t yet realize that what makes them “special” and worth listening to will dissipate with wisdom and experience. 
Invalid is the woman who understands the system of this deceptive place and refuses to eagerly offer herself up again and again by pouring hours of her week into looking a certain way so that her words could ever hold any weight.

LISTEN TO US WITH YOUR HANDS OVER YOUR EYES🙈

Nearly 11 million women in the United States have been raped while drunk, drugged, or high (CDC). ⠀
This is the unfortunate reality. Rapists use alcohol and drugs to subdue their victims so often. The problem starts and ends with rapists – NOT having drinks with friends. However, we can all keep each other safe if we pay attention to each other’s drinks. Watch your friend’s drink when they go to the bathroom, don’t lose sight of your own drink, and stand up for people you think are being taken advantage of. We all deserve to have a good time – lets make that happen. 🍹🍸🍻🍾🍷🥃🥂🍺✨⠀

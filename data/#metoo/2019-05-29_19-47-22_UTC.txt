Natacha Rambova, Dancer-turned-costumer-turned-art director for Alla Nazimova films CAMILLE (1921) and SALOMÉ (1923). Nazimova met Rambova delivering costume sketches supposedly by Théodore Kosloff. When the star asked for a change, however, Rambova took a pencil and altered the drawing on the spot, revealing herself to be the true creator of the designs credited to her lover.
Soon Rambova would leave Kosloff and rumors of a lesbian affair between Nazimova and Rambova arose – just like for any two creative and independent women who collaborate and openly admire each other almost 100 years later.

Posted @withrepost • @lifecontinuesafter Visit the Words post from July to read ‘The Importance of Terry Crews’. “I wanted these survivors to know that I believe them, I supported them and that this happened to me too,”. Thank you @terrycrews for being proactively good and helping survivors in their fight for justice with @risenow.us @thejhf & @amandangocnguyen ❤️

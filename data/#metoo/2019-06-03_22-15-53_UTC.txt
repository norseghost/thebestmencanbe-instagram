Whether you are a new mom, have 10 kids, never had postpartum, are still in the thick of it, have hormone issues, anxiety, anything you have to look at all you have already overcome.  And know that you have more strength inside yourself then you can even imagine. 
When I was in the worst of it, I never wanted to harm myself, but just woke up every day and counted the minutes until bedtime.  Every single day was a struggle.  A real mental, emotional, physical struggle to just be.  Hearing “this too shall pass” or “I’ve been there and it will get better” offered little or no comfort.  But looking back now I cannot believe what I went through on a daily basis.  I remember multiple times when I thought I wouldn’t survive, and I did.  Time and time again.  I’m a better person for it and now I know how strong I am.  And you are too 💪

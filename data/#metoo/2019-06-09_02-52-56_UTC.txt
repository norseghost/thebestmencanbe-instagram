Hello, I’m Gigi and I am a survivor.

I hope that by sharing my insight here, others will find their voices too.

The statistics of abuse are staggering. Even more so when you consider that a significant number of people never talk about what happened to them.

I’m here to tell you, whether you “talk” or not, you are wanted here.

You are safe here.

You are loved here.

It’s #NEVER okay to #Ever hit a #woman these are just some of the #bruises I ended up with after I saw my #last  #exboyfriend and that doesn’t even account for the endless #rude #emails and #harassment #messages I have gotten over the cycle of us #dating ...also not shown is what he did to my #head and slapping me across the face. It actually hurts to open my mouth and jaw. I #never post stuff like this on my Instagram..but I have never been hurt like this and I have been gaslighted..I have never been with someone who made me think I was crazy ...he even created more fake numbers to get in contact with me to call me those names. It’s quite embarrassing for me to post this. #metoo

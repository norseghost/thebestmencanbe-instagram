A few years back I lost a lot of weight, not by choice, I dropped down under 90lbs. It was a scary time in my life but on the outside I tried to make it appear like everything was fine - it wasn‚Äôt. I was in a very toxic relationship, every day dealing with manipulation, lying, possessive behavior, emotional, mental and sometimes physical/other abuse that I am still not completely comfortable talking about. I was living in constant fear and trauma that took a toll on my physical and mental health, I lost myself. I still don‚Äôt go out as often due to remaining fears, I still have trauma, I‚Äôm still healing. Thankfully I got out, I got better - And I am so grateful - to my body for being stronger than I was, my friends (the ones who stuck by me/& the ones who didn‚Äôt) and fought for me when I couldn‚Äôt fight for myself, my family who love me unconditionally who have & will always be there (not everyone is as lucky), therapy, meditation, yoga - the works, to meet someone so lovely & kind - who never judged me - who is supportive & loving - who pushes me - who helps me heal & grow - who is patient with me - who shows me what love actually feels like, and me for getting through it all & continuing to - ‚Äúsomewhere there is a past you overflowing with so much pride looking at how far you‚Äôve come.‚Äù üíï *I believe survivors, I believe you.

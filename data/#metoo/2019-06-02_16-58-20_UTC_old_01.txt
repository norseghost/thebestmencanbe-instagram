*Book Review*
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
@theapology 
By: @eveensler 
I cannot entirely personally relate to this book, but I’m sure so many can, which makes it that much more upsetting and important. In the midst of the #metoo movement, at a time when our worth as women is constantly questioned and our rights are put in jeopardy, this is the book we need. It’s short yet deep, ugly yet brave, and it’ll grab your heart, break it, and return it even stronger.

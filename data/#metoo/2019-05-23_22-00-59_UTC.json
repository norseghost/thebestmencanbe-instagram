It's not easy at all.\n\nMental illness is physically and mentally draining, your body constantly in fight and flight mode screening everyone who could be a potential threat to you. \nJust Be kind to people and quit the judgement everyone is fighting a battle that from an outsider's point of view may not seem much but is life crippling for them and judgement and stigma does not help."

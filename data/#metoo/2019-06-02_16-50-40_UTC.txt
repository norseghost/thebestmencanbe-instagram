This one of the first weekends where I don't have a million things planned. 
I am getting better at this concept of not "hustling" or "wasting my time". Yes, I have books to edit. 
Yes, I have homework to complete. 
Yes, I have a business to market and a newsletter to write. 
But, 
Treating those things as somehow worth more than my personal peace is not how I can function. 
I need a weekend to rest and recover too. 
I need a weekend to: 
Slow 
Down 
And 
Take 
Care. 
And so do you. 
Now, excuse me while I fall into a new book.

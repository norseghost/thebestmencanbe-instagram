Had a discussion last night with a well meaning gentleman about how scary it is to be a woman. It was actually about the fact that I said that I paid my way for a trip I took with someone when I was in my early 20's. My reasoning was that I didn't want the guy I was going with to have any expectations of a physical nature so we split the costs and therefore, because my budget was limited, our activities were limited. My gentleman thought it was BS that people have that way of thinking, that some of us feel that if we are given something, we have to give something back...that give and take has to be 100/100, tit for tat. It is scary to be a woman because that IS how some men feel. He just didn't understand why people feel that way and that was my point exactly. They shouldn't feel that way. But some men do and that's why it is scary to be a woman. Taking small bits of control, like paying your own way, is one of the ways we can attempt to protect ourselves. We shouldn't have to but we do have to. ðŸ’” #rapeculture #metoo

Part 2/2 TRIGGER WARNING**** When I finally crawl back into my bed, well past the bed time of a 6 year old's, I would pull Guy to me and place his face under mine and cry. I wouldn't make a sound except small, unheard gasps for air. I remember clutching the bottom of his shirt, one of the pom poms between my thumb and forefinger. I clung onto it for dear life and poured my pain out. He absorbed all of it, it's amazing the paint on his face isn't more faded. I brought him everywhere I went. Every foster home, every new house, everywhere. 
He lives on the shelf up in my closet now. Not because he is a toy I have put away, never to be played with again. Not because I have grown up and become a real adult but because I no longer need my guy to keep me safe. I am safe. I am no longer living in fear. I am no longer a victim, but a thriving, surviving, fucked, but strong individual. I'm ok. I have my tribe to help wipe away my tears.

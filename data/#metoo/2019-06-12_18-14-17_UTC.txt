Review: *Possible spoilers ahead on novel's themes*

Does bookstagram really need another glowing review of this book of the moment?

Possibly not but I wanted to talk about why it has struck a cord with readers and I think it’s because although it is a sweet and uplifting read, it tackles some really important topics in a safe and relatable way.
.
Everyone goes through tough times in their lives, and I think this book - and the support the characters receive from each other and friends - is what we would all love to have. That closeness, that bond.
.
The main characters, Tiffy and Leon, feel real. They’re not airbrushed perfection (I love how Tiffy is described as being ‘big’ however this isn’t mentioned too much, it’s just part of who she is so doesn’t feel patronising and isn’t overplayed) and Leon isn’t the perfect hero.
.
I’m sure most got caught up in what was happening with Tiffy and Leon, but honestly I was more interested in Tiffy’s relationship with her ex-boyfriend and what was happening to Leon’s brother.
.
I don’t want to give too much away but I felt this was a good exploration of control and manipulation. Gaslighting has become such a hot topic, particularly in the #metoo movement, and this is the first novel I’ve read that really explores this in a relatable way.
.
As for Leon’s brother, I actually write about what happened to him for a living so I was very intrigued by this and let’s just say the state our legal system in is shocking and I highly recommend people read The Secret Barrister to find out more.
.
@betholearyauthor's talent as a writer is to absorb what’s going on in society around her, and write about it in such an easy to digest and sensitive way. And I think that’s why the Flatshare is so special.

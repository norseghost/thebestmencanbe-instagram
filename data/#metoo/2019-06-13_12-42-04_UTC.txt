Flashback of my Journey | 8 months of 
Memories that warm me up from the inside everytime I go through my footage and I'm reminded of a poem that my friend @sughoshark wrote for me 🏍️🏍️
I never knew I would reach here
Beyond the Boundaries
I feel like the river.
Never stopped, always flowing
Never heard about slowing, 
And my heart leads the way
And I follow without knowing.

And I keep asking myself
Is all this really true?
The world is still real,
Or is it just a fantasy?
But I keep moving on,
On the quest for my Sea,
Swim with me, 
and I'll take you there
What only my eyes can see! ❤️ #storiesfromtheroad while on the#DominarAustralasianOdyssey

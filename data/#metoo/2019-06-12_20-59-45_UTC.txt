Here are a few basic steps to help you on the healing journey from sexual abuse:  Step 1)  is to admit that you were abused. When you admit that the abuse happened, you open the door for healing to come your way. A light has been shined on a dark situation. Step 2) Is to grieve. You have experienced loss and you need to restore what was taken from you. Step 3) Is confronting your perpetrator. Some people choose to confront him/her face to face, but most people choose to write a letter, which does not have to be sent. Step 4 and 5) Is appropriately placing blame on the perpetrator and then having the courage to forgive. This is the hardest step.

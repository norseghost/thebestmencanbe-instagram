We are having a really hard time covering this topic because we never want it to sound as if we are bashing or blaming a parent in any way for their child’s abuse or death.
We are seeing so many headlines about children being sexually abused and killed by “the mother’s boyfriend” and our hearts break for the children and their moms (families). At the end of the day, please understand that these monsters prey on the vulnerable and they only need a small window of access and opportunity. We could quote a bunch of statistics, but the bottom line is we just can’t be too careful when it comes to who we allow around our children, especially unsupervised. That’s all......😢 #childsexabuseawareness #stopchildsexabuse #childsexabusesurvivor #parentsofchilldsexabusesurvivor #sexualassault #endchildsexabuse #endrapeculture #childabuse #sextrafficking #atlanta #ATL #Georgia #church #girls #teens #awareness #rapevictim #victim #children #prevention #trafficking  #survivor #tips #blogger #speaker #metoo #advocate #volunteer  #socialmedia

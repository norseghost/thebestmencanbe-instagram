Because it is Pride Month, we want to take some time to share a little information about abuse in the LGBTQ community that many may not know about. Many do not take abuse seriously within that community because of whatever reason they choice but it happens more than we realize. When it does, it is unlikely that they report it or seek protection orders because it often isn't taken seriously by law enforcement. It is so important that this receives the same level of urgency as anyone else suffering abuse at the hands of someone they love.

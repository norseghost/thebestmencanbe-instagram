#Advocate #Idaho ————————————————————————
In a crisis, it may be difficult to look for assistance, make decisions, and take care of yourself and others. A Family Crisis Center advocate can help in many ways. She or he can identify resources in the community that may otherwise may be unseen. An advocate can start contact with a service provider and facilitate the process. She or he can also give support and encouragement.

In this post you will find additional guidelines to finding support. Share to help others know our advocates are here to help! —————————————————————— #lifestyle #family #loveShouldntHurt #endDV #byui #DVfacts #entrepreneur #fall #design #wellness #marketing #friends #Idaho #TimesUp #meToo #Idaho #health #breakTheSilence #Idaho #graphicDesign #healthy #May ‬

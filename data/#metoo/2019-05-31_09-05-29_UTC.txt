Please don't forget that fast fashion is the second most polluting industry. 🚯
Companies that sell pride merchandise don't actually contribute to erasing homo/bi/trans/acephobia in the world. ☮
A part from that, PRIDE MONTH IS HEREEEEEEE 🎉🎊🎉🎊
which pride parade will you be going to? 
I will be at the Europride in Vienna if you wanna meet❤ ~🍦

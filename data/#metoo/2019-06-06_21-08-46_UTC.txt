Who said a beach had to have sand and waves? ‚†Ä
It's all in the eye of the beholder and when I look at this photo from my run in üá≤üá∞ Skopje - North Macedonia and see how many locals joined me, I know it's not really the beach running that is important. It's the joining together through sport to raise awareness to peacefully end sexual violence. A very BIG heartfelt thank you to all of you who ran, walked and biked with me last Saturday in country 47 ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚†Ä

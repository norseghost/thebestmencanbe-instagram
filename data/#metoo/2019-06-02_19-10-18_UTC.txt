I’ve worked so hard to get myself back on track again. These past 7years have been one hell of a coaster. At one point in time you wouldn’t see my smiling, talking... I am growing and moving forward. My life doesn’t stop. I can’t wait for this season with my team H.A.R.D❤️ #metoo #endsexualassault #livewildflowerchild

Dear Dianna,

I got this idea from reading @msrachelhollis book, #girlstopapologizing. After I read it back to myself, I cried. Not the ugly cry I did on Sunday (sweet baby Jesus! 🙌🏽), but more like the, “woman, you’re amazing,” kind of cry.
...
Perhaps I could’ve kept this to myself, but I challenge anyone who is holding themselves back from accomplishing their dreams to do this. It was freeing to remind myself of all the things I HAVE accomplished, versus constantly listing all the things I have not done (yet).
...
Go on, grab a piece of paper and a pencil, I’ll wait. 📝

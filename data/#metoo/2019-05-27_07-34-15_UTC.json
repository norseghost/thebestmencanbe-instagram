                        "text": "In some native law and custom of Igbo, a wife cannot inherit her husband\u2019s properties since she is like a chattel to be inherited by a relative of her husband. In other words, in most cases, the widow\u2019s brother in-laws go further to assume their late brother\u2019s personal relationship with his wife and when she says no, her problem becomes complex. \n__\nEweluka (2002) also noted that the customary law permits and perpetrates discrimination on the basis of gender especially in family relations. Women experience and suffer marital frustrations and depression and these continue even at the demise of the husband where a woman will have to face series of dehumanising treatments from in-laws with the claim that she killed her husband. Olakitike (2009) expressed that these widowhood practices violate a woman\u2019s rights.\n__\nNwosu (2007) opined that the disorganising and traumatic experience which accompanies death of husbands tends to be greater on women than that of men, while the wife immediately becomes the primary suspect for her husband\u2019s death, the husband is immediately offered an appropriate substitution to comfort him upon the loss of his wife.\n__\nAccording to Nwanegbo (1996), in some places, the wife is taken to an isolated place where she will have her food in broken earthen pot, while her hair will be left unkempt or be completely shaved off; while in some other places, ten men will have to lie with the widow after her husband\u2019s death and she has to cry very early each morning and call her husband by his name, this she will do for a month. \n__\nExcerpts from Paper by Dr Akinbi, Joseph Olukayode, Department Of History and International Studies Adekunle Ajasin University, Ondo State.\n__\n@harvard @youversion @realdonaldtrump \n@bbc @acalltomen @terrycrews @unitednations @cnn @islambook \n__\n#abuse #victim #rape #healing #fighter #lifeafterabuse #lifeafterabusefoundation #laaf #quote #metoo #men #boys #mcev #mencanendviolence #advocacy #manbox #globalgoals #nysc"

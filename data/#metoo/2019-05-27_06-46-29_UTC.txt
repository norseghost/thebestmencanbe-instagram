Although India has achieved gender parity at the primary education level and is on track to achieve parity at all education levels, as of January 2018, the proportion of seats in the Lok Sabha held by women had only reached 5.1% and 9.8% in the Rajya Sabha. 
India is also confronting the challenge of violence against women. As an example, a baseline study revealed that in New Delhi, 92% of women had experienced some form of sexual violence in public spaces during their lifetime. In 2016, close to a third of total crimes reported against women in India was cruelty or physical violence by her husband or his relative. The Government of India has identified ending violence against women as a key national priority, which resonates with the Sustainable Development targets of the United Nations on gender equality. 
The prime minister’s Beti Bachao Beti Padhao initiative aims at equal opportunity and education for girls in India. 
In addition, specific interventions on female employment, programmes on the empowerment of adolescent girls, the Sukanya Samridhi Yojana on girl child prosperity and the Janani Suraksha Yojana for mothers advance India’s commitment to gender equality, and the targets of Goal 4.

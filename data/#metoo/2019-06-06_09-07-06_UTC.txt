i can't say the word- what i can tell you with thorough certainty is about the aftermath- the spiritual armageddon that is all too familiar to me was instantaneous yet heinously obvious, my Self escaping through my pores little by little with each recurrence until there was nothing left. i am undead, the light such a contrast to what's inside me- or what isnt- that it's better off completely avoided and my blood runs cold- even my reflection is other-worldly for though it is present, it is empty. i may as well be made of wax for all my burdensome fragility, unable to keep composed even in the most benign of inconveniences.
they say to feel rage- to feel angry, and direct it outward, not in.
i feel nothing.

Our July release title is available for preorder! 💙🐰 a riveting and evocative collection about what it means to be a woman in today’s culture, told through personal reflections and vignettes by Marion Deutsche Cohen. *
Swipe for a sample poem “Seduction Culture 1960”.
*
The author has never been raped or assaulted (in any obvious way), but she still says #metoo because she has experienced, in the words of Larry Robin of Moonstone Arts in Philadelphia, "unwanted sexual activity". We live in a rape culture, assault culture, harassment culture, oversexed culture, which ties in with many other not-great things about our culture, such as guilt-tripping, ego-crap, and probably capitalism. With images from childhood, dreams, as well as adulthood and reality, both hers and that of others, the author chronicles that part of her life which causes her to, eagerly, echo "#metoo".

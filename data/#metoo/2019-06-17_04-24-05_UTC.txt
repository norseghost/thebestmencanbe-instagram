Truth
#TWFT52 @TheWordForThis .

I know truth is supposed to always stay the same, but I think my truth has changed since I've escaped my abuser. When I was with him, he dictated what the truth was. He removed any choices I had and told me what I was allowed to do. .
.

Maybe the truth was just buried, hidden, and waiting for me to break free. I think I like that idea. I think that's what makes the most sense. I lived smothered and unable to even think beyond what I was forced to do. Now I can breathe free air. It not only smells different, it feels different, and I still don't know what to do with it all. But I do know that the truth can no longer be hidden from me again..

I think truth is just truth, it stands alone, unchallenged, unchanging. It can't be taken away or changed, it can only be covered up or hidden. So here's to finding the truth without anyone else holding me back. Here's to freedom.

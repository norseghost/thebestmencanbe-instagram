But as the two terrified young men hid in a room on an upper floor from the chaos outside, they heard screaming and crept out to peer down the stairwell to see what was going on.\n\"We saw six soldiers that were raping two girls,\" he told the BBC.\nKhalid and his friend tried to intervene, shouting \"go away, go away\" at the armed men, part of the Rapid Support Force (RSF), more popularly known as the Janjaweed, who responded by shooting towards them.\u201c\n."

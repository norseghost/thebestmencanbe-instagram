We spent the morning at the 4th annual Consent Event in support of the Saffron Center. We only made it about 2k out of 5 because we were diverted by the playground but we had a great time raising awareness about #consent Thank you everyone who donated to help me reach my $500 fundraising goal! #consentevent #consentiscool #mentalhealth #distractedlydomestic #survivor #metoo #ibelieveyou #saffroncenter

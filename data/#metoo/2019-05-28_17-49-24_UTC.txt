Today, I did one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life - I confronted my rapist in court.

This past November, I was raped, and strangled - By someone I trusted, a close friend's brother and law enforcement officer. And for 6 months, my story and truth have been hijacked. But today, I set the record straight.

I share such a horrific, personal incident because during this time, I have disclosed to many women who have shared with me "me too." And my heart breaks for them. I cry for them. I am angry for them. And I feel guilty. Because I am one of the lucky ones. I am the 1% of rape survivors who sees prosecution, a felony conviction and jail time for my attacker.

This post is for the survivors who might not have ever told a soul. But know this -  When you feel all kinds of emotions from the horrible atrocities you underwent by the cowardly acts of another, please remember this: You are loved, this was not your fault, and there are many people like me who believe you.

I encourage you to talk to someone and utilize the many free resources available, if you feel so compelled:

Thank you to @women_deliver for having me as a panelist on the topic of what corporations are doing after the #metoo movement and how we are working to prevent workplace sexual harassment. Thank you to the other amazing panelists and thank you to @moki_canguro_cox and @pamjeffords for signing me up for this panel in the first place and supporting me when I doubted myself. Y'all are the best cheerleaders I could ask for. #wd2019

I don’t feel all of these things at once. I fear all of these things happening . I worry and hide my secrets to hide the trauma and damage from my abuser. It’s not easy to move on. It takes time and patience and more time and meeting a lot of the wrong people. #prsd #anxiety #mentalhealth #mentalillness #depression #domesticabuse #domesticviolence #metoo #rapesurvivor #reclaimhope

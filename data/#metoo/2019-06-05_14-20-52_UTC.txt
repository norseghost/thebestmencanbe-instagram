I have some exciting news to share with you all! I recently had the privilege of recording with @theprofessionalhomegirl for the @thephgpodcast where I discussed my experience being raped in college and my journey to becoming a rape crisis counselor. In the podcast I share more details of my personal experience, tips for survivors and my own thoughts on rape culture and victim blaming and why they continue. 
The lovely EbonÃ© started her podcast with the goal of sharing stories from women from all over the world that were comfortable enough to shed light on the lessons they learned during their growing pains! All guests are anonymous so PLEASE reach out to her if you are interested in telling her your story and follow her podcast because it is inspiring and thoughtful. ðŸ”Š Listen to the most recent episode of the podcast: Episode 21: I Was Raped https://anchor.fm/thephgpodcast/episodes/Episode-21-I-Was-Raped-e47prc

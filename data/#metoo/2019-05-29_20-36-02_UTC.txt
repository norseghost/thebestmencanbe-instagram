Painful sex can occur for many reasons. In some cases the pain is located in the pelvic area, and other times the pain you experience is everywhere, all the time. 
If your pain impacts your sex life and your desire to have sex, speak to a professional about this. your doctor may be able to do a pelvic exam to understand if/why sex is painful. A pelvic floor therapist can assist both mentally and physically to strengthen the pelvic area. 
Always remember that sex is supposed to be pleasurable. If it becomes undesirable, under no circumstances do you have to have sex. Period.

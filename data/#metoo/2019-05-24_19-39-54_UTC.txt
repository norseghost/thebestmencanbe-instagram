So many men have been sexually assulted & abused but not many step up & talk about it. Why? Could it be that we aren't given the same support? I find it sad that when it comes to sexual abuse only the women are taken serious & provide love & support! It's mind boggling because us men that's been abused desire justice as well! #metoo should not be just about the women, but the men need the support as well. It effects us just as much. It leads to downward spirals, addiction, mental & emotional issues & suicide. 
Here some men that have been abused & are speaking out. It's time that our voices be heard as well & it's time that we make it heard! Shout out to these fellows for being so brave & not silencing their voices along with myself...@razb_b2k @chester_be76 @terrycrews @cdogg22 @corey_haim_imagines @coreyhaim @common #michaelgaston @keyondooling

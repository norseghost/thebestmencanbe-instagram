Well that was ace. As one audience member said we were ‘bowled over’ by the opportunity to hear from Director Lezli-An Barrett and surprise attendee Audrey White, whose real life struggle against unfair dismissal was a key influence of the story in the film. A very engaging debate made today’s screening a really special, educational and memorable experience. Thanks to everyone who came and contributed to the Q&A. 📽👏🎬

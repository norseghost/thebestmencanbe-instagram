mental health is SO important. everyone knows it - everyone sees self care everywhere. but whether we do it or not... depends. cut off your negative thoughts when they start appearing. surround yourself with positive people. unfollow negative accounts. being selfish is okay. we all need to be a bit selfish sometimes.

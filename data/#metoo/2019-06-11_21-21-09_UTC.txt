Isn’t this what it’s about? One year on and we’ve held 10 courses and so many other exciting workshops and even sold out our first weekender in only a few hours. This space is about living, breathing and enjoying as you should in all aspects of your life.. not just dance. Don’t wait to walk into a studio to let go. Let go every day more and more and be ok with wherever you’re at and all you have NOW!!!! I’m so proud of each and every person who just trusts themselves to do something WILD 😍😈 shout out to @_sssnia on 🎥 capturing the vibe ❤️

Been a minute but I gotta make sure I let everyone know my daughter a senior at Wilson High School in Tacoma Wa is ranked in the top 10 in the nation in the long jump. This week site she goes to state to compete in the Triple jump, Long jump, and 4x100 relay. She also looks to break records with her performance. I'm a proud dad for sure! #usatf #trackandfield #sports #girlsrule #power #women #metoo #yoga #yogaposes #strength #sandiegostateuniversity #universityofflorida #lsu #longjump #fitness #fitlife #tacoma #spain #italy #

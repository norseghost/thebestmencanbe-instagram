🥂🥂🥂🥂What’s Good - My 1/2BDAY🥂🥂🥂🥂 One of My Best Experiences With Food 🍽

Barton G. Weiss exists in a league of his own. When you consider his accomplishments as an event concept designer, restaurateur, culinary visionary, author, and entertainer, finding true modern-day contemporaries to include in the same conversation is near impossible. Clients and guests are never sure what to expect because Barton has no real competition. His infinite ability to shock and awe is more consistent with the iconic creators and legendary innovators who consistently redefined what was possible beyond all stretches of the imagination.

Barton has led an unparalleled operational, culinary, and event production team based in Miami since 1993. During these 24 years, he has created some of the most groundbreaking, imaginative, and decadent gastronomic and event experiences the world has ever seen. His client list is a who’s who of Fortune 500 companies, international corporations, high-profile professional sports teams, and countless celebrity and social clients.

Inspired by the overwhelming consumer feedback from his events and catering businesses, Barton opened his first restaurant in 2002: Barton G. The Restaurant, in South Beach, Miami. In 2009, he premiered Prelude by Barton G. located inside the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, in Miami—pioneering the first-of-its-kind seamless theatrical/dining experience. In 2010, he took over operations of a Miami Beach boutique property to open a widely successful hotel and restaurant destination. In July 2014, Barton then opened Barton G. The Restaurant in Los Angeles. Visit them at https://www.bartong.com/about_us.html

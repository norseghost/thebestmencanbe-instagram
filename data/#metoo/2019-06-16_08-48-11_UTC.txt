ðŸ’‹Happy Fatherâ€™s Day to all the mums playing both Mum and Dad!

In the U.K. it is estimated that 1 in 4 children live with a single parent, and around 85% of those single parents are women.

Thatâ€™s around 1 million women. Just in the U.K. alone.

Parenting is a huge responsibility, but itâ€™s even tougher as a single mum. Thereâ€™s no partner to help with feeds, cleaning, changing nappies, school runs, paying for after school club, bed wetting, cooking... So today Iâ€™m choosing a to give one HUGE HIGH FIVE to those 1 million women in the U.K. and the other millions worldwide ðŸ™Œ This day is yours too. You rock.

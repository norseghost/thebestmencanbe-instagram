Today I officially uploaded my 80th post on the website. For those who may not know, I have been posting daily since March 18th and will be until June 26th, for a total of 100 days of posting. It feels so weird to say that I am nearly done a hundred days, as it feels like yesterday that I stopped volunteering at the radio station and decided to make the website. Though it has definitely been an exciting change so far, and hopefully it stays that way as more changes come! 
If you want to check out any of those 80 posts, you can at the link in my bio!

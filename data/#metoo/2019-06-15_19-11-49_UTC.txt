The face of an angry feminist. // 2 years ago when I was modeling abroad my cousin in London encouraged me to “do whatever gets your blood boiling.” I don’t think anything has had an effect such as that as much as fighting for women’s rights does. Going back to school and educating myself on women’s side of U.S. history - makes me walk out of college every day with a fist of grit and eyes of fire. Fighting for equality isn’t always about the big things - but the smallest every day matters. When a man says something sexist - speak up. When your friend/boyfriend/coworker is sexist - speak up. - speaking up - every day is what a feminist is. I do this in my own way by challengingly the beliefs of my significant other. Yes while he is respectful and equal - I feel almost every man could use a “daily equality check.” Challenge your own beliefs and challenge those around you.

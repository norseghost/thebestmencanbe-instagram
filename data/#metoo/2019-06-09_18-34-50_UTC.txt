Just this week I got to plant the seed of this truth with my son: that sometimes things working or not working between people ain’t about much you love someone. 
That instead it is about their ability to allow you to love them, to let the love in to nourish and change them from the inside out.

If they aren’t able to let that love in - it is not your fault nor responsibility to force that love on them.  That is their choice. Not yours.

You get to make the choice to let go (sometimes the most loving thang to do) or to hold on. 
If you chose to hold on - it is best to look at your intentions for why.  Are you enabling them/being co-dependent by holding on?  What do you get out of holding on?  How does it serve you and your growth as a soul?  Can you stay in relationship with them and truly, honestly give them complete freedom@of choice, with no expectations of them changing their ways - while getting your own needs met in this relationship?

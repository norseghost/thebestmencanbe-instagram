#SIFA2019 presents Checkpoint Theatre's 'Displaced Persons Welcome Dinner'. Written by Huzir Sulaiman, the piece explores the conundrums facing top-echelon humantarian workers in the alienating bureaucracy of a humanitarian NGO. Didn't quite expect the stronger angle of sexual violence and #metoo realities that eventually built up by the second half, though the play did explore themes surrounding mental health issues, of moral ambiguities. It very briefly skimmed upon the questions of neo-colonialism and cultural imperialism - thankfully, neither Gwyneth Paltrow or the "welcome dinner" ever materializes, as the fictional NGO strays onto a path of global scandal.

It is commendable that Huzir attempts to cover much ground over sexual harassment and the inherently fascist qualities of corporate bureaucratic culture. Other questions of impersonal mental health services and socio-economic privilege appear much more scattered. Intersectional theory would tell us that all these issues are interlinked at a fundamental, structural level. Hence 'Displaced Persons' could perhaps weigh out all its themes on a more interconnected plotline, perhaps a little more on the problematic aspects of the volunteerist economy.

After all, an NGO is using modern structures arising from capital to cure modern problems arising from capital - you can't heal the world by using the same tools that are killing it.

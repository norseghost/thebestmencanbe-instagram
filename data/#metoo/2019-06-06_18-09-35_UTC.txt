Some people have asked me why I think Andrea didn’t report Josh’s abusive behavior right away in the book. I think this powerful image from @rights.for.all sums it up. We assume it would be easy for a survivor to speak up but it’s not even close to being black-and-white. Especially when the abuser is someone we know, it adds an additional complex layer of shame, confusion, and fear.

A post that I don’t have many words for, just memories. Today I sobbed for an hour over anticipating food, and then my trauma therapist happened to call and we spoke for 40mins. As I’m here in hospital it doesn’t.go past my mind, body, or emotions that a year ago I was raped for the last time. It wasn’t my first sexual assault but I pray to God it will be my last. I tried to protect myself from it as a child until adulthood and neither deemed effective. Not a post for anything other than remembering, and knowing that I’ve become a hell of a lot stronger of a person since..

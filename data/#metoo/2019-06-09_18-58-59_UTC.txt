My Sunday thought: It can be so difficult to go to church when you are in immense amounts of pain. In other Christian churches I’ve been to, people come acknowledging they are broken. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, culturally, we tend to come showing off our “wholeness” which comes, of course, as a direct result of how well we keep the commandments. It hurts! It hurts to be at church surrounded by people who act whole when you are so crushed, you don’t have the energy to fake it, even if you wanted to. Right now, I’m focusing on going to the first 30 minutes of sacrament meeting. It doesn’t always feel great but I feel like I’m showing God that I’m doing what I can. If you don’t feel like you can go to church, I think there are one million great ways to show God you are “doing what you can.” I used to think there was only one way to show God you are His willing and obedient servant. Now, I think He just wants us to feel His love in whatever way we are able to feel it.

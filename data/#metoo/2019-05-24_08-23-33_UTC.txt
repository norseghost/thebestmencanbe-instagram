💃🏻 It has happened to many, me included, that going ot dancing became a #metoo moment. This is not something isolated to women, even tho it is highly skewed that way.

Somehow, people assume that because we are dancing together it gives you authorization to do whatever the heck you want. People hardly ask if you want to dance, and once dancing, people believe they can do whatever they want.

As a follower, we are taught how to partner in a way that we can indicate space. Needless to say, it is often disrigarded. Some followers do the same, and cross boundaries to force themselves into the leaders, which is as uncomfortable. 
I expect respect inside and outside the dancefloor. Consent is not a formality, is a right. #Relatable? Then, this post is for you. (If it is not, you want to read it even faster). 💃🏻👇 https://www.oddballroomdancer.com/2019/05/22/personal-space-and-consent-a-necessary-talk-in-ballroom-dancing/

When a young man at a party on Long Island folded his elbow around my throat, I didn't believe it at first. I had known him for four years, and sometimes he got carried away. Surely, this was a joke. 
But it wasn't. When he started dragging me off the lawn and into the shadows away from the crowd, something in me snapped. The previous assault had been only weeks earlier, and now it was happening all over again. 
All my life, I had done everything in my power to avoid hurting people no matter what they did to me. For 31 years, I had believed that violence couldn’t be defeated with violence. I had bought Jonathan gelato. I had paid hundreds of dollars to fly out to see the father who had sexually assaulted me. I had apologized to Top for the times that I had hurt him, never mind his assaults. 
But all my nonviolent philosophy had earned me was more violence from men. 
I stopped dissociating. This shit was really happening. Again. And no amount of thinking the best of someone was going to help me. Even as Nathan was dragging me off somewhere that other people couldn’t see us, I didn't want to hurt him. Yet I couldn’t breathe, and my lungs were starting to burn. My vision was going dark. This time, I would have to take care of this myself.

This time, I fought back.

I’m so #grateful & #blessed to meet amazing souls who are responding to the call to make a difference in our community. I know I’m on a mission. The truth to see others step up and say “I’m in it with you!” Says a whole lot! 
Thus 2018 has been rocky. Thus why I say, LETS make a CHANGE 🙏🏻
Thank you to the #carclubs, @purerenegade, @alabamavalentine , @lexicofashion & so many more who are allowing my voice to be heard to bring peace to #violence & recovery to trauma of #domesticviolence with @helpinghands_dv 🔥💋❤️

Thank you Ursula Burton and DP Cheli Clayton for interviewing me for Yale’s 50th Anniversary’s oral history project today.  Was thrilled to to also discuss my novel, “Sex and the Cyborg Goddess” (winner of the 2018 Irwin Award for “Best #MeToo Novel of the Year”), which is set in the first years of co-education at Yale, during the sexual liberation movement, anti-Vietnam War protests, and a campus labor strike. #yalewomen #novel #yale #coeducation #sexualfreedom #metoo

Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld. Ugh
Nepotism. Minimizing women's #metoo movement. Disgustingly blind ambition at the expense of others.

What good is a Harvard or Yale education and an amazing job if you have no soul and no morals? And if you have a mother, Amy Chua, that is hungry for fame and will do whatever shady $hit she has to in order to propagate her own name. Gross.

Underneath all the striving of both Amy and Sophia there must be terrible insecurity.

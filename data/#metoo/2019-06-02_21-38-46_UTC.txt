I've seen this post around the interwebs. I have to say I love it, because it promotes action. ⠀⠀

Every time I've seen it, I do it. And now it's your turn.⠀⠀

On this #selfcaresunday, it is so important to drop down into your body and be aware of what's going on. We can spend so much of our lives in our heads, not really aware of how we're experiencing life. ⠀⠀

What practice do you do be aware of your body? Prayer, yoga, breathwork, stretching. Let us know in the comments. ⠀⠀

This quote from Ben Carson is so important: "Health care is one-sixth of our economy. If the government can control that, they can control just about everything. We need to understand what is going on, because there are much more economic models that can be used to give us good health care than what we have now."⠀

It’s time for Americans to WAKE-UP to what’s going on in our healthcare system. Can I get an amen?!

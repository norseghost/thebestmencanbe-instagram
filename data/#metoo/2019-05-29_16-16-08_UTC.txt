2019 has been an exciting time for women in government🇿🇦 This #WomenOnFireWednesday we’re talking about women in leadership, and the ANC Women’s League’s call for gender equality in government leadership positions. “We believe women are ready, able and capable to lead. We are recharged to fight for more women to be appointed,” said Meokgo Maruba, the ANCWL secretary general. Mpumalanga’s premier Refilwe Mtsweni announced recently that her cabinet will have a 50/50 gender split. Not only is this an encouraging victory for gender equality, but also for women’s rights in South Africa. Well done to Maruba and Mtsweni, and all the other #WomenOnFire now taking on important leadership roles in government!

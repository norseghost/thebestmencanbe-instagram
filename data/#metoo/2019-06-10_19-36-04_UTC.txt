Today marks the beginning of National Men's Health Week ðŸŒ¤ & in celebration we are dedicating this week to our male followers. Although we prefer not to pigeon-hole people on an individual level including gender, sometimes it's important to talk about our differences in order to both explore & celebrate them together as human beings. Like women, men too are constantly under the pressure of societal 'norms' & stereotypes, although this phenomena tends to get far less airtime, particularly in the post #metoo era. The current zeitgeist feels like a time in which the world is starting to find its balance in terms of establishing more fluid gender roles, as well as opening dialogue about the mutual respect & understanding that we all deserve. In Sophrology I can definitely notice a change, where more men are asking for support & thatâ€™s wonderful news. Men are definitely feeling as much under pressure as women do, even if the type & causes of the pressures they describe are often different. As human beings, we all aspire to be loved, to be heard. Being the mother of a little boy, I see it every day at the playground: when a boy cries after he falls, he is often told that everything is OK. Culturally, boys are often told that they need to be strong & tough. In other words, from an early age, we are teaching our boys to be strong in a way that doesnâ€™t include connection to themselves & how they feel. Not being heard, not being given the freedom to feel from an early age can have a massive impact on the way men contribute to the world. It is so important that all men & boys have the support they need to live healthier, longer & more fulfilling lives. It can be tough for men to ask for help but if you donâ€™t ask when you need it things don't get better. So please do ask. We're here to listen.

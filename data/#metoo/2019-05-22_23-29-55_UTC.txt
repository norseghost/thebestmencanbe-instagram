â€œMeet your fear, until your fear becomes your FUN ! @iamjoelbrown âœ¨
There were so many amazing experiences in the last year of traveling, all because I said YES to life. I said YES to traveling solo.  And I said YES to doing something beyond my comfort zone.
âœ¨
Sure, it was a bit scary, but now itâ€™s fun! Thanks brother Joel for the inspo.

Iâ€™ve learned that putting yourself into new situations can drive depressive thoughts out by replacing them with new discoveries and super cool experiences . You see, we donâ€™t remember those times where we played it small, but in the end, weâ€™ll be able to see how well we lived our life.
âœ¨
Tell me a new experience that forced you out of your comfort zone, and letâ€™s encourage our peeps! ðŸ’«

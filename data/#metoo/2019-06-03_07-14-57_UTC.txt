The first U.S. monument to survivors of sexual violence is now on display in Washington DC: "The Monument Quilt features a collection of over 3,000 stories of sexual assault and domestic violence written, painted and stitched into red fabric by survivors and allies. The quilt, created by the the Baltimore-based organization FORCE: Upsetting Rape Culture, was constructed over the past six years as organizers traveled to 49 states and 33 cities in the U.S. and Mexico, where parts of the quilt were displayed. ... 'D.C. has many monuments, but not one for survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence,' organizer Lorena Kourousias told HuffPost. 'By blanketing the national mall, we are asking for space for survivors to heal.' ... 'I want people to understand that we are in a crisis point,' Young said. 'I want people to feel the urgency and to self-reflect on the ways that they have participated or colluded with a culture of rape.' Kourousias said that she believes the Monument Quilt will be a 'transformative space' for survivors and viewers alike. 
Both Kourousias and Young agreed that they hope everyone takes away one very important message from the Monument Quilt. 'We want folks to understand that they’re not alone and they’re part of a community,” Young said. “As we say all the time: We hear you, we see you, we believe you and you are not alone. And that’s what we hope people experience when they see the quilt.'" Read more: https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/monument-quilt-sexual-violence-washington-dc_n_5cf12bc2e4b0e346ce7ccfef

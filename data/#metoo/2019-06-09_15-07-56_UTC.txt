My Kosovo 16km run started out a little different than usual! That's because I was joined by an awesome group of Prizren locals in wheelchairs who are affected with muscular dystrophy. It is not easy to live in Kosovo with a disability and I'm so honoured that they faced all of the challenges to run - walk by my side and support survivors of sexual violence, locally and around the world. People with disabilities are also often impacted by sexual violence and left unheard or unhelped. Yesterday, we took some steps and wheels towards change.‚†Ä
Thank you Prizren and Kosovo! ‚†Ä

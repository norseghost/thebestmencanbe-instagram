I look back and I realize I've been through so much. It doesn't seem possible to survive all of that. Yet here I am surviving in spite of it all. I've read quotes saying "you survived the trauma, you'll survive the healing. "  Healing is hard and often so overwhelming and painful. I have to be reminded that "you CAN do this!" It WILL be ok" and "You are not alone in this." .

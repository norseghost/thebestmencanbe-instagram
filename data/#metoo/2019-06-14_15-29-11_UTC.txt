Yesterday, our president was able to participate in @sgfpolice Chief’s Community Advisory Group, where she discussed MO traffic stop data, recent protests, and community goals with some of Springfield’s leaders. She also made suggestions to improve the reporting process for sexual assault survivors. We are proud to be in a position to encourage positive change in Springfield!

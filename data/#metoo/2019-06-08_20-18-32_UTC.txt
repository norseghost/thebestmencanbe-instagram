Face (22/52): @detwylder 
You know when you have an amazing idea 💡.But one thing (maybe time) or another (probably fear) stops u from seeing it through. Chase doesn’t really have that. Chase’s life at a glance is a bunch of those “this would be a really great idea” moments stitched together. Working on a dating app, investing in the crypto currency (early), flipping houses and eventually selling one to the producer for Post Malone (but not before throwing a 400+ person rager 🎉 ). Chase is one of the best explorers I know. Always asking “why not” and squeezing all the life out of this short time we have here. Next up he’s heading to Europe to finish a book 📚 he’s been working on and I’m more excited for this project of his than any others. From Vegas to San Diego to NY I’ve always respected his lack of fear and it’s always inspiring to catch up with the homie!

Place (22/52) Spotted Pig in West Village
Spotted pig has a spotted past. When we went, I only knew that it was a well known restaurant frequented by celebrities 👩‍🎤 but after a google search I quickly realized why we didn’t have to wait for a table. Back in 2017 Spotted Pig was accused of multiple sexual allegations and had one of the biggest #metoo scandals in the restaurant business...Yikes 😬. Hopefully they’ve made drastic changes in the last two years but for now I’ll speak to the food. We both got the infamous burger with Roquefort cheese. Again, plagued by lack of research I had no idea Roquefort was blue cheese and I HATE blue cheese :/ With that being said the burger itself was good and well cooked so if u actually like blue cheese this might be for you. Having said THAT I can’t say it was worth 28$ 💰. As far as the fries, I’ve never met a side so challenging to eat. The flavor was good but impossible to eat more than 3 fries without stabbing yourself. Thankful for the company because this wasn’t my favorite spot.

What we had to say:
Chase: “Is there a good way to eat these fries” *switches over to a fork*
👏👏👏

Jarel: “Blue cheese, fries that fight back and #metoo scandals....Worst first date spot ever”
👏👏👏

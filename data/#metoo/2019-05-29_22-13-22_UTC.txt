Word..... sometimes it takes minutes sometimes it takes years and evil just happens and if your drugged by someone like say Bill Cosby someone you trusted or a complete stranger there's really nothing you could have done to prevent that so be gentle on yourself and trust that God has a place for people that do evil #metoo

I understand that the #BelieveWomen term likely started because of a perception that women speaking out about abuse from men are not listened to, but applying a principle of believing female accusers simply because theyâ€™re female (which undoubtedly a large portion of people have started doing) inherently means disbelieving the male accused because he is male. The falsely-accused are victims too. Everyone deserves to be treated as innocent until proven guilty. That includes women who are accused of abuse too and even women who are accused of making false accusations. -

ðŸ¥€ I received an advanced reader copy of Aphrodite Made Me Do It by Trista Mateer earlier this week and read it in its entirety almost immediately. The quotes Iâ€™ve included in my field notes are some - but not all - of the incredible verses penned by this gifted poet. â€¢

ðŸ¥€ QUICK REVIEW: Trista Mateer paints a vivid picture of love, loss, and personal demons in her newest collection of poetry. Every word she has written and every striking visual she provides tells a story so profoundly modern yet as old as time itself. This is a book I will forever cherish and read over and over again as well as recommend it to every woman in my life. ðŸ¥€

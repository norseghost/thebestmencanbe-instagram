An excerpt of my interview - Mid East Art: What memories do you have of Marsam Al Hur in Kuwait (circa 1960s) ?

Abdul Qader: It was 1965 when I first shared my work in an exhibition with the artists in Marsam. In the same area, I participated in an arts program that combined arts and sports. They gave me so much art material like oil and brushes. In Marsam this was the first time I saw the art books of masters’ like  Michelangelo and Rubens. I would look at these books without reading because at that point I didn’t know how to read English. I was reading the colors and learning how to create composition. I focused on portraits and still life. Rembrandt was like my teacher; I was studying from his books until 1966. In 1967, I began to change to Impressionism, learning from Degas, Monet and Pissarro. I especially learned from Degas’ pastels, while the light and shadow I learned from Rembrandt.

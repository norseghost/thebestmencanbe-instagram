I can't believe it's been 4 weeks since GG left. Her life wasn't always easy, but she never stopped fighting for the rights of others and she never stopped caring for those who entered her life. She made me believe that I could do anything as long as I kept reaching for the stars. 
The weekend following her death I took my family up to her house in the northwoods of Wisconsin. My kids are city kids and when they found that GG had a bear (named Clarence) who frequented her bird feeders, they were not to keen to go outside. Especially in the pitch black of night. I don't blame them, I'm not fond of it either. Anyway, her house is in a clearing and the stars above are incredible. I wanted the boys to see what real stars look like, but they insisted I hold them. First out was my oldest. I picked him up to point out a dipper and seconds after looking up, a shooting star streaked past. After 30 seconds he was over the stars so I brought out my littlest. Same thing. Picked him up, pointed out a dipper and another shooting star! No one else in the family caught them. 
I know it was GG telling me and my kids to never stop reaching for the stars. 
Peace my sweet GG, because I know you aren't resting. Xoxo

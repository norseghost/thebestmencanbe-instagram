                        "text": "NEW BLOG | It\u2019s time for me to be brave. #metoo\n\nAs some of you may know, I\u2019ve been trying to write about sexism and harassment in archeology and academia since I started my blog. And well, I\u2019ve finally done it. \nFollow the link in my bio to read this new post where I share some of my experiences with sexism and harassment during my career as an academic archeologist, and what I hope is useful advice for dealing with such horrifically unpleasant situations. Because as a field and society - while we have certainly come a long way -  we still have to do better. For each other, and especially for our children. \nI firmly believe that we all need to speak out about the issues of sexism and harassment. We need to raise awareness and keep the dialog going. To help each other prevent these things from happening by de-normalizing them, and to help each other learn how to cope when they do happen. To be active allies. \nThis post is part of my attempt to do just that, and I hope you will all give it a read. Let me know what you think in the comments \ud83d\udd8b *Please note that while there are undoubtedly many forms of discrimination happening in many workplaces, including sexism towards men or people of color, in this blog I focus on my own experiences as a woman in archeology and academia. Be kind \ud83d\udc9b"

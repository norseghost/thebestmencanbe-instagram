If you aren’t comfortable in your own skin, then you will NEVER be comfortable. Trust me, I know. I look at myself everyday and find everything I hate, done it for years. Lately, I look at myself and say out loud, “I need to LOVE myself for what you have overcome, to show my babies, that no matter how hard and evil the world can be, NEVER LOSE WHO YOU ARE, NEVER LET ANYONE BRING YOU DOWN, and ALWAYS BE TRUE TOO YOU’RE HEART AND SOUL💜💙💚❤️🧡💛... Remember to always be YOU; no matter what struggles you have, never give up, stay positive; and share kindness and love........ I am learning this at a late age, and I wish My heart was stronger many years ago💛...... I am being me and loving every single fucking minute of it, no matter WHAT!!!!

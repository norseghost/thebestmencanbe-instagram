(Come see Spit Dat's own Drew "Droopy" Anderson co-starring in #foolsandmadmen #hiphopmuchado !) "This looks not like a nuptial..." But it DOES, Benedick! 
It looks like a marriage of Hip Hop and Shakespeare / 
From the same crew which last year brought you Hip Hop King Lear / 
It looks like a marriage of old with the new / 
Bard verse, bars served, and social themes still ringing true / 
Age-old misogyny unpacked anew post #MeToo / 
Slandered and slut-shamed at the altar; what's a Hero to do? / 
It looks like all of the above with a live band, too / 
It looks like #foolsandmadmen are back with #hiphopmuchado !

About fools and madmen:

fools and madmen brings hip hop adaptations of Shakespeare's plays to Baltimore City Schools for free. Our goals are to bring classical theatre to Baltimore City Schools, combat racial disparity in classical theatre, and to bridge the gap between Shakespeare and Hip Hop as artforms. We believe that Shakespeareâ€™s stories belong to everyone, and that everyone should have the opportunity to access them.

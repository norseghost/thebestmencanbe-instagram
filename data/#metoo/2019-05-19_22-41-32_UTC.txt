Okay, I saw John Wick 3 last night, so please STOP reading now if you havenâ€™t seen it yet!! #SpoilerAlert . .
*Disclaimer: the following is about John Wick and does not reflect the way I feel about Keanu, who is an amazing human and posed with us in Malibu when we were fangirling hard lmao* ðŸ¤£

I loved the first John Wick! The problem I have with both the 2nd and 3rd chapter is the same: so over-the-top unbelievable that itâ€™s just plain stupid. Now donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m all about fantasy entertainment (canâ€™t wait for GOT tonight), but if youâ€™re going to make a plot that is so ridiculously unfathomable then you better have some kickass writing, acting, and character chemistry (i.e. Faceoff, Benjamin Button)...
.

The first John Wick was such a great movie because most of it really COULDâ€™VE happened, and the main protagonist is humanized (he cries, he loves, he drinks water), so you connect with him and are rooting for him to get vengeance. In 2 & now 3, he just turns into some sort of weirdo robot and thereâ€™s no real connection with any other characters. The plot was all over the place (A dark Russian orphanage with ballet and wrestling? The weird monotone lady agent who is affiliated with the High Table? Who really is the dude in Morocco who lives in a tent? How did John survive 48 hours in the desert with no water and still wearing his tie and not a drop of sweat on his shirt? What happened to Halle Berryâ€™s character? How did Lawerence Fishburne survive 7 samari sword slashings? Why is he so eerily resembling his character on the Matrix?).
.

Sorry to go on and on about a silly olâ€™ movie, but I left the theatre unsatisfied, perplexed, and really irritated at the ending. John Wick, you were so cool on our first date...now Iâ€™m over you! ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.

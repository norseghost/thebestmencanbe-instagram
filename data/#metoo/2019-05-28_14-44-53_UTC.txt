He broke trust. He vowed to love family and God and yet he stuck his tongue down my throat and touched me inappropriately. God apparently left the building and I was not his only prey. He was God to so many but Satan to me.  A girl is not safe in this World hell boys aren't either. But I am healing taking back control from a secret that consumed my life and almost killed me. It is the reason I wrote Blue's Sanctuary. Link in my bio. To give myself a voice that that fucked stole.

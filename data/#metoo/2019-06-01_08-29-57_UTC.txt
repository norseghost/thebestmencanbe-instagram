We are raised to be conformists: to obey the rules, to not argue with authorities, to fit in. Rarely we are taught self-respect, ambition for improvement, courage to confront the rules. 
We live in a very interesting world: we praise free speech, creativity, yet bars get higher by a day. Almost as if we are not allowed to believe in what we feel is right, but have to accept what others think is good for us. Starting from the size of clothes and up to moral values.
If you see injustice - speak up. If you see rules and norms that humiliate humans - ridicule it. Violence against human dignity should not bring silence upon us. Speaking up, voicing your opinion that is not popular or uncomfortable is not something that should make you an outcast. If you see a child being abused - protect it. If an animal is getting hurt - protect it. If a human is being abused - protect it. You have a voice. And your voice matters. No matter what some people say. You matter.

I wrote this poem for the Dear June challenge @hannahwitton made. Today’s prompt is “Icons.” I used to get really upset when I found out certain celebrities and creative heroes of mine did terrible things. This was compounded with the amazing success of the #metoo movement. So I’ve found myself trying to distance myself from creators I admire but don’t personally know. I think we place to much our own personal value in Iconic Figures rather than ourselves and the people who are in our lives. It’s good to have heroes but you have to remember they’re human. .

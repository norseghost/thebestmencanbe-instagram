#FarahKhaleck was just 17 when she first started experiencing the symptoms of the autoimmune disease scleroderma

The first symptoms of scleroderma came when Farah noticed that her movement had become limited, and the disease quickly progressed over the next decade. Her illness kept her from getting a job in her native Nairobi, but her love of fashion and the internet provided her with an alternative.

At 29 years old, Farah’s hands and skin have been severely affected by scleroderma, but this hasn’t stopped her from becoming a lifestyle blogger.

Once embarrassed by her changing looks, Farah now embraces the new her and in doing so, inspires others around the world.

She uses her blog Glam by Farah to help build her own self-confidence and encourages others to bring out the best in themselves.

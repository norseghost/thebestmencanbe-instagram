It can be challenging for trauma survivors to tell their stories in a linear framework. Our amygdalas, or the emotional centers of our brains, are often in overdrive after so many years of stress, and limit the functioning of our pre-frontal cortex: the part of the brain responsible for reason and linear processing. I know I have a book in me, but I need a creative way to tell it that works with how my brain functions. So, I’m using strategies I learned with @ideo: DESIGN THINKING. Apart of this process is using post it notes to get out all of the ideas in your head and then you can organize them later! Here are my notes. My bedroom wall will be my vision board. I’ll keep you updated on how it’s going! What tools are you using to fulfill your dreams? .

This is Maryam Monsef, Canada's current Minister of Women and Gender Equality. .
.
.
Maryam was born November 7, 1984 in Mashhad, Iran, to Hazara Afghan parents who had fled during the Sovietâ€“Afghan War. Because Iran and Afghanistan (before 2000) followed the principle of jus sanguinis in their respective nationality laws, Monsef was born an Afghan citizen.

The family struggled in Iran because of low economic and social prospects for Afghan migrants even though they had legal status as "involuntary migrants" (mohajerin) under Iranian rules in effect prior to 1992.

In 1996 her mother opted to move the family to Canada, and the resulting journey involved traveling through Iran, Pakistan, and Jordan until their arrival in Peterborough, where Monsef's uncle already lived. Once in Canada they relied on the support of several charity organizations, including the YMCA and the Salvation Army.

This 34 year old woman who has been living in so called Canada for for 22 years is the person who is refusing to sign off on Bill S-3 to remove all sex discrimination from the Indian Act.

If you are not deeply troubled by this, you should be. .

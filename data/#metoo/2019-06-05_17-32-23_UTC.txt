Judith Slaying Holofernes, Circa 1610 Artist: Artemisia Gentileschi The dying man is Holofernes, an enemy of the Israelites in the Old Testament, and the young woman beheading him is Judith, his divinely appointed assassin. Yet at the same time he is also an Italian painter called Agostino Tassi, while the woman with the sword is Artemisia Gentileschi, who painted this. It is, effectively, a self-portrait #metoo #art #baroque #italy #badass #history #femaleartist #slay #feminist

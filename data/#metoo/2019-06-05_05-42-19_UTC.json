They are one and the same..#georgesorros financed that cult. The result are <#racewars #genderwar . #aboriginalsbehindenemyline \"\u2018Anytime you live in a society supposedly based upon law and it doesn\u2019t enforce its own laws because the color of a man\u2019s skin happens to be wrong, then I say those people are justified to resort to any means necessary to bring about justice when the government can\u2019t give them justice.\u2019'\n\u201cI read once, passingly, about an #aboriginal named #Shakespeare. I only read about him passingly, but I remember one thing he wrote that kind of moved me. He put it in the mouth of Hamlet, I think, it was, who said, \u2018To be or not to be.\u2019 He was in doubt about something\u2014whether it was nobler in the mind of man to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\u2014moderation\u2014or to take up arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them. And I go for that. If you take up arms, you\u2019ll end it, but if you sit around and wait for the one who\u2019s in power to make up his mind that he should end it, you\u2019ll be waiting a long time. And in my opinion, the young generation of whites, blacks, browns, whatever else there is, you\u2019re living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution, a time when there\u2019s got to be a change. People in power have misused it, and now there has to be a change and a better world has to be built, and the only way it\u2019s going to be built\u2014is with extreme methods. And I, for one, will join in with anyone\u2014I don\u2019t care what color you are\u2014as long as you want to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth.\u201d the liberals would like to replace the Male's energy with #captainmarvel, who used to be #msmarvel.  They want to rid themselves of all Male #LEADERSHIP . #aboriginalsbehindenemyline. They want us all to bow down and worship the mother goddess.  Check out the game y,all.  Those that eyes to see will see.."

Sound bites from the season coming through. @alldenslane talking about how our culture of deference can affect sexual abuse victims. It is important to create an environment of openness in the home at least. African parents can be very strict and tend to discipline the personalities out of their children. Being overly harsh can make children hesitant and in some cases mute. The #metoo conversation is different in Africa and Iâ€™m glad to be part of moving the conversation forward. #sexualabuse #sexualviolence #rapevictim #rapeculture

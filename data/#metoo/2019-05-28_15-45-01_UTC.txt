“Fallen Dream”, my upcoming film is so much more than a #metoo film. Can’t wait for you to see it, it’s got an unexpected twist!
During Cannes film festival I had an awakening. But not really. It was just a reminder of the reality when it comes to wealth, fame and power. Society needs to keep evolving and change for the better for all individuals. This film is about sisterhood, between women to women, women to men, and men to men about women. Women are your mother, your sister, your wife, your daughter. Treat any woman with the same respect as you’d want your family to be treated. *Picture with two extraordinary women doing good for female rights, awarded at the Better World Award this past weekend. @reneewillett @soniancole #womenempowerment

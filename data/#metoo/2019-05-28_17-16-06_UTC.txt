Fight Fearlessly is an outlet for those who suffer from trauma, rape or abuse — whether it be domestic, sexual, verbal, or emotional. As a survivor of rape myself, I know how alone you can feel. I’m launching this page to empower women to speak up, vent, or to even have their stories heard anonymously. We are a pact, and together, we are warriors. •

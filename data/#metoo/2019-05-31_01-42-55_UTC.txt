In an interview with David Letterman, Ellen DeGeneres opened up about being sexually assaulted by her step-father when she was a teenager. In the interview, Ellen emphasizes the difficulties that survivors face - especially at young ages - in standing up to their abusers, reporting an assault or even telling a family member. Time and time again survivors come forward and their stories are dismissed because they didn't report their assault at the time it occurred - perhaps due to the fact that they felt unsafe, did not have access to an outlet or resources that could assist them, or were experiencing severe post-traumatic stress that inhibited their ability to process and report their assault. Ellen shared her story in the hopes of encouraging other survivors to not suffer in silence, and to help establish an environment in which they will feel supported should they choose to come forward with their own stories. As we continue the conversation about sexual assault, we come closer to dismantling assault, abuse, and rape culture. Thank you, Ellen, for being apart of the conversation. The interview will be released in full this Friday. #EndRapeCulture #SexualAssaultAwareness #Consent #EllenDeGeneres #StandWithSurvivors #MeToo #TimesUp

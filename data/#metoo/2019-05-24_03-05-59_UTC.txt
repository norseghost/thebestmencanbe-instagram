Pigs are the 4th Most Intelligent AnimalüêΩ Pigs are believed to be one of most intelligent animals, following chimps, dolphins, and elephants. We might think our dogs are the smartest animals when the can roll over or shake on command, but they surpass even man‚Äôs best friend.

Their intelligence was first discovered in experiments in the 1990s. Pigs were taught several tasks using a cursor on a computer screen. They learned these tasks as quickly as chimps. They could move a cursor on a screen with their snouts, as well as use the cursor to distinguish between scribbles they knew and those they were seeing for the first time. Pigs are Very Social

Pigs have complex social lives. They learn from one another and work together. Just like dogs, they love to play and participate in play fighting. These pink farm animals even have been found to show compassion or empathy when observed in another animal. They can sense if a person will be nice to them. They‚Äôre also able to distinguish between familiar pigs and strangers. Overall, research has shown pigs are skilled at mazes and other tests requiring location of objects and they also have excellent long-term memories. They can even use a mirror to find hidden food.

We get tired and busy and the first thing that goes is our own self-care. 
I do it too. But, fasting has made me so much more aware of that process. 
It's taught me that once my self-care goes out the window, my body craves its replacement. 
My body needs love. 
My body deserves love. 
My body needs rest. 
My body had a voice.
And if I am ignoring it, it asks me for love in terms of food. 
It asks me for 3pm doughnuts and warm comforting mac and cheese. 
It asks me for love. 
When I ignore my body, it screams. .

So, what can we do? 
Because we are all really busy with all the commitments we agreed to do. 
We really are tired, and it's a kind of tired that a few naps can't fix. .

Give space for your body to be listened to. 
When you do stop to eat, remember to breathe. 
When traffic stops, you are at a light, in the lull of a conversation: take some deep breaths. .
.
Ask your body: what do you need?

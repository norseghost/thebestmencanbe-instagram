When we have lived according to lies about ourselves, we experience shame and hopelessness. We begin to believe that we can never escape the feelings of self-hatred, disgust and pain that have become a normal part of our lives. Even when we begin to realize, that those beliefs about ourselves are lies â€“ there is still so much pain connected to memories of the abuse we have experienced, that we may still feel hopeless. Many survivors of sexual abuse lose hope to the point of feeling suicidal, or of hurting themselves. The only way to start living free is to uncover the lies that you have believed about yourself, and replace those lies with truth. By doing this, you will begin to live with hope for the future once again.  #notjustahashtagpodcast

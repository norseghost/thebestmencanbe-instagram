Such a fun day working with  @skechers!! Can I just say, after 16 years of modeling and now a trainer and woman’s empowerment leader, it’s always nice to get right back into things!! Modeling has been my dream and passion since I was little. Coming from a small town in Canada taking me all over the world. Throughout it I learned about myself, others and the world. What a journey it has been and continues to be! Thank you @sophiaportermakeup @heatherlurk  for the gorgeous hair and makeup!! #grateful #fitnessjourney

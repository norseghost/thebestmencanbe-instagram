This has been a long term project for far to long. Writing for it is weird. Started years ago. In time hoping to make some type of installation. It's a community project. These have been brutal years, as well, I like to have this project as a constant to refocus at points in life, like current jams and whatnot. I roam around lost and horribly approaching people and ask one question. To draw a heart in whatever form they decide on a post it. And accept it however cute, or accurate or some borderline offensive to others or themselves they are. They were all drawn by humans. However, you can't determine age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, ableism, ECT. All drawn differently, some simpler than others, all identifiers left unseen. I hope to finish this project appropriately. I hope to start to feel better or just survive I don't really know through to better days I suppose. It's a culture project and a lot of the writing is to cover perspectives in a positive way. I can't write it all from just my perspective. The first couple rounds I hired people to help and didn't get to it ever, maybe in time.  Anyhow. I hope beyond hypercritical chaos and indescribable challenges were facing as a planet, there's at least potential somehow to... #freepress #metoo #blacklivesmatter #waterprotectors #universal #culture #diversity #earth

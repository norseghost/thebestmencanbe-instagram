                        "text": "#NoMeansNo and \"never again\" and \"never be quiet,\" but who hears us through patriarchal delusion everywhere?\n\nDo you? #MeToo!\n\nPeople who have been sexually abused don't usually fall prey to romantic delusions. No. Rather, we fall prey to the lies of our partner, to their punches, and to the collapsing state apparatus that supports #predators at our expense. Yes. Again and again #survivors are victimized when we must record our #trauma for people, companies, and governments who want to better monitor the problem. We are but fodder and victims of the larger social war in motion. #SeVaACaer.\n\nI say this as an activist and scholar in social movements for gender justice and as someone who recently departed a safe home for brave abused women. I spent 10 weeks there. My former husband worked or still works at Google. He used the internet and everyday professional situations to engage in rape by fraud and proxy. Since leaving our abusive partnership more than four years ago, I've been hacked too many times to count.\n\nAs for me and #NiUnaMenos, I\u2019m actively teaching people looking to #decolonize their business. I also help people design reparations funding campaigns. Speaking of financial reparations, here\u2019s my newest definition for it.\n\n#Reparations: a heartfelt financial apology that doesn\u2019t always feel good to colonizers, sexual predators, and the company they keep."

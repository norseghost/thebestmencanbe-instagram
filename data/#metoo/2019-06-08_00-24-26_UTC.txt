Working on my #memoir today at the @wachicago Brassiere. It’s the small things that help me push through the darkness of my life to finish this book. And that cookie was to dieeee for. Love this spot—Nice staff - great atmosphere *sips tea*. ☕️💋 #raewrites #unprotected #hivpositive ——————————————————————— #womenempowerment #author #womanism #authorsofinstagram #hivaidsawareness #womanist #womenshealth #metoo #timesup #intersectionalfeminism #traumasurvivor #traumarecovery #aids

"A Conversation with La Doña"

Taken in a village in Oaxaca July 3, 2008.  It was a beautiful sunny July afternoon in a quaint pueblo in Oaxaca, México.  I was visiting my honorary grandmother, Lupita Romero, the 97-year-old matriarch of the village. We sat in the outside dining room as I served tapioca and refreshments that I brought for our visit. A gentle woman approached us, slowly walking in and was greeted with enthusiasm. My grandmother proudly introduced this woman, Lupita Hernandez, as her best friend. They had known each other since they were young girls.  We invited her to sit with us.  After feeling comfortable, the visitor, who I respectfully referred to as “La Doña,” began to share stories of her life.  Her mother abandoned her when she was three months old and her aunt breast-fed her but died shortly after. She never knew any of her brothers or sisters. At the age of eight she was sold to an old man whom she was forced to marry.  After years of abuse, he finally died, freeing her from his clutches.  The children she was forced to bare with him now live in the city of Oaxaca but never visited her.  My grandmother quickly told me that her bestfriend has a lovely soul. La Doña smiled and glowed upon hearing the compliment.  She never came to visit empty-handed, frequently bringing fresh eggs from her chickens, atole, flowers or herbs if there was an ailment.  I looked at this amazing woman, so gentle and kind, and admired her strength and loving spirit.  I reflected on my own blessings and was grateful that our paths had crossed. It was a precious time together.

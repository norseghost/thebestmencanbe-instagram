HONEY I WROTE A PLAY!
Yes yours truly wrote a couple of scenes for the Misogyny Trials. And one got dropped last time around but I see it's been added to the new schedule for the 13th. It's called Women to Woman and it was inspired by a workshop Cheryl Garvey and I ran last year called Bringing a Woman Down (which was surprisingly well attended). Basically, we heard so many stories from women who said some of their worst experiences of being undermined came from other women, who had humiliated them in public.

So that’s what it's about. A group of women take one woman - a really powerful woman - to court for her misogyny.

Can you guess what her sentence is?

Happy Saturday and if you're a radio buff, we're on NewStyle today and tomorrow on BBCWM

At the MAC Birmingham ⬆️ Thursday 13th June.

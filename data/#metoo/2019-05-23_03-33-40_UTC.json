                        "text": "Nan-Hui Jo is a devoted single mom and immigrant Korean American who fought \"child abduction\" charges for fleeing an abusive relationship with her daughter. \nIn 2014, Nan-Hui was tried for child abduction and served time in jail after being convicted. Despite a history of domestic violence, Nan-Hui's ex partner was granted full custody of her daughter.\n\nImmigration officials and police failed to protect Nan-Hui from domestic violence and inform her she could apply for legal immigration status under the Violence Against Women Act. Because of her legal status, she was immediately detained by ICE after being released from jail.\n\nNan-Hui's legal battle inspired the #StandWithNanHui grassroots campaign to advocate for her freedom, protect her from deportation, and call for reunification with her daughter. In July 2015, Nan-Hui was released from ICE custody.\n\nIn 2016, organizers from this campaign went on to help found Survived & Punished, a national coalition to end the criminalization of domestic and sexual violence survivors. .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n[Image: A mint green graphic with a color photo of Nan-Hui Jo crouched down, wrapping her arms around her child. The child is holding a large bouquet of flowers. They're inside a building and in the background is a sign with some Korean words on it. The graphic says \"Nan-Hui Jo, Single Mother & Survivor of Domestic Violence\" and #APAHM]"

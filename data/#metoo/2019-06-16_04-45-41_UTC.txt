Disease is like a chair. It needs four legs to stand up. Those four core components are diet, stress, toxins, and genetics. ⠀
⠀
And wouldn’t you know it… STRESS is one of the biggest causes of disease. ⠀
⠀
Isn’t it interesting that the one thing on that list that is most under our control, is the biggest issue? Not genetics. Stress. ⠀
⠀
So why is it that when we make decisions, taking into account our stress levels and the amount of anxiety it will place on us is one of the last things we consider? ⠀
⠀
Now, I’m not telling you to never do anything that pushes you outside your comfort zone. But if you know something is going to be a stressor for you, take the time to make a plan. Think about what things you could do to plan ahead and minimize the stress, or avoid it altogether! ⠀

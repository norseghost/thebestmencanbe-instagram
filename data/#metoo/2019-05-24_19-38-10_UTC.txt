In the upcoming season of #DavidLetterman’s #Netflix show “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction,” the former late-night host interviews hip hop artist and businessman #KanyeWest. The Daily Beast posted a review of the interview, which details how West opened up about his fear as a man during the #MeToo movement and why he thinks liberals “bully” Trump supporters “like [him].”

The hour-long conversation consisted of many topics surrounding the often controversial artist, including his mother, his old beef with Drake, battling bipolar disorder and life as an influential being. But one of the most noteworthy moments of the interview was West defending his support of #DonaldTrump. “This is like my thing with Trump—we don’t have to feel the same way, but we have the right to feel what we feel.” When he wears his “Make America Great Again” hat, he says it’s “not about politics,” West explains. He went on to say his reason for wearing the “Make America Great Again” is not because of politics but instead to break down the stigma around supporting Trump. West also says he didn’t vote for Trump, nor has he ever voted. “Then you don’t have a say in this,” Letterman replied.

At one point, West ignores a point Letterman makes about it being problematic to support an individual who directly harms various groups of people with their words and actions. Instead of acknowledging, West says he cares about Trump voters who are “treated like enemies of America because that’s what they felt.” “Have you ever been beat up in your high school for wearing the wrong hat?” he asks eventually. When asked who is doing the majority of bullying in America right now, West says, “Liberals bully people who are Trump supporters!”.

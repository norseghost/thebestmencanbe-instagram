“There is a beautiful story, a fable, that goes like this: After eating a hen, the fox was arrested and brought to a judge. The fox denies the wrongdoing and the judge asks the fox if it has a witness to prove its innocence, to which the fox shows its tail to the judge saying: Here is my witness.😂🤔🤗”R.F.

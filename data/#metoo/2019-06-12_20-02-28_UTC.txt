Join me as I chat with Alice Wheaton, President of CoreGrowth Foundations Inc. 
Alice takes us along her journey that started in Northern Newfoundland. The experiences she gathered along the way led to her philosophy on what separates the high-performers from all the rest in your organization, and what keeps them around. From starting out as an emergency room nurse to becoming the first female salesperson for Xerox Canada, her story is inspiring, honest, heartfelt, and at times downright entertaining. 
As the author of six books that have been translated in over 16 languages, her take on personal reflection and growth will give you a fresh perspective on what just may be holding you back. 
Because choosing to face what lies ahead with either a positive or negative outlook, is entirely up to you

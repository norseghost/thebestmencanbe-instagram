Story of an Indian child : 
Twinkle's autopsy has revealed broken ribs, nose and legs, with her body also missing an arm. She was allegedly killed by men who owed her family Rs 10,000.
Twinkle was Shilpa and her husband Banwari Lal Sharma’s only daughter.
The couple last saw their daughter alive on 30 May, a Thursday, when she left the house around 8.30 am to play with her friends. Forty-eight hours later, her decomposed, maggot-infested body was dragged out of a garbage dump near her house by stray dogs, who then ravaged the body further.
Her eyes were popping out, right arm had been cut off, left leg, ribs, nose fractured, and the corpse nibbled by insects and rodents, in some parts down to her bone.
Failing to get that image out of her head, Shilpa rubbed her eyes vigorously and shook her head every five minutes. “The stench of her body is still fresh in my nose. That image of her lying in a garbage heap, in that condition, haunts me,” she said, “I do not think I can ever get it out of my head.”
According to Aligarh police, the child was abducted by two men, Zahid and Aslam, who then tortured and murdered her. The reason: The duo owed her grandfather Rs 10,000 and had had an argument with him just two days before. In the heat of the argument, they had warned him that they would teach him a lesson.
The two have been booked, among other sections, under the National Security Act, which is generally reserved for terror-related offence.
Plea for hang till death for killers ! 🙏🏻

Did you know that your thoughts can have a direct impact on your health? ⠀
⠀
From a scientific standpoint, every time we have a thought, our brain creates a groove, or pathway if you will, in our brain. ⠀
⠀
Every time we have the same reoccurring thought, the groove gets deeper and deeper into the brain, making it harder and harder to iron out if needed. ⠀
⠀
If you’ve lived your entire life thinking that you are a failure or a disappointment, you are going to live as though you are a failure and a disappointment!⠀
⠀
A study showed that it’s possible we could have up to 60,000 thoughts per day! It also showed that on average, 98% of those thoughts are reoccurring, meaning that you’ve had them every day for days on end! ⠀
⠀
That’s a scary statistic if you’re telling yourself something like, “I am addicted to sugar… I will never have self-control.” ⠀
⠀
Friend, you do NOT have to be a victim to your past. Take control of your thoughts, and take back your life!

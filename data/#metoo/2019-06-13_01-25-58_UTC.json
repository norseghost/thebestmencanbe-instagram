                        "text": "White Supremacy and sexual assault interact on a frequent level. For example, the police department not trying very hard to solve, and disbelieving, Jewish, Black, and other minority victims about being assaulted in the circumstances that they\u2019d be more empathetic towards and likely to believe a white victim. Often because minorities are seen as more dramatic and capable of dealing with trauma than white victims, this is DAMAGING. I\u2019m at the point after where I don\u2019t have the energy to do much. I\u2019m being hit with depression that makes it hurt to breathe [also damage to my diaphragm]. I\u2019m terrified, dealing with being re-traumatized, and reached the point where I am too scared to leave my home. My social media\u2019s have for the most part been taken down. I can\u2019t be alone for more than a few hours without having a panic attack, not at all at night [I was home alone when it happened]. I\u2019m crying at like everything. I absolutely hate feeling so emotionally vulnerable. It\u2019s been 3 weeks since the attack and nothing has healed.\n\u2022\nIf you haven\u2019t been sexually assaulted, stop telling those of us that have been to buck up, when you stumble get back up and be strong, etc. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. If you\u2019ve never been assaulted as a hate crime, that fear is even deeper, it\u2019s different. Until your entire world comes crashing down and burns and you have to watch people rejoice in the flames while exclaiming how HAPPY they are that \u201cyour people\u201d were hurt, you don\u2019t know how we feel.\n\u2022\nMy point is this: It is IMPERATIVE to start and open the discussion about how these things intersect, and it\u2019s an important conversation to have, because for many victims, they need this kind of discussion to be opened to be able to start healing.\n\u2022"

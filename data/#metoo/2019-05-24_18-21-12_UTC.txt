Don’t touch me she pleads,
her heart heavy, her voice loud. 
but hungry eyes won’t understand,
of old habits they are proud.

Stay away she screams, 
But he’s already there. 
Groping her hips, 
And pulling her hair. 
His hands wash down,
To the curves off her breasts. 
Cravingly he feeds,
On all of her flesh.

dirty lips peck at her body, 
agonising her soul.
the devil himself he embodied,  vying for control. 
When He’s finally done, 
He wipes his mouth. 
your clothes are still undone,
But he’s had all his fun.

Thrown you are on the streets, 
Left for the dead, 
Scars on you body from all the beats,
Yet you rise yourself, lift your head. ——-“The last shred of faith in humanity will always be held” :)- #rape #metoo #instadaily #poet #cause #spread #info #help #love #life #scream #pain #broken #depressionhelp #rapeculture #hurt #cry #faith #humanity #poem #literature #english #poetsofinstagram #poets #poetsofig #poetry #poetrycommunity #poeticjustice #abuse #rapes

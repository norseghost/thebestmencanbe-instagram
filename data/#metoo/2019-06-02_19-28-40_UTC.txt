This morning in Mass, John Kyle leaned across Mack to pull me down close so he could whisper in my ear, “I like you.”⁣

💙💙💙 ⁣

From the minute we found out that our identical twins were boys, I’ve heard countless people say “boys sure do love their mamas!” But even still, y’all. I was unprepared!⁣
⁣
For years, I joked about them being my puppies; they were always wriggling into my lap and then running off to leave muddy paw prints somewhere. ⁣
⁣
These days, I call them my satellites - constantly in orbit around me, constantly checking in for many hugs and lots of kisses, constantly inviting me into their vibrant, busy world. ⁣
⁣
(Like when Mack made this bed on the floor of their room yesterday and was just beside himself for me to climb in. I’m massively pregnant and I knew if I got down there on the floor, I would just have to live there the rest of my days, so we compromised and I sat in the rocking chair and read to them while they pretended we were camping under the stars.)⁣

Raising boys feels so fraught these days, doesn’t it? Last month, I had the chance to interview Dr. Michael Reichert about his new book “How to Raise a Boy” on @sortaawesomeshow That book, you guys!! I can’t stop talking about how necessary and helpful it is for anyone looking for insight in navigating the dynamics of our #MeToo awareness culture. Even if you don’t have time to read the book, go listen to that interview. Game changer. ⁣

And I’ll just be over here, soaking up the snaggle-toothed grins and greetings of “MAMAAAA” when I open the front door and listening to the elaborate Marvel Universe/Minecraft crossovers all summer long.

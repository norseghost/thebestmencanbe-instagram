A year ago today, I released my book. The incredible amount of support, love and kindness I've received from you all is something I will forever be grateful for. I wasn’t exactly sure what the reception would be - especially by friends and family. Sure, I've had my share of people that couldn’t handle the truth, and have dropped away, but the overwhelming amount of you have solidified my faith and hope by not turning your faces away from the ugly truth and instead walking this part of my journey with me in love and kindness. The amount of people this book has helped is something I will never be able to completely wrap my head and heart around. The messages I've received from those who were touched or changed from the book from here and across the world will forever be etched on my heart. I do not regret for once writing this book or releasing it. I thank God for his grace, mercy, kindness and love in allowing this to be part of my journey, and for all the ripple effects that it has had and will continue to have through the years. I thank all of you who have helped me in my journey to get me to where I am today and thank the love of my life Paul and our boys for how their love gives me life.

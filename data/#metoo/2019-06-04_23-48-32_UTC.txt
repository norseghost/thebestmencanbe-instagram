Some people don’t consider this harassment, that it’s just a compliment, that it doesn’t hurt, that people over exaggerate. But how do comments like these make people feel? Confident? Happy? Pretty? NO. They make people feel violated and uncomfortable. What some people claim is unoffensive makes the victims feel discredited and stupid. How would you feel if this happened to you? Show some respect, and love people around you. We are all people of this earth and no one deserves to feel unsafe or challenged.

For this #RodgersAndHammersteinTuesday, how’s about a lil’ Laurey moment with this ensemble inspired by @onerebeccajones lewk in and take on Laurey in highly-praised @circleinthesquaretheatreschool #BroadwayRevival of the Classic @rodgershammerstein musical. This immersive, cutting edge production that brings this story that has been told time and time again into the #MeToo and #TimesUp era ain’t yo mama’s #Oklahoma and #RebeccaNaomiJones certainly ain’t no Shirley Jones and ain’t yo mama’s Laurey Williams ... no siree bob. Also ... that sheet music belonged to my aunt and one of my favorite people and closest friends in the whole world my Aunt Mardine ... she taught me “Oh What A Beautiful Mornin’,” “Oklahoma,” and so many other classic songs from that score and other Rodgers and Hammerstein’s staples ... R & H was definitely her thing and “our thing,” so to have her sheet music to keep and always be able to have her and those cherished memories close to me in that way is priceless. 
And remember ... As always, for all things theatre, turn to #PaigeEight 🎭💖📝8️⃣💖🎭

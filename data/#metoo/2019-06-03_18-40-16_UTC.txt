Part 4: “Shame on all of us who refuse to believe victims; undermine their experiences and trauma; poke holes in their stories; and excuse behavior in men including intoxication, uncontrollable sexual urges or desire but never once extend the same benefit of the doubt for women. Shame on all of us who have ridiculed the “What She Wore,” an exhibit highlighting the different items of clothing rape victims wore the day of their attack. Shame on us for letting such a profound statement and awareness raising initiative turn into a clever anecdote for a party or a punchline for a joke. Shame on all of us who tell women to be virtuous, keep their heads down; never talk back and accept the way things are without question  and if by some miracle how it could get better.

For a patriarchal country such as ours, steeped in religion, culture and tradition, our laws are surprisingly modern and entrenched in some gender equality policies. Ethiopia is party to a number of international and regional human rights treaties geared towards eliminating discrimination against women and providing for opportunities to fully participate and become agents of change in their lives and communities. There are obvious gaps in the law, that much is true. However, it does not in any way compare to the gap that exists between text and practice. There is a strong sense that these laws were promulgated for a community of individuals who are more modernized and capable of understanding that half the population is in dire need of equal enjoyment and protection of rights and entitlements. There is so much to be done not just in every household but in highest levels of government” Article by @thereporterethiopia #MeTooEthiopia #MeToo #Ethiopia #Ethiopian

This is absolutely ridiculous. How can you send a kid to jail for posting a picture with a gun. Did you take a picture with your dad after a successful hunting trip as a kid? You probably had the rifle in the picture. Yea that would be grounds for arrest and a fine. Played airsoft with your friends? Posting a group picture afterwards? Well if you had a gun in the picture you’d be arrested. It’s since been withdrawn but the fact someone even considered this is insane.

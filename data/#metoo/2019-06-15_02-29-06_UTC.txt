The Me Too Movement was founded in 2006. In 2017, it became a broader movement with the use of the hashtag #MeToo following the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations. This movement is not dead. These incidents are still happening. People, are still healing. Men, women, and children. It is never easy to speak out. It’s even harder to heal and find peace after such an incident has happened.

It has been 13 years since this movement was founded. It has been 2 years since it became broader. It can take the same amount of time, 2 years to 13, for a victim to find the courage to speak out.

I can’t tell you how many years it has been for me. Possibly around 20. Because when such a thing happens, you block out these memories from your mind. But not only has it been this long since it’s happened, it has also been this long for me to find the courage to speak out and finally say, #metoo 
I cannot begin to explain the agonizing pain, fear, and stress I have experienced in the past years with this internal battle. To stay silent in fear of dropping this emotional bomb on the people I care about and who are a critical part of my life. To be afraid that if I say something, what interrogation might follow. Who I might hurt. What pain it’ll cause my loved ones.

But I have finally found the courage and strength to realize, that this is my story. This is my internal battle. And if I’m not ready to tell it, I don’t have to. I don’t have to answer painful questions of who, what, when, or where that might cause me to have to relive such a traumatizing experience. This is my journey, and in order to heal, I will do what I have to. It’s not about them, it’s about me.

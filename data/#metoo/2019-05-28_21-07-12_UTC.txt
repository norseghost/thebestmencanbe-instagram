This week is Victims and Survivors of Crime Week (May 26th-June 1st). The goal of the week is to raise awareness about issues, services, and laws that are designed to help victims and survivors of crime as well as their families. It is also an opportunity to acknowledge the work that service providers do in assisting victims and survivors of crime and their families. 
In honour of Victims and Survivors of Crime Week, weâ€™ll be sharing topical articles, graphics, websites, and general information about issues, services, and laws throughout the week. 
Did you know that Victim Support is available through text and chat? Check out services offered through the Canadian Resource Center for Victims of Crime. Link in bio.

Turner only served 3 months in jail. \nTurner\u2019s father defended his son in a public letter stating that his son should not have to go to prison for \u201ctwenty minute of action.\u201d Over 90,000 people signed a petition thanks to the hard work of volunteers who created a coalition to make the recall vote a possibility. 60% of voters voted to have Persky removed, something that has not happened in California in 86 years.#judgepersky #brockturner #rapeculture #itsonus #nomore #sexualassault #victimblaming #metoo #breakthecycle #defendinnocence #saam #mamabeareffect #consent"

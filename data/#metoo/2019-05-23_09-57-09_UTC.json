                        "text": "#FoodForThought \nI always find it laughable that the concept of harassment often starts and ends with the sexual. Theoretically there are several ways one (man and woman) can be harassed; sexual, discriminatory, psychological, physical, personal, religious, gender, racial, age based and power. \nIf you want to really talk about harassment, start not with a specific incident - start with the very basic journey a woman has to endeavour. The first time a man licks his lips when he watches a girl sit in a car with her father in the driving seat. The time she was called \u201cqiyamat ki nishani\u201d while walking through liberty because her 4 inch wide dupatta wasn\u2019t hiding her bosom too well. Implore why she chooses to bite her tongue at work while advocating her own ability to do her job well while being up against a man - thereby automatically more potent than her. The time when her employer thinks it\u2019s okay to crack a \u201csexy\u201d joke with her single female employee because she doesn\u2019t seem to mind. The time a cousin or a male family member rubs their hand on her arm because he didn\u2019t have another route within the living room to cross her. Or the time her mother indicated she shouldn\u2019t leave the car because despite her shalwar Kurta, the men will devour her through the glare in their eyes and the hunger drooling from their filthy mouths. \nComing forward with a matter entails a courage unknown to man (not the biological penis ridden man, but the proverbial man). The level of endurance one has to imbibe in the face of a delayed payment and an argument that reads; \u201cbut why do you need money anyways?\u201d Or when a man leaves a sticky note on your car side view mirror with his number and a description of what he would like to do to your body. \nThere\u2019s no agenda behind the post, just a very simple ask - be empathic. Call a spade, a spade.\n\n#spokenword #poetry #poems #poet #poetsociety #poetsinautumn #write #writer #ridaswritingcorner #ridakhalidbhutta #poet #writing #empathy #may #harassment #metoo #stopridiculingharassment #ridakhalid #thelahoritroubadour"

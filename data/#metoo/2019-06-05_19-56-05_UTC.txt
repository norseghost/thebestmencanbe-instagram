I met this man only a few months ago when we met up to talk about him hosting my event .. .
.

I can honestly say Paul you are one of the nicest people I have met with a huge heart. 
Iâ€™m very honoured to announce Paul is now an ambassador for our #katiecares Domestic abuse charity.
Paul will also be educating me on domestic abuse in gay relationships so together we can help even more people who need it ðŸ’œ

Iâ€™m really looking forward to the future and Iâ€™m so proud to be working with you xxx

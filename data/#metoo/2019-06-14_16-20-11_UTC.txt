The year was 2016, he was 20, she was 17 caucasian, both underage but met inside a popular college bar, he used a friend's ID to get in, she wasn't carded at all.

She says they kissed on the dancefloor, he ALLEGEDLY lifted up her skirt and sexually assaulted her, he then led her out of the club "stumbling" to his crib a few blocks away, he then holds her down and rapes her. 
He says she didn't seem intoxicated at all, he invited her to the crib, they messed around but never had intercourse, a rape kit was done, a vaginal swab showed NO SEMEN or DNA of HIS (other men was) , surveillance footage doesnt show her stumbling out of club being led away by him (like she claimed), surveillance footage also shows they were only in his apt. less than 5 mins before heading back to the club together (not that a rape can't happen in 5 mins, but it paints a very different picture than the one she is claiming). Fast forward to 3 days ago, an all white, mostly female jury found #AlbertWilson guilty of rape. Albert just graduated college, and although this was his first offense (with reasonable doubt and no evidence against him), he was sentenced to 12 years in prison, LIFETIME probation and must register as a sex offender.

It's sad when within the same time frame you have someone like #BrockTurner who was actually caught IN THE ACT sexually assaulting a woman and only served 3 months of a 6 MONTH SENTENCE 😒 with 3 years probation 🤦🏾‍♂️ This is what racial injustice we talk about that you say don't exist.

This is the injustice we talk about when men loose everything after being wrongfully accused of rape.

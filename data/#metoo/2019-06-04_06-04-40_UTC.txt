Why join us Friday? Being a survivor of sexual assualt, just as so many other men and women in our community, I understand the necessity and significance of programs such as @monarchsccounty . 
This might be heavy reading, but it is an unfortunate reality of many.  The aftermath and trauma is a road you never imagined traveling. The world after often feels isolating, confusing, scary. And while generally the outside world is given the gift to move on, the survivor lives in it and has to get through triggers for a very long time in different ways while healing and there is no time frame given for when they can expect and end, and finally be free.

Please join us at @yosowellness Friday, June 7th as we support Monarch services a program that offers love, advocates and supports survivors of sexual assualt, domestic abuse and human trafficking. 
Believe it or not, all of these horrific acts are still happening everyday.  It’s programs like @monarchsccounty that helps so many of us to keep taking steps forward. 
Your support at our Yōso Grand Reopening and Fundraiser as a result will provide the gift for so many others to detour from the unimaginable road and find that beautiful road to travel.

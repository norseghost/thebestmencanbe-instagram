Taking time to reflect on my actions and mindset is very important to me. I personally feel if Iâ€™m constantly doing things and donâ€™t give myself a chance to reflect and think about where Iâ€™m headed, then really what am I working towards? Iâ€™ve had to be really honest with myself in the past and realize I was on the wrong path. Itâ€™s not easy realizing youâ€™ve been holding yourself back, when you were blaming everyone else the whole time. But itâ€™s possible to change. You have to want to be even greater. This version of me wasnâ€™t built overnight; it took experience, pain, depression, and insecurities. I had to go through a lot to be where I am now. Be real with yourself and change for the better.

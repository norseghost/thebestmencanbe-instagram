A feared unit of Sudan's security forces raped women as they dispersed pro-democracy protesters camped outside the military's headquarters 12 days ago, witnesses have told the BBC.
.
The military authorities deny the allegations, but Khalid, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, told the BBC about the sexual assaults he saw on the day of the brutal crackdown.
.
When the shooting began shortly after the morning Muslim prayers he ran for cover with another protester to a nearby building. But as the two terrified young men hid in a room on an upper floor from the chaos outside, they heard screaming and crept out to peer down the stairwell to see what was going on.
"We saw six soldiers that were raping two girls," he told the BBC.
Khalid and his friend tried to intervene, shouting "go away, go away" at the armed men, part of the Rapid Support Force (RSF), more popularly known as the Janjaweed, who responded by shooting towards them.â€œ

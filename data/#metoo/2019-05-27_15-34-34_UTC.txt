TW: sexual assault 
While the beauty of Islam is often misrepresented in media and current times, there is always something to be said about the prevalence of sexual assault in the Muslim community that is not addressed at all. These attacks are often done by those placed in a position of trust and are severely underreported leaving many Muslims dealing with the severity of their experience alone. I can speak to this in my own life. While we all remember each other and care for one another in the last 10 days of Ramadan, I would choose to remind everyone to check in on their brothers and sisters and remember to believe survivors.

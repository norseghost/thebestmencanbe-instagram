I love how supportive chickens are of each other. 
When I decided I didnâ€™t want to support an egg, the world told me it was bad and I should feel guilty. That my duty was to create an unwanted human and nurture it through incubation, which includes not only months and months of discomfort, but potentially life-threatening complications. .
And THEN to either allow other people to take it from me, or be attached to a man I didnâ€™t want to be attached to forever, while sacrificing my life to care for this being I never wanted. 
So guess what? I wanted it to never come into being. I am deeply grateful to all the chickens who supported me. 
And then, ya know what? I would forget about it. For long periods of time. When someone brought up pregnancy, Iâ€™d remember, oh - I was pregnant too. It didnâ€™t bother me. I didnâ€™t have strong emotions around it. It was just something that happened. And I was relieved.

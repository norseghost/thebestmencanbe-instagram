Ok I need to be asleep ASAP but I’m so excited to be here in #WestHollywood this #iLGBTQ+ weekend & with so much freedom as a #queer #intersex #nonbinary person in the City of Angels.. A great sprawling dream factory  that actively has a @lapride MONTH. I grew up in Wiltshire, England (like the Midwest here in USA with more sheep, Stonehenge & moonshine cider). I was homophobically  bullied most days in High School. Where are those bullies now? Not living in #Hollywood building a post #MeToo #NewHollywood!! I’ve never felt this much freedom or more like myself! I just turned 50!! @itgetsbetter . To all those living with oppression, hatred & intolerance. We see you, we love you, we are with you in spirit & LOVE. So much evil from organised religions- how dare they say our ❤️ & sex is wrong. Be proud🌈. Don’t take their sh**. Be true to yourself and Be The Change 🤟🏽💪🏽🙏🏽🌏🌎🌍 @gayweho @wehocity @lalgbtcenter Stand TOGETHER #WeWillWin PS thanks @madebylondon & @princesspaperbag 🤟🏽🥰 PPS thanks @percolate_tea for the best #Matcha #Boba in LA! My little treat for rocking it at my audition today! ...I lost my childhood acting dream to a #MeToo paedo director ‘boyfriend’ when I was under 16 & lost my 20s TV directing career to #addictions. #RecoveryRocks #SoberIsSexy I’M BACK 🖕🏼#haters #beagle #SevenGraham #enby #actor #dreamer @generation_hustle

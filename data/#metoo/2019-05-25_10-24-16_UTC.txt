Make America Great again...
.
.
To exactly what time-period?
.
.
Let’s go back to when we got the Natives drunk and stole their land....Bring some Ciroc 🍺
.
.
How about we go back to the years of slavery....Higher profit margins 📈
.
.
How about the times when women couldn’t vote (which was just 100 years ago).....It’s not ‘Sexual Harassment’ if we suppress their power to speak up 🔊🙅‍♀️
.
.
If someone handed me a travel machine to go back in-time I’d probably go back to the extent of my High-School days.
.
.
Other than that, there’s not a a time-period I’d have the COURAGE to go back to as an African American man.
.
.
And that’s why I aggressively seek out souls that are committed to doing their bit on making this world a tad-bit better 🌏💫
.
.
My last couple interviews exposed some ugly truths about what goes on in this country. We have much to fix.

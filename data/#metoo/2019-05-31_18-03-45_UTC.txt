#HerRepost from @taniaomotayo -  On the 28th of January 2018 I attended a Vision Board Tea party at @oasismedspang by Her Network little did I know that I was speaking the next year of my life into existence. We were told to cut out images of things we wanted and to present our boards.

I cut out something about Joy, a baby, an engagement ring, marriage, Forbes, Growth for Ziva, A watch ( as mine was stolen a few weeks beforehand) amongst other things. My 2017 was horrible and filled with disappointments, it seemed like every time I took a step forward something would drag me ten steps back.

I was kinda over everything therefore I was so hopeful that 2018 would be my year. Now looking back it seems like God was sitting there in the room with me while I presented my board because he literally answered all my prayers and blessed me with everything I asked for. I came across this video on my phone and thought to share. Moral of my long story is speak everything you want into the universe, be very intentional and specific with your prayers and never stop having faith. No matter how difficult it may be or how bad things get always know that when it is your time God will fulfill all that your heart desires. . . ðŸ’•

The only thing remaining is the one billion dollars on my boardðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£. But I have faith that one day God will surprise me ðŸ˜Š

Good Morning My Fierce Fabulous Family  its Motivation Monday here's Today's quote 
This is an interesting quote which throws light on the strength of a lion as compared to the meekness of a sheep and motivates us to follow the lifestyle of the former. Lion is the king of jungle, strong, confident, aware, self-sufficient, can hunt for itself and defend itself. Whereas sheep just eats, sleeps and follows the shepherd to be guided to food and water. Like a lion, each one of us has a fire within which is ready to devour the silly constraints created by weakling all around us. So if we can awaken the beast within us, why should we choose to live huddled up in a mediocre crowd, instead we must lead them

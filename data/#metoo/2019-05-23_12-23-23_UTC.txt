My older son asked the meaning of this expression, yesterday. “Having an elephant in the room”, I explained, means that there is an obvious problem or difficult situation that people refuse to acknowledge and in which attempts at discussion are prohibited and ignored, if not  punished. He recognized it pretty quickly and we were able to identify some ways to endure, until it is possible to safely exit.
A scapegoat is typically the one who needs to examine or reconcile the matter.  RATS 😡  I forgot to add “disconnection” to my graphic- that shitty feeling of separation from others, ourselves, and #reality ☠️ •• My son readily related the example of my relatives gathering with his father and his brother and without me— and everyone behaving as if I do not exist — the unspoken rule to not mention me or things that relate to me.  He articulated a pretty sophisticated understanding of these politics. This led us straight into a discussion about how assertions by “the invisible army” are intended to quiet us from sharing honestly. 
I shared my experience of how the 🐘 has consistently been a symptom of sick relationships— in which one or more people are addicts and/or abusers, requiring complicit denial of a thing, event, or person.  The threat of truth speaking or having feelings is real. ➡️The room with the 🐘 is the least safe place for truth speakers and deep feelers. #elephantintheroom #empath #thestruggleisreal #beware 🤐🙈🙉🙊 #rapeculture #rape #metoo #invisiblearmy  #alcoholic #culture

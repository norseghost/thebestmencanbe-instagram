Happy Sunday morning Motivation! 
Put the sound on.
You see a tire but for me I see the obstacles: sexual harasser, wrongful termination, stereotypes, held backs, incorrect pay,  discriminations, nay-sayers, mental health, disappointments, hurt and more that I won't let defeat me.

Plus, I have great motivators, my  B First Boxing coach CJ and my workout family screaming, "Push through sherry.  Stay and fight you got it,  don't let it defeat you."
My faith, workouts, Yoga and great support helps to keep me rising to the top.
Don't let your obstacles defeat you.
Decide today to keep going and pushing through.
How are you planning to push your obstacles out your way? 
Keep rising!

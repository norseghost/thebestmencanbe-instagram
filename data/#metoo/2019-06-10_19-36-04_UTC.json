                        "text": "Today marks the beginning of National Men's Health Week \ud83c\udf24 & in celebration we are dedicating this week to our male followers. Although we prefer not to pigeon-hole people on an individual level including gender, sometimes it's important to talk about our differences in order to both explore & celebrate them together as human beings. Like women, men too are constantly under the pressure of societal 'norms' & stereotypes, although this phenomena tends to get far less airtime, particularly in the post #metoo era. The current zeitgeist feels like a time in which the world is starting to find its balance in terms of establishing more fluid gender roles, as well as opening dialogue about the mutual respect & understanding that we all deserve. In Sophrology I can definitely notice a change, where more men are asking for support & that\u2019s wonderful news. Men are definitely feeling as much under pressure as women do, even if the type & causes of the pressures they describe are often different. As human beings, we all aspire to be loved, to be heard. Being the mother of a little boy, I see it every day at the playground: when a boy cries after he falls, he is often told that everything is OK. Culturally, boys are often told that they need to be strong & tough. In other words, from an early age, we are teaching our boys to be strong in a way that doesn\u2019t include connection to themselves & how they feel. Not being heard, not being given the freedom to feel from an early age can have a massive impact on the way men contribute to the world. It is so important that all men & boys have the support they need to live healthier, longer & more fulfilling lives. It can be tough for men to ask for help but if you don\u2019t ask when you need it things don't get better. So please do ask. We're here to listen.

Indian girls are RAPED\n.\n.\nBefore the #metoo movement could gather rage and empathy enough for women out there, there was a burst of #notallmen and of course a small percentage of women who misused the movement etc etc.\n.\n.\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Every country I go to, every new person or cab driver I talk to, asks me where I\u2019m from.. and I say India.\n\u2014\nIndia is my country, my pride. \u2014\nBut statistically, 60% of the time I say \u201cI\u2019m from India\u201d, the immediate response is \u201cOh! I\u2019ve heard india is not safe for women\u201d or \u201cgirls are raped in India\u201d.\n.\n.\n\u2018Now hold one one second\u2019, I tell myself and I choose my next words VERY carefully. I explain with patience that yes, it\u2019s a painful truth- that unforgivable, #castration and #deathpenalty worthy crime. It takes away EVERYTHING from a woman. It\u2019s something that a person can NEVER overcome in one lifetime (given that she wasn\u2019t killed in the process)\n.\n.\nBut also. It\u2019s a population game. Not every woman in India is raped and NO, it\u2019s NOT something we\u2019re \u201cused to\u201d. Come on!\n.\n.\nIt\u2019s funny I had to type the above sentence on a public forum.. but I\u2019m tired of being asked. #everywhere I go.\nAnd what do I say? I mean my country is BEAUTIFUL. My people are amazing.\n.\n.\nAnd when people tell me that I\u2019m really \u201cbrave\u201d that being an #indiangirl I have the courage to travel alone etc.. I feel terrible. \nI love travelling. Being called brave just because I\u2019m doing something I love? I\u2019m confused: am I supposed to feel good about it?\n.\n.\nAnd once we get into that topic.. there\u2019s a slight tremor in people\u2019s voice when they ask me..\u201d So... have you been...umm.. raped?\u201d\n.\n.\nHonestly, I just turn up the volume on my headphones and pretend that the conversation never happened.\nJust like in real life. .\n.\nI wish I could reach out.. reach out to everyone in the world and tell them that India is so much more than a #rapenation \nIndian girls are NOT used to being cat called or raped. No, we\u2019re not used to it. Not now, not ever.\n.\n.\nOk then.\n#womenwhotravel \n#breakthestigma\ud83d\udc9a \n#victimsofrape \n#breakthestereotype \n#india \n#incredibleindiaoffical \n#blogger \n#notsafeforwomen \n#bold \n#courage \n#stereotype \n#lifestruggles"

I used to hold your hand
And feel a scar you had from when you were a baby.
It was an odd, familiar feeling
But a part of loving you nonetheless.
And when you left 
I didn’t have to miss that feeling
Because you left me with plenty of scars
To call my own.
They cover my mind,
Ruining things I once loved.
You ruined bike rides 
On a warm summer day.
You ruined my favorite shirt
And freedom.
You ruined the appeal of love
And physically showing it.
You ruined our relationship,
And the one that followed it.
You stole my peace of mind
And ruined my sleep cycle.
You ruined Billy Joel
And Queen’s “another one bites the dust”
Because it’s what you said after you committed your crime.
You ruined the way I carried myself
And the vanilla scent I loved.
You ruined us.
You ruined compliments
And motel rooms.
But more than anything,
When *** ***** me,
You ruined me.

The #feminist messaging is strong. Critics may decry the film as #commodityfeminism but for a multi billion dollar company, I felt Disney took a big swing. This is one way that media companies are responding to consumer activism in the era of #metoo

As my coauthors and I have found, #Disneyprincess films like to embody the films “main message” in the flagship song. Jasmine’s new song “Speechless” is deliberate in its timing and intention. Children will code the song one way; adults another. Swipe for the lyrics. *

Did you doubt that what happened to you was sexual assault because you knew the perpetrator? If so, you’re not alone. Knowing your assaulter adds another set of challenges, including mutual friendships and peer pressure not to report. You may receive less support since your case doesn’t fit the image that most people still have of what sexual assault actually is. If you got along with the perpetrator or trusted them prior to the crime, you may be blaming yourself or feeling ashamed. This a common response. In order to dispel this sexual assault myth, more people have to report the crime.

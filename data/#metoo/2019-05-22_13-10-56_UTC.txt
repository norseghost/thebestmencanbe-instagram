Positive thinking is proactive. It doesn't ignore the difficult parts of life, but rather views them with faith that it all works out.

Wishful thinking is viewing the world through a lens of what you wished it looked. It can make us stay in situations that done support us. It can delude us into avoiding the difficult but necessary feelings that move us to change and evolve.

Knowing the difference between the two is essential for our growth. Forcing the sunshine avoids the fertile, life giving rains that sustain us in the long run.

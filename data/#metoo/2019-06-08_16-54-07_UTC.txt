These are pictures from The Monument Quilt, which is the the first national monument honoring survivors of sexual violence. It has stories from 3,000 people and itâ€™s beautiful. Thank you @upsettingrapeculture for working hard for six years to display this and I wish I could have seen it in person. #iseeyou #ibelieveyou #youarenotalone #noestassola #noestassolo #noestassolx #metoo

This afternoon, @nadia_murad_taha alongside some of the Vietnamese victims went to view the gallery space in London, where the commemorative sculpture will be displayed. 
From Wednesday 12th June, the sculpture will be available to view, along with an exhibition on the Vietnam War and the Lai Dai Han, at the gallery at 10 Hanover Street in central London. 
The sculpture will be unveiled by Nadia Murad, the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize winner, at Church House, Westminster this evening!

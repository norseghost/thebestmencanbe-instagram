                        "text": "The second the staging of Bitter Wheat was announced it was of course controversial- why is a man writing a black farce about Harvey Weinstein? Why in the face of #metoo is a man wanting to write about this ? And what a good question. Throughout it all I asked myself is why ? \nI bought a ticket because I wanted to see #johnmalkovich and the play is written by #Davidmamet and I am perfectly able to think for myself. \nOne word for it is OBVIOUS and one phrase is THE ART OF THE BLEEDIN OBVIOUS . \nWe watched a sex abuser doing exactly what we have read, seen, heard and followed about him, despite both Malkovich and #doonmackichan being brilliant in its execution. \nWeinstein is still free, 18 months later. It may well be that Mamet is showing us our hypocrisy in how abusers seem to survive and he suggests not only do they survive but inevitably go on to thrive again. Here lies the rub , the play doesn\u2019t challenge our morality or question why abuse is so easily hidden and question why it seems nothing happens even when it is made transparent; if the audience is anything to go by,it is laughed off and here our subject is,after all, a prolific sexual predator and abuser, nothing seems to be taken that seriously by the audience as they guffawed and chuckled their way through it all!! Even in the end many gave it a standing ovation. \nI can only imagine Weinstein is smiling, relieved at it all , as we appear to enjoy his story - we avoid the difficulties, deny our attitudes to women it seems by making light of it all! He is no doubt just sitting in a waiting chamber ready to go again , given enough time passing. I am therefore left questioning whether Mamet and his play become complicit in helping make possible Weinstein\u2019s eventual return. #bitterwheat #davidmamet #garricktheatre #directedbydavidmamet #worldpremier #westend  #westendtheatre #theatre #acting #actorsonactors"

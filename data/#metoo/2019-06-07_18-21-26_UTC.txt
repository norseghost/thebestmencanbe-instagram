Some enchanted evening it was last night — so impeccably temperate in Central Park after the misery of a too-hot day — for @publictheaterny’s extraordinary new summer production of Shakespeare’s comedic “Much Ado About Nothing,” replete with an all-black cast in a contemporary take on gender roles (nodding to #metoo) and infidelity; a comedy of errors in judgment and deception, gloriously and hilariously performed by a stellar cast across the board,  with R&B and gospel numbers and so much love in the air. (Thank you, Cissie, my dear, dear friend who I adore, for graciously thinking of me.♥️) #shakespeareinthepark #the public theater #joepapp #delacortetheater #centralpark

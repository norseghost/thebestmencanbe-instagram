Although I Didn't Get A Chance To Attend @americanblackfilmfestival In It's Entirety I'm More Than Grateful For The Portion I Was Able To Take Part In & To Have Been Amongst Some Of The Greats ESPECIALLY The Women Of Color In The TV/Film Industry That Are Creating & Giving Opportunities To Aspiring Women Of Color Creators Like Myself!!

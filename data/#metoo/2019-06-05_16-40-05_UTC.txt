Today I am going to share something very personal that I have contemplated sharing for a long time. Why am I sharing this on a social media platform? Because we don't talk about it often. Because it is taboo. Because it is an ugly truth. .
 I was a sexually molested child. It started when I was around 4 or 5 - I don't even remember because it was so long back - and yet it seems like it was just yesterday.....he would come home often. As with most cases, he was not just very known to the family - everyone looked up to him the most because he was a close relative. My parents trusted him. After sharing a drink with my Appa, late in the night after everyone slept the nightmare would begin....we weren't taught about good or bad touch then. But it didn't feel right. Something felt wrong. Very very horribly wrong. I didn't cry, I didn't know what to do, or who to talk to. But I knew enough to know that something was not right......it went on for years. ....I felt I was doing something wrong for years.....why me? Why was he touching me? How I wish, I'd wake up from this horrible nightmare and go back to school....I was a good student - not your first ranker, but did reasonably well and always sang right through my school and college. Was an inherently a happy child....only I knew the private hell that I was dealing with......
.
I don't remember for how many years it went on - but one day in Class 8, we heard that he'd died. .
Why am I talking about this today on a public platform, some 30 years after it has happened? Because no child should feel that he/she did something wrong and that is why this is happening. Because childhood is the happiest part of one’s life - it shouldn’t be spent on battling horrors, pretending that everything is normal and shuddering at the thought of facing your tormentor again. Because we should make every effort to begin to end child sex abuse. Because.....

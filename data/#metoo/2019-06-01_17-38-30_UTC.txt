Watercolor Pooh Bear 
Iâ€™m happy to say goodbye to May! It was an exhausting month filled with lots of tears, doubts, and stormy weather. Although it was an emotional month, I was reminded of things I tend to forget . Like how things happen on Gods timing and not in mine. Or that I friends and family who love me and are there to support me, be shoulder to cry on, and help me in any way they can. When youâ€™re sad or depressed you tend hermit up and get stuck inside your own head. I need to remember open up and allow all the love to pour into me, because thatâ€™s when I feel the happiest. ðŸ˜Œ

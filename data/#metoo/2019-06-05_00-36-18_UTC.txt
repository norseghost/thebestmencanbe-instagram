Tomorrow @allthehealthy and I start raising $$ to meet our year-end goals for our newly launched 501c3 org, @warriorsbybtfp! Until now we’ve have been doing our own crowdfunding, soliciting our family, friends, and fellow activists to keep the page running. But it’s not enough! We need to raise 30k in 30 days to keep the lights on & meet our year end goals.

Now we need YOUR help to provide survivor services, resources, calls to action, and education to #EndAllAbuse

Stay tuned for our snazzy fundraiser video TOMORROW!

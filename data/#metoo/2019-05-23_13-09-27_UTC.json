After his car wreck, he was bedridden for nearly 4 years. Cannabis assisted him in his emotional and neurological struggles to where he found himself capable of using an electric bike once in a while, swimming as often as he could, and heading out to our family farm in Texas to visit his brother. However, the pain and agony of the pain was one thing, losing his independence was truly the icing on that fucked up cake. At 31 and having always taken care of myself when not well or feeling broken, it\u2019s not easy to ask for help. Especially from my partner who has triggers around being \u201cbossed around\u201d by his family. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at all \u201cbossy\u201d, even I was a business owner and an ACTUAL boss I wasn\u2019t even bossy... but, triggers are triggers. An experience can be simply similar to a triggering past situation yet our subconscious will accept it as the exact same circumstance and react unless we actively #practice #emotionalintelligence (#EQ ) and awareness of triggers. \nAnyways - please send #healingvibes as this is quite a thing to heal from after so much damage for so long and is keeping me from connecting and working with others, for now. On the flip side; this gives me an opportunity to focus on my book \ud83d\udcd3\u270d\ud83c\udffb! Happy Thursday to All & remember... i am human | so are you \ud83d\udc9c\n\nWearing my encouraging, comfortable, and sexy #JustStrong cropped jacket \ud83d\udcaa - Use my code SHASEITZ10 to get $$$ off your purchase at JustStrong.com \ud83e\udd18You won\u2019t regret it, I friggin\u2019 love this company!!! \ud83d\ude0e  #thursdaymorning #prayerflags #stupa #dharmakaya"

If you aren’t doing what makes your soul shine, then what are you doing!? -
Now I realize that sounds cheesy, like what does that even mean? how does one “make their soul shine”. (Insert eye roll)

You can take it for what you want, but to me, I think it means doing what puts a smile on your face most of the time. Not every second of every day, that’s unrealistic. It’s ok to have moments where you aren’t smiling too. But if you find yourself almost never being able to smile, it’s time to stop doing things you hate or don’t like. It’s time to get out of the situations that are causing yourself damage. Get a plan together and start doing things that put a smile on your beautiful face.

.a quote from a blog a friend sent me to read.... “Guys, life is too short to live unhappily. Quit that job you hate (but have a plan), leave that toxic relationship (and don’t make the same mistakes again), eat the extra slice of pizza (then take the stairs home) and for the love of God, BUY THE DAMN SHOES. 😉 (But maybe sleep on it?) HAHA. I never sleep on it, I just buy them…

You get what I mean, right? So, I’m leaving this quote here for you:
“Do what makes your soul shine” “

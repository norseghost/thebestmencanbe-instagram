How to Be a Woman in a Manâ€™s World (5/6)

In retrospect, I wish I had ended the project sooner given what I know now; I was so caught off-guard because we had friendly discourse previous to starting the project and due to self doubt I continued with the project longer than I wanted to. I knew something was inherently wrong, but because as a woman - I've been taught from a very early age to hold space and tolerate a great deal more than is acceptable - I started to doubt what I instinctively felt was inappropriate. And men or those in positions of power and privilege, are very often given a pass for their behaviour generally seen as unacceptable for women. Ultimately, I trusted my instincts and took the necessary steps to end the project. .

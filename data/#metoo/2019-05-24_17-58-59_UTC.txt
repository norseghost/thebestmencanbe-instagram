Harvey Weinstein is said to have reached a tentative $44 million settlement to resolve lawsuits filed by women who accused him of sexual misconduct. The agreement — which is separate from the criminal charges against him — would divide the money among alleged victims, former Weinstein Co. employees and studio creditors, and plaintiffs’ lawyers fees. It is less than half of what was initially discussed as a victims’ fund with the New York attorney general’s office last year, but nevertheless it is symbolic — because civil lawsuits are one of the main avenues by which Mr. Weinstein could be held responsible for his alleged actions. Mr. Weinstein still faces criminal charges for rape and other sex crimes, which he has denied, and his trial is scheduled to begin in September.

UPDATE: This post had been updated to more accurately reflect the details of the settlement, which will be covered by insurance policies if the current agreement is finalized. Visit the link in bio to read more.

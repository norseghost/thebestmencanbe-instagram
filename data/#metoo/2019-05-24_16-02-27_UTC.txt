There are many understandable reasons why a child victim of sexual abuse is not likely to tell anyone about their abuse.

Often, the abusive adult will convince the child that they wonâ€™t be believed or that they are somehow responsible for the abuse and will be punished for it. 
People who abuse children may offer a combination of gifts or treats and threats about what will happen if the child says 'no' or tells someone.
Sometimes the abuser will convince the child that he or she enjoyed it and wanted it to happen.

Remember that there are no situations where a child is responsible for any sexual interaction with a more powerful child or adult. ..

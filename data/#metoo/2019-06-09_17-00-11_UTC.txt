When we travel we lose pieces of ourselves while finding something new. You never know how a trip will end even if that means reliving painful pieces of your past in a very real way. ⠀

I took this picture the morning after I was assaulted. I was on my way to see a piece of history that has been of interest since childhood. Her bravery in a time of extreme hate gave me the courage to walk out of my hotel room that morning. ⠀
⠀
While it was not easy I knew in my heart that if I stayed locked behind a door until it was time to go to the airport I would have done no justice. In the end, I got to fulfill one of my dreams, I got to understand a hero of mine a little more and for that, I'm thankful for the courage she had to leave behind her mind even when the horrors of war took over her land. ⠀

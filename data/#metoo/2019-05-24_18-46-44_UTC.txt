Speaking about Trump, West revealed that he has never voted, and also declared that “Liberals bully people who are Trump supporters!” Later, while discussing his “fear” of being a man in the #MeToo era, West says he’s trying to fight the “stigma” of being a Trump supporter. “This is like my thing with Trump — we don’t have to feel the same way, but we have the right to feel what we feel.”

Doing laundry on Lyndale and walked by this scene. 
People lined up for a fundraider for the The Sexual Violence Center of Miinneapolis. $100 and $200 flash tattoos in the "Still Not Asking For It" theme, proceeds to the SVC. Pretty cool. @mplstattoo is a women owned and operated tattoo shop in Minneapolis, MN. ‚ù§  I've never been tattooed here but I can see spending some money here in the future. Women who use their skills to speak up and help others be heard have #POWER and I can put my $$$ behind that.

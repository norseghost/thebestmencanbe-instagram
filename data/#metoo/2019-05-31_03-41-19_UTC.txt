As a victim of sexual assault and survivor of sexual abuse, I am appalled by what is happening in Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, and Illinois.
I have questions and demand answers!

This isn’t about anyone’s orientation regarding pro-life or pro-choice anymore. This is about political agency over the female body. This is about power — ripping it from the rightful owner. 
These bans completely disregard, even ridicule, the experience of victims. How dare these government officials hold themselves so righteously while diminishing the long term impacts of trauma on women’s and children’s lives?! @npr @plannedparenthood @ppact @pplapeeradvocates @aclu @shoutyourabortion #MeToo

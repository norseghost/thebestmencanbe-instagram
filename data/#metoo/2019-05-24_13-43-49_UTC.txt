This law already passed in Texas. Agencies can now legally deny adoptions to same sex couples. In foster care, kids are assigned to certain agencies- that means all the kids assigned to those agencies have a higher chance of never being adopted and spending their childhoods in groups homes and treatment centers. No hugs, no siblings, no parents, no family dinners, no sports teams, and a VERY small chance of ever graduating highschool. This is how much Republicans care about our American children.

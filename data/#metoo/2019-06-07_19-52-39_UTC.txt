Happy National Donut Day!!! Life is all about balance, so eat a donut and don’t feel guilty. I eat donuts like once a year and it’s usually on donut day. It’s a nice treat. Krispy Kreme is giving away free donuts with no purchase and Dunkin’ is giving away donuts with every beverage purchase. Some people like fancy donuts but I’m more of a simple glazed donut 🍩. Have you hade your donut today?

Even though she was awful and I was miserable, I still wanted to stay because made me think what was happening to me was “true love”. It’s scary to think about all the abusive behavior I let slide because I didn’t know any better. Unlearning all the bullshit she put in my head has definitely been a process and it’s something I have to work on daily. I deserve kindness. I deserve to feel safe. I deserve to feel respected. —————-
(also yes this is an old poem, I am so exhausted and have nothing new that’s ready to be posted. stay tuned for when I get a good night sleep though.)

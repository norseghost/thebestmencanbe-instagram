R. Kelly has been charged with 11 new counts of sexual assault and abuse in Illinois.

The 11 new charges come three months after the singer was charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in February. Kelly also now faces three counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse upon a victim between the ages of 13 and 16.

I looked up to this singer growing up, as did many other teens. I constantly listened to his songs at dances, parties, and hangouts. No more. For a role model to become a monster in front of my eyes is horrifying to see. For his victims to finally find justice is imperative. We can’t get tired of talking about sexual assault because it’s still happening all around us to young girls, young boys, toddlers, college students, and adults well into their 50s. It’s happening everywhere, and we can’t stop it if we don’t keep talking about it. #rkelly #sexualassault #metoo #sexualabuse #nomore

I am being very vulnerable in this video sharing my story of how I was sexually abused. Click on the link on my bio to watch the full video. Please help share this video to reach and encourage others to make their voice heard too. Let's come together and put a STOP to this issue. If you are someone who has experienced sexual abuse/assault I'm so sorry it happens to you too. Thank you guys so much for being on this journey with me.ðŸ’•ðŸŒ±

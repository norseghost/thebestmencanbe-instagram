I love when my clients have an ah-ha moment!  When that occurs, it is like all the pieces of a puzzle begin to come together and everything makes sense.  The momentum increases and results are seen.
.
As a Coach, I work with my clients to identify their goals ~ whether it is (just to name a few)
â€¢to not wake up each morning and dread the life they are leading
â€¢have a better work/life balance (and boundaries!)
â€¢make a career advancement or a change â€¢make decisions aligned with their values (or to first learn and identify what are their values)
â€¢to trust in themselves and the decisions they make â€¢limiting beliefs (imposter complex)
â€¢the importance of self-care â€¢time management
â€¢to transform a goal/dream into reality
â€¢learn to like/love/value themselves .
Once the goals are identified we work together on how my client can break her goals down into baby steps so they are achievable as well as how to not sabotage herself.  In doing this work, I serve to help with accountability, to challenge when needed, to be supportive, to listen, to look at situations/problems differently, and to laugh together.
.
My clients include women who are
â€¢in transition whether it is ^returning to the workforce
^children going to school or leaving home
^becoming a couple and not losing herself ^becoming single and all that entails
â€¢women advancing in the workplace, developing their leadership skills, learning how to have a seat at the table, finding a new career path
â€¢stay-at-home moms â€¢wondering what is their purpose

My coaching is virtual.  This means you and I can be anywhere and as long as we have an internet connection, we can connect.  It is a huge timesaver for clients in that they do not need to take the time out of their already busy day to drive to and from their appointments.  I also have an office in the northwest suburbs of Chicago for those nearby and who still prefer the face-to-face session.

I am passionate about the work I do.  I believe in empowering women to believe in themselves, improve their lives and live their life.  Let me know if you are interested in learning more about the work I do.  Feel free to DM me or click on the link in my bio @denisestyer ðŸ’œ

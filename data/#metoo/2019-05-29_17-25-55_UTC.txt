Vishaka .
.
A 9-month-old baby was a child bride in Rajasthan. Let this soak in for a minute. 
The year was 1992, when Bhanwari Devi a member of Women Development Project, a government run initiative, took up the issue of child marriage. She, along with the police, tried to stop the marriage of a 9-month-old baby (belonging to a higher caste; Gujjar) on the day of Akha Teej and was successful. 
Unfortunately, her success was short lived as the marriage took place the next day and resulted in the village boycotting and ostracizing her family. 
This was not punishment enough as she and her husband were attacked by a group of Gujjar men who gang raped her brutally. Bhanwari Devi’s episode brought on a flurry of media recognition and condemnation of the event. However, the criminal system while adjudicating the case failed her and the men were acquitted. 
Her incident however brought to light the unsafe conditions and hardships that a woman has to face while working. This fueled numerous women’s groups to file a PIL for enforcement of fundamental rights of a woman. 
The Supreme Court of India recognized the need for a framework of guidelines to promote gender equality and identify sexual harassment. 
With due regard to the fundamental rights guaranteed to every citizen in the constitution and international treaties, the court gave us the “Vishaka Guidelines”.

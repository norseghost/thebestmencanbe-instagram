I’ve began practicing intentional mindfulness, particularly in how I speak to myself. I don’t know about you, but I’ve had a long history of being critical towards myself. Rape only made that negative talk louder. Compounded with the shame generated from oftentimes well-meaning people who questioned my story outcome (the “why didn’t you..?”), criticized my healing journey, took advantage of my vulnerability or mistreated me when I was already at my lowest, I began to truly question my worth. ⛈⛈⛈⛈⛈⛈⛈⛈ Over the following years, I silently witnessed other survivors going through similarly what I had already experienced. The #metoo movement gave a voice to those who had suffered in silence. And as those survival stories got closer and closer to home, I knew I couldn’t stay silent any longer. At this point in my healing journey, I recognize the power in my own voice... not just in helping others to see the light, but also in ensuring that my own soul gets the nurturing that it needs. Healing is a process and starts within our own hearts and minds... and I recognize that it’s a daily battle. But I’m ready! I hope that by being transparent on my journey I can help other survivors heal. 🌸🌺🌸🌺🌸🌺 #belikethelotus #sisterhoodofsurvival #bloomwhereyouareplanted #metoo #sisterhood #healingjourney #trusttheprocess

This was me. At the height of any adversity, I would toss myself into work or school work and survive it all, but just barely. My mind was racing, I was up all night long. I just had to come up with a short term solution to a very big problem. It was always like that. *

Instead, we need to look at our problems as experiences that are meant to be lessons. They’re not there to send us into cardiac arrest. We’re meant to slow down, take a minute, breathe and mediate through it, ask ourselves what we’re meant to learn, find our way through love (first with ourselves). Do the work. It pays off in the end. You become unstoppable in the face of adversity, even if you’re ex is a toxic abuser. You will be able to handle it a lot better when you do the work.*

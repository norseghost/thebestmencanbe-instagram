For the sake of curiosity, I read the statement of Amber. She said that Johnny was torturing her for three days in Australia. But after all, everyone saw her photo in Australia. There were no signs of torture on her. This is just nonsense. She is lying. When it will stop . Her testimony is absurd. Look. The two photos below are from Johnnyâ€™s testimony.  The Photo from the top made somewhere in the same period. You can see the same traces of injuries on Johnny's face on these photos. I appeal to people, who don't believe Johnny Depp. He is not lying! He has everything to believe him. We can see that Johnny had traces of injuries. And he had it not the once. He has evidence! He has witnesses! He has video evidence! Amber has nothing. She just continue to lie. Why we didn't see traces of injuries on her face during  the 2015-2016 years? She said that Johnny was tortured her. Really? Where is evidence?! Her face looked great, her hair looked great, she looked great! She had no injuries on that period! If Johnny had done it, we would have seen it. I think she would have leave him. But no! She lived with him. The conclusion is quite understandable.  Nothing of what she says simply was not.  She is deceiving. And she's just afraid now. She knows what will happen when everyone understands that she lies to the whole world.  This is a slander. She will pay for it!

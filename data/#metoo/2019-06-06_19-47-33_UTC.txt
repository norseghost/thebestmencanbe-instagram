As a girl visiting her birth country of Iran, British actress Nazanin Boniadi got a taste of the severely restricted rights women there live with on a daily basis. That experience inspired her to get educated about women’s and human rights issues in the country, and to one day work to improve them. Later as an adult, while spending sleepless nights and days on the sets of different TV shows and films, Boniadi served as a spokesperson for Amnesty International from 2009-15, where she campaigned for the rights of disenfranchised populations across the world. Boniadi went on to land major roles in hit productions including Showtime’s “Homeland,” and the historical thriller “Hotel Mumbai” but never lost touch with her activist roots or her love for Iran, which led to her joining the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) as a board member in 2015. “Certainly, it would be much more comfortable to avoid the inevitable criticism, skepticism and backlash that comes with any Iran-related advocacy,” she told CHRI on April 15, 2019. “But for many of us expats whose loved ones suffered persecution, and who’ve been to Iran, silence is not an option.” Find Nazanin's full interview on our website.

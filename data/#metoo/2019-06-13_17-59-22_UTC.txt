Yes we are on social media all day. 
We learn about the tragedy going on in Sudan while planning marches against the atrocities occuring against doctors. 
You have no idea how much we hold back when the uncle goes on a rant about the girls of today’s generation who speak up a lot. 
We care a lot about the global warming and the lack of action taken by big corporations and governments. 
So excuse us for putting up stories and not using plastic straws because atleast gathering awareness is the least we can do while you jeapordise our future and laugh about how the climate change is not real. 
We know all about the dictatorship going on in various countries. 
We  read about racism, religious divisions all day long. 
We care about the #timesup movement. 
We care about the pilot trapped in another country. 
We care about the player made to retire without a chance. 
We care about our future or lack thereof because of the resources you depleted. 
We care about the countless animals on the verge of extinction and many who have become extinct. 
We care about the ease with which an accused can acquire a high position in court and in government. 
We care about the soldiers at the boundary line. 
Maybe that’s the point, we care too much and it hurts to see no change happening that we resort to fictional worlds in the end. 
Sincerely 
A millenial and gen z

I am an Men Empowerment Coach.  For year's l never understood men.  I mean their emotions.  Their fears.  Their insecurities. The lies they would tell to get the girl or SEX.  I will admit for year's l recented men.  With so much happening in recent years with the #metoo movement which l support.  I didn't think just walking around hating men was the solution anymore.  Today l am sharing that l am apart of the SOLUTION.  I am rolling up my sleeves and listening to the stories of ABUSE.  Neglect.  Fear.  And worthy issues that lead men down these paths.  Please join me at being part of the solution.

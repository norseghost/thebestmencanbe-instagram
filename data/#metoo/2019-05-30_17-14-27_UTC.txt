Guaranteed to make you stay focused: Womenâ€™s rights are human rights, The Republican Party isnâ€™t pro-life, itâ€™s pro-birth and anti-women, banning abortion will only ban SAFE abortion, a fetus is not a living human being, a woman should not be burdened to carry a fetus to term if she does not want to. Period. Wow, already feel more focused! ðŸ™ƒ

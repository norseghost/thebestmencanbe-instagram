66 Years Ago, (2, June 1953) theÂ coronation of Elizabeth IIÂ took place atÂ Westminster Abbey, London. ðŸ‘‘

Some Facts about the Coronation:

#QueenElizabeth IIÂ ascended the throne at the age of 25 upon the death of her father,Â George VI, on 6 February 1952, beingÂ proclaimed queenÂ by her privy and executive councils shortly afterwards.

TheÂ coronationÂ was held more than one year later because of the tradition of allowing an appropriate length of time to pass after a monarch dies before holding such festivals. It also gave the planning committees adequate time to make preparations for the ceremony.

During the service, Queen Elizabeth took an oath, was anointed with holy oil, invested with robes and regalia, and crowned Queen of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,Â South Africa,Â Pakistan, andÂ CeylonÂ - now Sri Lanka.

Prince Charles received a special hand-painted children's invitation to his mother's Coronation.

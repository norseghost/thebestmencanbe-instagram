The Last Matriarch .
‘Here’s a story my mother tells from our own matrilineal past- her brother, my maternal uncle, at the age of eight, in the early 1940’s, sat studying his English primer, rocking back and forth, muttering loudly, ‘Family means wife and children, family means wife and children’. Their grandmother, hearing him, was appalled. She raged up and down the house. ‘Is this the kind of Western nonsense they’re teaching children in school now? But family means sisters and their children... no wonder tharavadus are collapsing one by one. Bleakly, she faced a world in which brothers would abandon their families, their sisters, their nieces and nephews. A world in which a woman had nothing unless she was a wife. For her, the tharavadu was the natural institution, it was the patriarchal family that was a bizarre Western practice.’

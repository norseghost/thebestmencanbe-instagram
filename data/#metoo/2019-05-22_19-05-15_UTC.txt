An inspiring evening last night at the #PENGala. I had two important takeaways. First, Bob Woodward talked about how all of us who cover DC politics know that, privately, Republicans tell us they are extremely anxious about Trump—just as anxious as the Dems. Our job is to get them to go ON THE RECORD. Secondly, Anita Hill said that it’s imperative in the era of #MeToo that we as women protect and honor free speech by speaking up and speaking honestly. It is our duty to speak the truth.

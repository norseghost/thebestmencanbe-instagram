One of the most common fight that our generation is fighting today is anxiety and depression. I myself am an anxiety fighter.This was the hardest battle of my life .i know how it feels to fight something that is inside your head ,it is like fighting yourself .but the only thing that kept me going was knowing that this time will pass and i will become stronger than i have ever been. It is so, so exhausting and pathetic, everyday u have to get up and fight your battle. u cannot even share how u feel cause u r scared that people will judge and leave or they will laugh at u . Being continously scared of anything just anything and that results in an attack. Even being scared for having an attack. Whenever i used to gather some courage qnd go out to some gatherings i continously had the fear of having an attack in the public but i knew i was not alone and neither are you. I used to share my fear with my friend i know it doesnt help much but it gave me some relief at least just  2% .so pls go and share ... you are not going to die ...this will get over.. everything will pass and you will shine brighter my dear u r loved. ‚ù§

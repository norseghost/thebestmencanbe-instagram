                        "text": "Starting my shoot with a super cool all female crew today working on a film about sexual harassment in the workplace. As soon as I read the script I could tell it was a female led project due to its honesty and insight for women in the workplace. A great script that sets up a number of seemingly innocent compliments, conversations and moments of physical contact that many women (and men) experience at work. Unfortunately many of us feel we cannot speak out about some of these behaviours because no one has actually \u201ccrossed a line\u201d yet. Can you tell someone to stop hitting on you if they haven\u2019t actually asked you out? Can you tell someone not to touch you if they haven\u2019t touched you somewhere inappropriate? Can you tell someone not to compliment you when they\u2019re just \u2018being nice\u2019? The reality is you can. Harassment isn\u2019t about intentions, it\u2019s about outcomes. If someone makes you feel uncomfortable then it shouldn\u2019t matter if they meant it as a compliment or a joke or were just being friendly, your feelings are valid. \nThe rules are simple. If you are doing or saying something you think is nice but the person on the receiving end is not responding with genuine enthusiasm then stop doing it. If you\u2019re unsure whether something is appropriate for workplace talk, touch or \u201cbanter\u201d don\u2019t take the risk. If you see something happening to someone else, step in and stand up for them. And if you feel uncomfortable don\u2019t be too embarrassed to say so or to ask a colleague or friend for support. Nobody is a \u2018snowflake\u2019 for not enjoying inappropriate remarks and nobody deserves to feel uncomfortable or on display at work. Let\u2019s unblur the lines. \nAnd on a sweeter note here is another photo from my photo shoot with the absolutely lovely @retrofotostudio\n.\n.\n.\n#feminism #harrassment #mybodymyrules #metoo #femaleempowerment #strongwomen #bekind #loveyourself #loveeachother #igpodium_portraits #kdpeoplegallery #quietthechaos #portraitphotography #portraiture #banter #lingerieshoot #actor #actress #bts #actorslife #setlife #drama #lovemyjob #actout #standup #auburnhair #redhead #girlsonfilm #girlpower"

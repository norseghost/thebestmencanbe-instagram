"Good is towing the line, being behaved, being quiet, being passive, fitting in, being liked. But great is being messy, having a belly, speaking your mind, standing up for what you believe in, fighting for another paradigm, not letting people talk you out of what you know to be true." -Eve Ensler

I wrote down this quote in my journal last week, and it's been both convicting and inspiring in light of the aftermath of the abortion ban that passed in 9 states, and my own silence. I’m noticing how often I don't speak my mind and defend what I believe to be true. How often I bury my head in the sand because I don’t want to face the repercussions of adding my voice to the collective conversation. But right now I need to stop being “good”—I need to not be silent. Because my discomfort on speaking up is not really important in light of the very REAL violence that’s happening right now against women—poor women, women of color, immigrant women, violated women, trans and gender-non-conforming folx, anyone with a body that can get pregnant. Everyone deserves good health care and access to safe abortions. Full stop.✨

You see, my silence is actually a coping skill, but it’s unhelpful. Underneath it all, I’m raging. And feeling scared and out of control, silenced again by the men in power in this country. And I’m also noticing my guilt about my privilege—my white skin, my non-immigrant status, my fierce tribe of feminist healers and artists and social justice advocates who support me like family. And this is me releasing all those feelings and not keeping it inside. 💫

I can't stay silent. I don’t want to ever go back to being “good” and quiet. The abortion ban is a tool of white supremacy. It’s violent, and it’s wrong.

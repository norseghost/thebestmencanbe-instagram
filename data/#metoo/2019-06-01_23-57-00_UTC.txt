MEN WE NEED YOU!

These past almost two years hash helped all this collective trauma healing, this #metoo movement really shook thing up and reshuffled the cards.  Men showed up  during this time. Holding space, allowing this conversation, listening even though it has been uncomfortable. Thank you men!

It is time to return the favor dear sweet women. What do you think? Are you ready to hold space for the men in your life? (The masculine in you)

THIS IS NOT ABOUT HEALING THE MASCULINE AS A PERPETRATOR. THIS IS ABOUT HEALING THE MASCULINE AS AN INNOCENT CHILD WHOSE MOTIVES WERE PURE AND SOMEONE TRIED TO CONFINE HIS EXPRESSIONS.

Dear women and dear men, how can we support and nurture the masculine? What would be the most nurturing feelings for you to receive so you feel our support? What will make you thrive? How can we be in partnership, in service, and honor your growth? What did the boy child need and not get?

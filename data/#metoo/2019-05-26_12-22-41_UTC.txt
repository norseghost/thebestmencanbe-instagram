This really hits home for me. Communication with your children is so important anyway but there can be dire consequences for not listening to your children or for your children not feeling comfortable enough to open up to you when it really matters.

Listen without judgment, as hard as that may be. Agree to disagree. Make sure your children are comfortable talking to you about ANYTHING, no matter how taboo, uncomfortable or unpopular it may be. And let your kids be who they are. They'll thank you for it later.

Also, ask your children things. Show interest. Show your concern. Someone said they were tired of seeing movies with millennials without families. My response was: but that narrative is true... The root of it is in this photo. A generation told to "Shuttup and sit down" their entire childhood. But we all see who needs to be muted.

THE MISOGYNY TRIALS are back!

This funny, tragic, thoughtful play is back following a sold-out performance in February and rave reviews (here is just a snapshot): ‚Ä¢ Fabulous & Funny. Made my cheeks hurt.
‚Ä¢ Really thought provoking
‚Ä¢ Witty, good hearted & very perceptive
‚Ä¢ Very funny/relevant

It is the year 2030. Misogyny has been outlawed since 2020, yet this undesirable practice still lurks in the dark corners of modern-day society.

The amazing performance by Womanly Words Productions and 12 talented regional artists, represents a snapshot of cases brought before Judge Hope, a commanding woman who has made it her mission to stamp out misogyny in all its guises. 
Directed by Shirley Lloyd

My heart is to help people that have illnesses that aren’t visible. I used to work with the most amazing beautiful woman that had fibromyalgia and some other health issues that you couldn’t see.  I saw over and over again how she was discriminated because of this! When people can see a bandage or a wheelchair they are usually more compassionate.  We need to try to be compassionate to everyone that we encounter, because you never know what someone is battling that’s not visible! Have a great week everyone!

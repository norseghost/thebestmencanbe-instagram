Know you are safe, know you are loved, & I promise this is not how it ends.

You will find your voice, you will be heard, & there are many who will help you heal.

The weight you carry I know has been overwhelming, but you will not always carry it alone. -
-
& those that chose to strip you bare, will no longer hold any keys to your happiness.

The broken pieces of your life will call for something bigger, & what awaits will bring love like you never dreamed. -
-
And things will be more than ok.

Your heart, your body, your soul will mend, and will fall a river of tears as you find your way home again.

One day all that you are yearning for, the love & magic you deserve, will effortlessly radiate throughout your life. & in your full magnificence, know the beauty inside of you that I can now so clearly see. -

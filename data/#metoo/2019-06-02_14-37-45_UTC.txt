There is no safety in the depth of love. We cannot strategize our way out of risk. To love deeply is to be vulnerable to loss. It is painful to love deeply and then lose what you love. But not as painful as never really getting to love. 
Loving from the sidelines is more comfortable. We don't have to care as much when love leaves. We can buffer our pain with blame, anger and criticism. It's safer to keep people at a distance. 
But what we risk is never getting annihilated by love. Never risking destruction is never finding how many times and ways you can be rebuilt. How much of you can fall away before you find the part of you that never is destroyed.

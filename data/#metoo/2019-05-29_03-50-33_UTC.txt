The only way abortion will ever truly almost come to an end is when we begin to teach comprehensive sex education, give teens free IUDs without parental consent, etc. Nothing will ever come out of banning abortion, birth control, and making the masses ignorant. This is about control. Make it about the prevention of abortions. ~ðŸ¥‘ (credit to the person tagged)

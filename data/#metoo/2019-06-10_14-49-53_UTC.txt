In January, our DWP Founder @crystaredwine had the privilege of being interviewed by @charlaturner4good , co-pastor of Turning Point Church. She was given the opportunity to share her personal testimony, how that birthed Defined With Purpose, and how we get to do what we do each day.

DWP consists of 3 different workshops that cater to the various needs of our clients: Want To Be Me, Made For More and No More Secrets.

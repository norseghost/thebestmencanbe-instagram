This man right here @genusarbetaren . A Swedish man who used to work in the building industry as a carpenter but decided to quit his dayjob and started full-time studies in gender science. He writes about the male-dominated industry,the "macho culture" and the language that is used within the workfield and how harmful it is for not only women (of course) but also how it harms men. He discusses the norms of being a man,how to react when guys in group acts in a sexist way and I truly wish more men follow his lead! #inspiration #feminism #patriarchy #sexistic #equality #maleperspective #Sweden #varärallamän #metoo

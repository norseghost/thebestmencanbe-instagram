In February 2019 I have visited 1.Jewish women empowerment summit in Germany.
Dozens of young, talanted ladies & amazing speakers.

Short report 👩‍💻

* Anyway you won't be loved by everyone, so don't care💩
⠀
➡️ Jewish+women= double discrimination ✡️
⠀
𝗕𝗨𝗧 you can stay against it => people don't like what they don't understand - make a dialogue be gorgeous and inspiring like @toryburch or @susanwojcicki
⠀
➡️ Women are not week & never were
⠀
Art transition 🎨- check out bloody story of Yael/Jael/יָעֵל
Women in conflict today - victim/supporter/survivor ?!
⠀
➡️S̶̶̶̶e̶̶̶̶x̶̶̶̶ is not a tabu topic
[But it is still hard to talk about it for many girls]
⠀
➡️ Relationship status: complicated
[Many girls are between 2 poles - family OR career 😥 => true feminism means comprises & support !!! ]
[My ambitions or my ❤️: natural sciences (no girls in labs) 👩‍🔬, politics, doctors... ]
⠀
➡️We are not a silent 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆!

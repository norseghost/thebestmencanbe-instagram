With a plethora of new brands and startup coming up full-fledged in recent time, what should keep a consumer stick to a particular brand? What would ensure brand loyalty?
1.Focus on branding done right with a back story enabling customers to form a connection with the brand.
2.Focus on quality of brand experiences across the value chain. From your employees to customer services and your products.
3.Develop quality content around your brand focusing on elements of Storytelling. Digital and physical touchpoints now must work together flawlessly – yet also do what each touchpoint does best on its own.
4.Engage with your consumers across all media. Be human and authentic!

In other words, get the fuck out of your head. Listen to the deep wisdom being transmitted to us through our feelings, our guts, our physicality.

It's not what our head tells us about our body but what our body and it's divine sensitivity tells us about our lives that brings us peace and wisdom. Respect it's limitations, marvel at it's capacity for feeling, honor it's ability to heal in the way that serves our highest good. 
It's not a servent to be bullied into submission. It needs no improvement other than learning how to care for it tenderly.

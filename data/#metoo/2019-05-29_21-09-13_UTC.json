The signs can vary child to child and aren't always easy to see, but if you educate yourself on the warning signs you might be able to spot them more easily. .\n.\n.\nYoung Children Warning Signs \ud83d\udc47\n1. Some children start wetting the bed even though they've outgrown that. \n2. Child is suddenly afraid to be alone or left with a certain individual.\n3. Doesn't want to remove clothes to change or doesn't want to bathe. \n4. Sexual behavior that is inappropriate for the age of the child. \n5. Nightmares or fear of being alone at night. .\n.\n.\nTeenager Warning Signs \ud83d\udc47\n1. Unusual weight loss or weight gain. \n2. Excessive eating or loss of appetite. \n3. Signs of depression, such as lack of energy, loss of appetite, persistent sadness, withdrawn from normal activities. \n4. Anxiety or worry. \n5. Falling grades. \n6. Changes in self-care, such as paying less attention to hygiene or personal appearance.\n7. Drug or alcohol abuse. \n8. Reclusive and withdrawn from friends. .\n.\n.\nMost of these warning signs can be found on www.rainn.org\n.\n.\nI personally experienced a lot of these signs. By educating ourselves as adults we could possibly recognize a child who needs help, stop the abuse, and get that child the help they need! \ud83d\udc9b\n.\n.\n#childabuseprevention #childabuse #childadvocate #sexualviolence #sexualassaultadvocate #sexualabuse #rapesurvivor #resilience #mentalhealthadvocate #mentalillness #anxiety #anxietyawareness #ptsdawareness #ptsd #depression #supportsurvivors #believesurvivors #metoo #timeforchange #traumasurvivor #timesup #atx #detroit #milwaukee #seattle #nyc #miami"

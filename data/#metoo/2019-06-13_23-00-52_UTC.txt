When I won the 2019 SBAA International Women's Day Leadership Award, this was part of my speech…

And, to all women...Dare to dream bigger than ever before. Dare to forge your own path no matter how hard the challenges... But most of all, dare to be you and let the chips fall where they may. We are all warrior women with gossamer wings…It’s time to roar!

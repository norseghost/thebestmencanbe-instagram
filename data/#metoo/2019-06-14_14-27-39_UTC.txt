Birth of Venus vibes in the @deveauxnewyork Resort 2020 lookbook 🐚💙 @nicolephelps writes for @voguerunway, “[Creative Director] @tommyton’s street style photos and those of others like him have played their part in fashion’s awakening, alongside the rise of Instagram, the presence of female designers in top jobs, and the consciousness raising of #MeToo and Time’s Up. He has an eye for ‘real women’ with real style, not influencers in head-to-toe runway looks, and his taste runs to the minimal, though it’s not strict. Phoebe Philo’s Céline is a touchstone.” Photos by @junebugkim

What a day!! Thank you @tedx_glasgow so grateful for this opportunity to share my story further and wider. I was so nervous waiting to go on stage but once I stood on that red dot I knew it wasnâ€™t about me talking but who was listening. Speaking out for all those who canâ€™t find their voice yet âœŠðŸ’› #tedxgla2019 #ted #tedtalks #MADTalks #Unbroken #nomoreshame #metoo #speakingout #findyourvoice #endthesilence

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi still prefers to see Trump defeated at the ballot box and then prosecuted for his alleged crimes, instead of being impeached, sources tell us. Pelosi clashed with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler in a meeting Tuesday night over whether to launch impeachment proceedings. Nadler pressed Pelosi to allow his committee to launch an impeachment inquiry against Trump ‚Äî the second time he‚Äôs asked in recent weeks. But he was once again shot down by Pelosi and other senior leaders. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,‚Äù Pelosi said, according to multiple Democratic sources.

You’ve seen our super photogenic cast wearing them, but did you know our fabulous Masher t-shirts are for sale? As if you needed further motivation to see the show (our pay-what-you-can June 9 show still has plenty of seats available!), these tees will be available for purchase at the door for $20. See the show and do some shopping while you’re at it. Sounds like a solid evening to us! #MashThis #Winesexual #PressTheButton #HFF19

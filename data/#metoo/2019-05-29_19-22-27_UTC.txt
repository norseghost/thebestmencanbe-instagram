Vulnerability is so incredibly important and itâ€™s where true strength lies. Itâ€™s where youâ€™re your most authentic and powerful self. No masks to be worn, no additional roles to play. 
Vulnerability sometimes means opening up to some type of emotional pain/fear.

My question to you is: Donâ€™t you get tired of building walls of steel around your heart?

Choose to grow and connect with your inner being. Choose to be raw even when you run into people who donâ€™t how to handle this beautiful energy of yours. Choose to show parts of yourself youâ€™re not most comfortable with. Because you see, those parts too are beautiful.

Yes, itâ€™s fucking scary, but choosing to embrace the possibilities of what vulnerability brings, will be worth it.

The deepest passion
The most liberating type of love
and most of all,
the REALIST connections of all time ðŸ’«

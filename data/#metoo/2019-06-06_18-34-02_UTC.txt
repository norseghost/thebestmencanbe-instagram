#Her30DaysofGratitude | Day 6

"I'm grateful for *purpose*. This first part of the year has taught me there's nothing better than discovering yourself and knowing what you were created to do. It's an exhilarating process.

I'm grateful for this because now, I'm building my capacity to impact my world in incredible ways.

I'm so excited seeing what I've been able to accomplish in the first half. My heart is ready to receive what the rest of the year holds!" - @atiku.nafisa

Being targeted does not define you it is not part of your story or your identity. The moment you decide it does it can wave a red flag for the next bully.  When you decide itâ€™s part of you it integrates into your belief system and cascades into your behaviours and body language. This is what we call mind body emotion experience. Reframe it. Your targeted because you have what that insecure Pigeon doesnâ€™t have ðŸ˜Š (if your wondering about Pigeon read my previous post from this week) and so you become a threat. 
Love your difference.

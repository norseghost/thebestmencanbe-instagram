                        "text": "What you keep to yourself can create a long term kind of excruciating emotional agony that the body will eventually bear. I did this to myself. But I didn\u2019t know there was a connection between the abuses I went through as a child and the illnesses I developed in my twenties. Back then, science wasn\u2019t backing this up. I thought my illnesses were just physical. They weren\u2019t. Even after I changed my diet, I was still sick. I was loads better but still searching for something to stop the nausea and abdominal pain that led to IBS, ulcers, migraines, depression, and severe leaky gut syndrome. .\n.\n.\nToday we know through the ACE Study (Adverse Childhood Experiences) that there is an irrefutable link between sexual, physical, and emotional, abuse and family dysfunction as a child. Certain diseases are more prevalent including cancer, fibromyalgia, diabetes, heart and lung diseases. If you want to take the ACE Quiz to assess your risk and better understand the relationships in your own life, go to this link: www.meghaworth.com You can also sign up to speak with me for free there or through the link in my bio. .\n.\n.\nThe best news is that through the magic of Transpersonal Psychology and Whole Person Integration Technique, you can heal your body. It\u2019s a holistic mind-body medicine process that gets to the root of the problem and helps you transform it at the cellular level. .\n.\n.\nBegin by telling your story to someone. Just get it out and move forward. If you\u2019ve been in therapy for a while and you\u2019re tired of telling your story, you don\u2019t really have to with the work that I do. It\u2019s a whole different approach that frees you holistically. It saved me time and time again from fibromyalgia and brain injuries from a lightning strike. Look into it. You\u2019ve got nothing to lose and you could gain your health back. Your body remembers what you are trying to forget. You can release this pain. .\n.\n.\n#ace #abusesurvivor #metoo #metoomovement #healyourpain #holistichealing #wellnesscoach #getwellnow #thelightningwomen #drmeghaworth #shareyourstory #chronicillness #cancer #fibromyalgia #ibs #diabetes #emotionalhealing #wholeperson #integration"

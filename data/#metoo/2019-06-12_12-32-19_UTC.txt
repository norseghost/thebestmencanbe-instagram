Canada’s response to the Myanmar genocide: When asked if he would revoke the Myanmar leader’s honorary citizenship, Justin Trudeau said "Let's be very clear: The hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of people affected by this Rohingya crisis, by this genocide, whether or not Aung San Suu Kyi has Canadian citizenship or not, honorary or not, makes no difference in solving this crisis. Canada is entirely focused on solutions that will move forward to protect these citizens, these individuals, to support them, to put an end to this ongoing humanitarian crisis,"

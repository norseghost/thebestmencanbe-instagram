Haven't used protein powder in years, but it's time to summer bulk, bro! You can custom build your protein powder from #truenutrition adding greens, additional bcaa's, just about anything you can think of and it's cheap as shit! They also offer whey options if that's your thing. Currently hovering around 210-212 lb, depending on hydration levels. Hoping to be a lean-ish 220 lb by the fall.

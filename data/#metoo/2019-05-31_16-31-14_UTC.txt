I support the survivors of sexual violence in war and conflict ðŸ’›

This may not be my most artistic photo ever but it is an important one. Today I was wandering Oslo and stumbled across the @thenobelpeacecenter in Oslo. Wandering around, it highlighted worldly issues and real life superheroes. But the exhibition which really got me was the one about sexual violence as a weapon in war. It was upsetting and heartbreaking to see how vile humans can be and how much damage individuals can inflict not just one one person (including men and children), but families and communities. But what really moved me was the strength of people like @nadia_murad_taha who are not giving up and are fighting to end sexual violence as a weapon in war. While the world does need more heroines like this, it also struck me that the world shouldnâ€™t need heroes and heroines like this- humans should just be able to be decent.

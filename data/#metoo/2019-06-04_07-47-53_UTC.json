                        "text": "Accessibility & the importance of trauma informed care! CW: Trauma\u26a0\ufe0f \u2022\nI have C-PTSD & a history of medical & personal trauma. I have been in therapy for years, worked with leading trauma specialists, psychiatrists, & researchers, & participated in dozens of treatments & experimental studies.\n\nTrauma plays a powerful role in healthcare. It can prevent your body from responding to treatment, damage connective pathways between your brain & body, & decimate your autoimmune system. For people like me, lack of trauma informed care is a HUGE accessibility issue that severely limits our access to competent & compassionate healthcare.\n\nFinding trauma informed care is a constant struggle. I\u2019ve had doctors mock requests for female providers, tell me that my trauma makes me \u201ctoo picky,\u201d lie, ignore safety protocols, & even participate in sexual harassment.\n\nWhile I can\u2019t always see female providers I go out of my way to find them, especially if I need invasive examinations or procedures. Today I had to go to an ENT appointment with a male doctor I\u2019d never met so he could put a scope up my nose & down my throat to check my airways for non-existent problems. The entire appointment was traumatizing & unnecessary. The ENT knew it, I knew it, the nurses knew it. We were there because my allergist wanted proof that I was experiencing true anaphylaxis & not vocal chord issues. We dutifully played our parts, the procedure went smoothly & unsurprisingly everything was healthy.\n\nFor my doctor the appointment was an inconvenience, but for me it was a living nightmare. It meant weeks of anticipatory disassociation, flash backs, panic attacks, night terrors, insomnia, & increased internal bleeding because of stress & lack of medications. Even though nothing happened, Elliott was there, Atlas was a superstar, & it took 30mins, I will be dealing with the effects for weeks. In my trauma brain it wasn\u2019t an appointment, it was a reenactment of every traumatic moment of my life.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t talk about it enough, trauma informed care is a serious access issue. Patients should have the right to feel safe with their providers & have their emotional safety protected. #realaccessibility"

I’ve started a new section on my blog called Faces of Fibromyalgia. I have posted my photo.  Please could my fellow FM warriors email their story and a photo of themselves to me on fibroramblings@gmail.com. These stories will help raise awareness, educate & help fellow sufferers. I thank you in advance🙏 #fibromyalgia #fibromyalgiaawareness #chronicpain #fibrowarriors #metoo #fibrostories

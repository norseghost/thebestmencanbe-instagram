I've attended as many HerNetwork events as I was available to attend. They recharge and energize me, they make me learn, aim higher and stay on track.

Some of the most amazing people I know today, I met at @hernetworkonline and I osm speak about how proud I am to be a part of that community.

You can only imagine my excitement!
Head over and grab a seat for yourself, I'll be sharing, learning and hugging all the way... let's go🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️ Reposted from @hernetworkonline -  #RealWomenRealNetwork | Join us for @Chatsandcocktails Unfiltered; Meet Ella aka "The Bridge Builder" George (@peachkween). Ella is the principal consultant at @hillbridgeconsulting and she will be joining us for #Chatsandcocktails Unfiltered!

During our #RealTalkSession, Ella will be sharing about the Importance of Structure in Business! She believes it's about time more businesses start surviving beyond 1 or 2 Generations and we agree!

We are so excited about our UNFILTERED themed mixer holding in June in Ikoyi, Lagos! The second half of the year has no other choice but to be fruitful and we're being very intentional about the steps we're taking to see it to fruition!

Thank you Ella for being a part of this!

Milo has alimentary lymphoma (bowel cancer) and is currently undergoing chemotherapy after having surgery to remove a large mass from his abdomen. Heâ€™s doing well and is starting to gain weight-heâ€™s even back in the garden chasing birds!! ðŸ™€ Our chemo patients are very special and get loads of extra love and cuddles as they spend a lot of time in hospital. Keep up the good work Milo!! ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’•ðŸ˜º#milo #feline #chemotherapy #patient #loves #cheezels #metoo #blackcat #toocoolforschool #vetlove #catsofsydney #veterinary #oncology #lymphoma  #catlyfe #tuxedo #catsofinstagram #catsofsydney #whitepaws #cute #pawsome #vetlove #vetlife #vetsofsdney #catlife #pets #vetlove #easternsuburbs #kingsfordvet #kingsford

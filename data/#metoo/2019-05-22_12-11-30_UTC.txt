Who doesn't love a feminist adaptation/analysis of a Hollywood classic? Exploring the power of manipulation, fake news and gaslighting, #Vanishing by @sarahsigal, @beccacd and @fluffproductions deconstructs Hitchcock’s The Lady Vanishes and brings it into the 21st century to find out what happens when women’s stories aren’t believed. Coming to CPT on May 28 as part of Calm Down Dear! - Booking link in bio - #CDD19 #hitchcock #feministfilm #feministheatre #londontheatre #londonfringe #metoo #timesup

Feminist cultural critic Mithu Sanyal’s four-letter-word of a book “Rape: From Lucretia to #MeToo” holds that rape, like beauty, is in the eye of its beholders. Sanyal catalogues an impressive range of rape-related phenomena, from Rembrandt’s oil portrait of Lucretia preparing to commit suicide to Julian Assange’s seven-year stay inside Ecuador’s embassy in London. All the while, she never abandons her concern for “what we talk about when we talk about rape.” Words, as well as grammar, remain her principal concern. Myriam Gurba reviews. (Link in our bio)

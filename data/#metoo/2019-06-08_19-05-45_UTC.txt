Encouragement from my children after I broke the silence and shared my story of sexual abuse with the world. They shared my story with there friends and they were all so proud and thought it was very courageous of me. My husband and children have stood by my side and supported me every step of the way in my journey of healing. I love them all so much ‚ù§

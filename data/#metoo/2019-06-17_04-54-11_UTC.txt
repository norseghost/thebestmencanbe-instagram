A Betrayal Trauma Perspectiveon Domestic Violence by: Melissa Platt, Jocelyn Bartonand Jennifer J. Freyd. "Another important reason why victims are prone to denial and minimization is that domestic violence is one of the most devastating formsof betrayal a person can experience. Precisely because persons depend
on intimate relationships to be safe and cared for, they are most vulnerable in these settings. When violence occurs within intimate rela-
tionships, victims may find their basic needs for solace, refuge,protection, and respect cannot be met. Furthermore, this intimate violence may undermine the victimsâ€™ world view, and with it, their moorings in reality. Acts of violence by intimate partners throw intoquestion what can truly be trusted."

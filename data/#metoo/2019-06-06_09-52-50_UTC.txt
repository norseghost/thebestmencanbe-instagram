First Summer Read:
Lima::Limón by Natalie Scenters-Zapico
@nascenters 
Dear Natalie (a love letter), When I read these lines from the poem “Neomachismo” I saw myself in the space between the words✨
✨
“Wear a red dress & let men pull at it all night. Your desire: to have your/ hair pulled, to bleed, to lick your wounds like a dog in heat.//Say you’re sorry for getting angry. Say you’re sorry for being angry. Say/ you’re sorry that you’re angry.//Anger is the emotion of men” ✨
✨
I’ve been that dog so many times even though I believed my self-love and self-confidence were enough. Over the past 8 months I realized they are not. ✨ I’ve been on this journey: to build boundaries, to not let brown men come back, to not go back to them. To not be so forgiving. And I have asked myself if it is really forgiveness that I am offering?

When you wrote “…he asks: Who taught you to hate/ yourself?” I wondered if this could be true for me. I’m still learning how to love myself enough to not repeat patterns. To love myself enough to stop allowing these men from diminishing my worth. To love myself enough to not give and give and give, until there is nothing left for ME. ✨

I randomly reached for your book before leaving on a self care trip. For the past 6 months I’ve allowed a man to diminish my worth.  I know the universe put your book in my hands this week. Thank you for your words.✨ I’ve decided to teach your book in my intro creative writing class this fall because your words make real what silence has made invisible. Each poem is so beautifully threaded together with reoccurring ideas/images/metaphors and I really want to show my students how poems can tell a story.
✨
You have truly honored las mujeres de Juárez.
✨ 
With all my love, 
from one poeta to another✨

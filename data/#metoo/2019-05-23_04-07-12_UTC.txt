The many phases this painting went through. It ended up having beautiful subtle detailing and some actual embroidery details (which I will most likely not do again, so time consuming, but worth it in this case). Finn is so tiny in this old photo, such a little babe! The whole series had been released, to view, visit link in profile. ❤️ 56x64” oil and mixed media on canvas.

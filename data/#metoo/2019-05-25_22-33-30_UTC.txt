The shoulda, coulda, woulda, stuff is dead... it’s time to fight and time to be heard. You’ll never make a change sitting on your ass. The power is within each and every one of you, wether you believe it or not. Everyone who’s made a difference in history has been proactive! Be the change, be the solution, be the voice! Much love to those who participated in this event and even more love to those who helped set this up. .

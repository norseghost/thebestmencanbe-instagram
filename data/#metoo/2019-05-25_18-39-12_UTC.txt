"You cannot live to please everyone else. You have to edify, educate and fulfill your own dreams and destiny, and hope that whatever your art is that you're putting out there, if it's received, great, I respect you for receiving it. If it's not received, great, I respect you for not." - #OctaviaSpencer (Born this day, May 25, 1972) // Swipe to see a shoutout from #SisterGirl #ViolaDavis üòç

Abuse is all about power and control of one person over another. Abusers use their power to control victims and keep them from speaking out. Abusers get power in many different ways. Power comes from all sorts of places — everything from a person’s physical stature and strength, to their job, to whether or not it’s their name on the bank accounts. And those are just a few examples.

Abusers find ways to control the perception of reality within abusive situations. And that allows them to exert control over a victim.

There are many things we should stand up for. Its been obvious to me that last few weeks some folks fight some battles with others. But what about the fight for your own soul, correction is awesome if it is directed to assist someone at being a better person. Watch your actions as they may not reflect what you attempt to illuminate. It is about being genuine and I understand we are all different but remember each person is gracefully broken. #gracefullybroken #MaskOff #Processofthesoul #CoachConsult #Metoo #Survivor #selfreflection

No more codependency, no more dreams that wonâ€™t come true. Just the steady daily work and the confident belief that I can and I will build the life I was born to live. I proudly carry my past: all of my successes, failures, traumas, and recoveries, all of my joys and heartaches, into my future. There is no internal resistance now and any external challenge I will face with bravery and conviction. This is how I will carry myself from this day forward.

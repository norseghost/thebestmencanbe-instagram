Tales of a Tough Girl:
He was mild, yet mesmerizing;
And it was so fortunate we happened upon one another when we did, but it came with a certain chaos as well. 
I often missed him during those golden days when we were apart, but now I feel the relief.
Relieved that he has gone;
Relieved that he has vanished without a trace;
Relieved that I am no longer intoxicated by his lies and deception.
And although it hurt letting him go...
Letting it go....
It was a testament to the strength in which I possessed....
For I must be the toughest girl around to have resisted his devilish charm....
For he put a spell on every woman he ever set eyes on and made a wreck of her in the process.
But I was not one to be messed with...so with a smile...I waved goodbye.

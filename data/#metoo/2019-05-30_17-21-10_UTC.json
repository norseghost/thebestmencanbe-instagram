                        "text": "[CW, TW; sexual assault, rape, partner violence]\n\u2022\nSex educators, therapist, social workers, and just about everyone else have so much to learn from kink practitioners and kink/BDSM studies of communication, healing, social and mental adjustment, and consent-based practices.\n\u2022\nAs a younger undergrad student, I became involved with the Center for Positive Sexuality (@ctrsexpositive). I learned incredible frameworks from their research and workshops, that have informed my approach to and understanding of positive sexuality. I have so much respect for kink practitioners and kink and they should be respected as healers and as spaces of healing.\n\u2022\nI\u2019ve mentioned in posts before, I was in an abusive relationship, and this was not long after I was reeling from the traumatic experience of being raped after just turning 18, mind you this was years before the swell of momentum behind the #MeToo movement. I was blamed, attacked, shamed, by many after what happened, and navigating that for me, at the time, meant hyper-sexuality under the guise of \u201csexual liberation\u201d.\n\u2022\nI would do anything, be \u201cdown for anything\u201d, so that, in my mind, no one could force anything sexual onto me. I sexualized myself, tried to emulate the incredibly toxic and misogynistic \u201ccool girl\u201d (before i came out as nonbinary and ever felt that was possible for me) and at the attention was so validating, even thought it often led to situations that let me with a twisted, uncomfortable feeling in my gut.\n\u2022\nEarly in this abusive relationship, my partner would be pressure me into watching abusive scenario porn and clips, humiliation videos, movies with sexual violence (for example, Requim for a Dream, you know the scenes) and he would watch them with glee and sadistic pleasure. I sat there, my head starting to spin, feeling nauseous and fighting flashbacks, but I was already invested and desperate for validation, so I pushed against these feelings and attached myself to this very sick person, whose validation often came at a price. I told myself I was in control, that it was part of being sexually liberated. [Continued in comments]"

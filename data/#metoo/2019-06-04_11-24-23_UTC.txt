How long i have come through!!!!! .
.
.
Listening to never ending taunts. Getting depressed about my looks about my weight. Questioning Allah for making me imperfect . .
.
.
Here i am today looking at 18 years old me wishing I could have tell her that everything is going to be ok❤️

Loosing hope, getting mentally sick just because I didn’t have that perfect complexion, I didn’t have those silky straight hair with cute bangs , couldn’t fit into the ideal waist jeans neither could i wear short tops because of having heavy thighs. .
.
.
.
Getting rejected by fellows because I couldn’t afford to follow the trend that time ... focusing on studies more than on my looks was my priority that has paid off and here i am today sitting & scrolling down my folders watching old me and smiling because i am at the place where i once dreamt for. .

I am not ashamed of sharing my journey are you?

.
.
.
I love being imperfect .

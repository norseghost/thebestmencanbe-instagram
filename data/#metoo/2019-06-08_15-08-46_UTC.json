                        "text": "Raising a child while being in the adult industry is a challenge.  I\u2019ll admit it.  There was no \u201cbring your child to work day\u201d or \u201cbring your parent to school for career day\u201d. And I was kind of bummed to have missed those things.  Or not be able to fully disclose my profession to him for fear that he wouldn\u2019t understand or reject it.  He\u2019s a smart kid.  He started asking questions when he was 8 yrs old. \u201cWhere is your office\u201d \u201c what do you do there\u201d \u201ccan I come to work with you\u201d \u201cwhy do you work so late\u201d and all those things.  When I was in the prime of performing, he\u2019d wake up when I came home, usually dressed in latex catsuits and he was curious. He thought I looked like a super hero.  So when he started asking the questions, I started answering them.  Subtly and in terms I hoped he\u2019d understand.  I said I made movies where I was mean to people while I was dressed in the outfits he had seen me in.  His response \u201cmean...like Chucky?\u201d That was good for a chuckle.  No. I don\u2019t kill people.  I just raise my voice and punish them.  And make them behave better.  And that it was all just for pretend.  His knowledge was a slow build up from there.  But each time he asked a question, I told him truths.  Never lied. Ever.  Over time, he and his friends started seeing me on TV.  A 1000 ways to die was popular among them at that time.  So was the pistachio commercial.  When his friends would comment or make weird remarks, his response was \u201cyeah, it\u2019s weird.  It\u2019s what she was doing before I was born, it\u2019s what\u2019s she does now.  And apparently she\u2019s the most famous one so it\u2019s seems like she\u2019s good at her job\u201d. As he\u2019d shrug his shoulders, and redirect the conversation to \u201cso what does your mom or dad do?\u201d I taught him that everyone has a path to walk.  Guided by their own moral compass and it was important for him to walk his own path. With confidence and without apology. \u201cWhat ever you do, do it for you, be the best at it, work hard at it and enjoy it.\u201d Like I have.  Now that he\u2019s 18 and an adult, he gave permission to finally be seen in my world. He even asked if I needed summer help at the store before college starts. So you may see him around. His name is Nova.\u2b50\ufe0f"

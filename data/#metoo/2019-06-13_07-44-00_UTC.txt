While I am more of a fixed wing guy, I did have some crazy fun on helos in Belarus and Ukraine. On this MI-2 ride, we are buzzing right next to the treetops with the airspeed showing 150km/h and the radio altimeter 25 metres. (Soviet aviation is metric...) This roller coaster ride also included some aerobatic manouvres and a nice range of negative and positive G:s.

Read about this Beautiful young lady with a Hidden Difference and her daily struggles. 
My name is Emily Johnstone, I’m 25 and after falling ill with an inflammatory bowel disease called ulcerative colitis, I had two major surgeries in 2018 that left me with no colon and a permanent stoma. Life has been difficult over the past year, I’ve had to completely learn to love my body all over again and be positive about the changes good and bad! People can be mean, I get stares in public and I’m always told I don’t look disabled. Especially if I’m using a disabled toilet. 
I’m all about body positivity and pushing the boundaries with having a stoma. This new body isn’t going to stop me doing what I’ve always wanted to do! @emilysileostomy #ostomate #stoma #bodypositive #bodyequality #metoo #showus #survivor ❤️

My life feels like chaos right now but I also feel like a rock in a storm, I know things work out for the best and I know change is synonymous with life and I know growth comes hand in hand with a bit of growing pains. I have no resentment of the life that has led me to this point, I am ready to embrace it fully in order to fully reconcile with my Self and move forward to my best life✌🏼

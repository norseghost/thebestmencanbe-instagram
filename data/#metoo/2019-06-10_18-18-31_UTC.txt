We are honored to be working with the sister duo behind @thepassionistasproject, a new community designed to inspire women to live their passion. After spending years working together producing interviews of Hollywood's elite, Nancy and Amy Harrington felt compelled to act in reaction to #metoo and #timesup. The #PassionistasProject podcast highlights stories of women who have taken the leap to bring their dream to life - their most recent interview was with @madcatch, the executive director of @lapride. Go give them a listen on any major listening app. If you like what you hear, rate, review and subscribe! These ladies have some big things in the works ðŸ’•

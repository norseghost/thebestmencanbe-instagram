Set the past on fire, watch it burn. We often set resolutions only to fall back to previous ways. With this image of a burning house and the character watching it burn, it symbolizes finality, a way of seeing it through til the very end. If only more of us would do such then perhaps the past would not come back to haunt us. No matter how much we revisit the past there is nothing new there to see.

‘In 2018/19 I spent a very long time trying to get access to ADHD testing to figure out why I can’t concentrate, stay on task, or regulate my emotions. It took months to get seen and then I had to answer multiple assessment phone calls, despite that being a huge issue for my anxiety. When I was about to be passed over to in person assessment , the worker who had been calling me called an extra time. Only now At 8pm. From a withheld number at his home. There was, it turned out, no real reason to call. He asked vague questions whilst I had to listen to him wanking. I could hear every sound. He built a relationship where he had power, heard all about my traumas, then wanked over the phone at me - knowing I was anxious about phone calls. #mentalhealth #anxiety #sexualharrassment #abuseofpower #metoo #suffolkmentalhealthservices

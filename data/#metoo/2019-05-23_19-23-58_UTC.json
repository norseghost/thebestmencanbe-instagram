We hurt each other \u2014 and our shared cause \u2014 more than any man ever could.\n.\nWhether or not we acknowledge it, society has conditioned us for generations to compete for resources we\u2019ve been scammed into believing are scarce: Husbands and children. Jobs, promotions and raises. Material wealth. Success. Security.\n.\nWe sustain a damaging system of insecurity \u2014 constantly logging one another\u2019s flaws and filing them away for later use \u2014 because we know in any given enterprise there\u2019s only room for one of us at the top. We\u2019ve learned that suppressing our femininity affords us the best hope for success. We have to be in on the joke. \u201cI\u2019m a woman, but not one of THOSE women. Pick me!\u201d\n.\nWe uphold the patriarchy because we\u2019ve learned how to benefit from it. We think we\u2019ve outsmarted the system. White women in particular know that if we don\u2019t make waves, we get all the privileges. We think we get to be in on the joke.\n.\nIn fact, women powered the anti-suffrage movement. A woman led the campaign that prevented the Equal Rights Amendment from becoming law. A woman wrote the Alabama abortion ban; another signed it.\n.\nOne would expect female lawmakers to champion causes that reduce women\u2019s burdens because they personally understand our struggles. But rather than appeal to our shared humanity, many work instead to ensure their own survival: \u201cIf I uphold the standards of the patriarchy in my community, they will empower me.\u201d\n.\nBeing harmed by another woman is the ultimate betrayal \u2014 a puncture wound in our vulnerabilities \u2014 because she fundamentally understands what\u2019s at stake.\n.\nBut the joke\u2019s on us. Men have learned how to exploit it all.\n.\nWe too often pump our girl-power pompoms only to revert to the same behaviors that keep us here. It\u2019s madness.\n.\nThe only way to change this system is to unite in sacrificing the privileges and perceived securities we\u2019ve individually worked so hard to achieve. What are YOU willing to sacrifice? #hysteriaseries\n.\n.\nFeatured: @mouthygoddess\nPhotographer/CreativeDir: @rachaelthompsonphoto\n."

What a funky May I had! Thank goodness, it’s June. As they say, there’s a whole process to #grieving and it sucks.  I know that to be true; but nonetheless, I am MAKING THE CHOICE today to not stay in the funk. It may not go away today, but what I can do is to start taking estimable actions towards joy. One thing I know that works as a funk remedy is to help someone.  When I do something to make someone’s else’s situation a little better or to put a smile on that person’s face, then I feel better. So… that’s what I’m gonna do today:) Who wants to join me?

this was never about kids in the first place. it wasn’t about protecting human lives, it wasn’t about saving capable unborn children that could’ve cured cancer or whatnot. tell me, how can a child find the cure to a previously incurable disease when they are locked in a cage at the border, releasing chilling screams as they watch their own parents being taken away from them? how can a child become a renowned scientist when they are at the hospital, taking their last breath, replaying the day that they watched an angry person with a gun walked into their school? tell me how the brainy child with fingers yearning to learn the language of computers will code a new software when their parents cannot pay for electricity or a computer and their school can only afford second-hand textbooks? of course, these situations aren’t impossible. they can be achieved. but at what sacrifice? at what risk? at what percentage is this achievable? if you’re going to fight to bring children into this world, fight to give them the best resources, the best education, the best protection. fight for all children from all backgrounds, races, and genders. if the only thing you’re fighting for is to restrict mothers from getting rid of unborn squirmy fetuses the size of rice grains, you’re not fighting for children anymore.

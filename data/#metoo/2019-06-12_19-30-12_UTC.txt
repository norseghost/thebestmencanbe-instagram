Abuse comes in many shapes and forms. Those we think love us and care but make us feel worthless, itâ€™s abuse. They may not hit but words and the way they act can actually be worse! Emotional and verbal are abuses that people still hardly talk about, yet can actually be the most damaging. There are many support groups, courses and programs that can help both men and women when it comes to abuse. To see the signs, what to do, how to cope. @sateda_da.service is just one service but is a brilliant one. Please speak up! X

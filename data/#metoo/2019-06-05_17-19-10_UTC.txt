Ep 78. Pure O + Sexual Assault
🌪🧠
An anonymous guest talks about the abuse he experienced as a child, his obsessive thoughts and mental compulsions and the sexual assault he experienced in a foreign country where he was emotionally and physically alone and felt terrified and confused.  This is a really special episode and I feel so much love and compassion towards my guest.  He showed up to my place many months ago and told his scariest feelings and secrets to me, a complete stranger.  I saw the courage then and I still see and feel it now.  He’s a survivor and I’m so grateful he was able to share his story.

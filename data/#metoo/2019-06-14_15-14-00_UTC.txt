Humanity is not falling apart, I think that it is rather opening up. I think this because all over the world people are willing to be who they really are.
.
People become for example more open about their seksuality, a great example of this is the #pridemonth, the world itself also opens up, things that would stay closed open up. An example of this is the #metoo movement that is still growing each and everyday.
.
A big factor in this change is definitely the internet, so much more information is accessible and like-minded people can easier connect what causes them to open also easier up towards the world because they feel supported in who they are, and this causes again the world to open easier up because the world sees that it is okay to open up.
.
Also individuals that don't want the world to change and open up in a certain sense open up, they try to be more open as well because they have to follow this trend of opening up, otherwise they will just lose their role of importance in the world. They share their idea's more openly for example, a great example of this is #donaldtrump.
.
So is the world falling apart or opening up? I think that falling apart is a natural consequence of opening up. I think that we are entering a new age, an age of transparency and openness.
.
So be open and spread the fire.

Came across this garbage on Facebook today.

Dear #fucktards . That’s men and women by the way. If you cannot control yourselves and your impulsions upon seeing a bit of skin (shoulders, chest, midsection, heaven forbid some calves 😱....) you should never leave your house and seek some serious help. 
The whole culture of “she wanted it because she was wearing a mini skirt” while you wank on lesbian porn needs to stop. As in needs to stop now. In 2019. It should have stopped yesterday but hey.... and I will personally make sure that the boys and men, and women if it ever so happens, around me, know that.

Sincerely

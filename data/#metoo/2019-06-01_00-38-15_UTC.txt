DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

When I started on instagram my intention was to offer information about myths and realities about intimate partner coercive control and domestic violence.
But my addiction to taking photos that appeal to me took over. So there will be people who followed me for that reason, but my devotion to photography took over. So I eventually realised I needed to just focus on my love of art and photography on instagram rather than using my many many years of expertise on the issue. So I changed my handle from Clare Murphy PhD to my lack of expertise handle “Clarey” where I get my much needed passionate outlet.

However, today I decided to create a Collage on my expert knowledge. Mostly because my need to collage something on this topic cannot be dismissed.
Hence there will be some people who got confused when I morphed from my original topic and probably wondered “what the????” Instead I use my FaceBook Coercive Control page to share my research. .

ðŸŒ¹ A strong woman stands up for herself. A stronger woman stands up for everyone else. In light of whatever that happened to me recently, i reiterate my stance: that I stand with all who have been a victim, who have been forced to keep quiet, who are too afraid to speak out - Iâ€™m with you. #MeToo

Apparently on a TV show which involves men literally picking women out of a line up and in which the misogyny, sexism and downright disrespect of women is seen as ‘cheeky’ and entertaining (a few years ago, a contestant repeatedly referred to a female contestant as ‘it’), a woman has come in who owns her sexuality and expresses a sexual interest in a man, she’s crass and it is front-page news. Double standards.

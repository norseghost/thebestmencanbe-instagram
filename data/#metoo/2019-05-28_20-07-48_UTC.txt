How ‘bout 
instead
of getting
all up
in my shit
to pretend
like
you want me,
desire me,
without 
knowing me,
you just chill.
How about
if I want to,
I’ll fucking ask you first.
For your name,
for your sign,
for your lips,
if I kiss,
huh,
you’d be that lucky,
baby.

How about this,
if I find you attractive
I’ll hit on you,
but until then,
relax.
Sure yeah,
you can ask
for my number,
and I’ll give it to you.
Because if I don’t,
you’ll probably
be mean,
call me a bitch.
So you got my number,
and I won’t respond.
And when I ghost you,
it drives you crazy.
What you
and most men
do not understand,
is that no message
is the message.
So then you text again,
and I ghost you again.
You feel like
you’re going crazy,
but really
you should just
relax,
sit back
and chill.
But you can’t,
or you won’t,
so you find me online,
send me a DM on Insta.
“Not sure
if you gave me
the right number,
I’m so and so
from there and then,
we can start as friends!”
No dude,
we won’t start as friends,
there will never
be a beginning.
The third time
is not the charm,
because the first time
was not charming.
I hope
that when you die,
all the women
that ghosted you
are there waiting.
Maybe then
you’ll begin
to understand,
the constant
harassment of men.
Maybe some of them
did give you
the wrong number.
I’m sure they will
be everything
you imagined.
Others will sit you down,
and explain
why they ghosted you.
Perhaps others,
actually died,
and just couldn’t
text you back.
Then there will be the ones,
that still
don’t want anything
from you.
That’s your chance,
to be a better man,
learn from your life,
chill, relax,
realise the truth
why she didn’t
text you back.

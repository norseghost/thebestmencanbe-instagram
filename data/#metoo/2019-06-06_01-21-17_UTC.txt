Absolutely loved having yoga tonight at @farmers_table with @justbreatheyogacenter ! The perfect way to end my day and now I’m ready for bed 😴! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I’m also loving putting oils in my water! I used to be so addicted to soda and other sugary drinks that my body was probably shocked when it ever actually got water 😅 I just need flavor you know, can’t be drinking that basic water! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Tonight I added Citrus Fresh 🍊 It’s a combo of citrus oils with an extra kick of spearmint. I call it my spa water because it makes me feel fancy AF 💁🏼‍♀️ It not only detoxes the body but is also great for relieving stress which is perfect for your zen session! 🧘🏻‍♀️

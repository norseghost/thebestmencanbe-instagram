It lets us know something is wrong, and it calls attention to something that matters if not to ourselves, then to someone else. Anger consumes a lot of energy and singular focus. It\u2019s raw and messy, and makes us uncomfortable.\n.\nWe are repulsed by anger in our society, so we do everything we can to avoid expressing it. Women in particular tend to rationalize our anger, which not only invalidates the pain at the root of it, but also prevents us from growing and embracing all of the things we can learn from it.\n.\nBelieving that our anger is irrelevant or that it\u2019s wrong to express it leaves us at its mercy. So, today, I\u2019m honoring it.\n.\nIt makes me angry when:\n.\nThe government tries to tell me what I can and cannot do with my body;\n.\nThe government cages children and claims it\u2019s for my protection;\n.\nThe government imprisons dissenters and whistleblowers;\n.\nPolice murder people of color;\n.\nPolice get away with murdering people of color (or anyone for that matter);\n.\nMen think they can touch me without my consent;\n.\nWomen get paid less for jobs we\u2019re as good or better at doing than men;\n.\nWomen stab each other in the back;\n.\nFriends don\u2019t show up for you, but still expect you to show up for them;\n.\nPeople lie;\n.\nPeople cheat;\n.\nPeople steal;\n.\nPeople pretend they are something they are not;\n.\nPeople don\u2019t stand up for themselves or others;\n.\nPeople judge others for something they themselves are unwilling to do;\n.\nPeople don\u2019t try their best;\n.\nPeople play both sides of the fence;\n.\nPeople take advantage of other people;\n.\nPeople make assumptions about me;\n.\nPeople don\u2019t listen, with their minds or their hearts;\n.\nPeople think they are better than me;\n.\nPeople tell me I\u2019m too angry or overreacting;\n.\nPeople call me crazy;\n.\nPeople tell me I\u2019m not likable enough;\n.\nPeople try to invalidate my feelings;\n.\nPeople don\u2019t take me seriously;\n.\nI do any of the above.\n.\n.\nWhat makes YOU angry? Let it out in the comments. #hysteriaseries\n.\n.\nFeatured: @mouthygoddess\nPhotographer/CreativeDir: @rachaelthompsonphoto\n."

It is not your fault NOR your responsibility to make someone else ready to exchange the love you have between you two.  All you can do is make your way onto the bridge and offer your love, your offering.  It is their responsibility to meet you 1/2 way. 
And only YOU know whether they are meeting you half way or not.  Do not let others influence what you feel thru your intuition.  Since words are ONLY 40% of communication - you might feel the energy of their effort and/or they might be “talking” in the way they can showing-  you their effort. 
Only you can listen beyond the words to know what is being said and if that meets what you need.

Well here they are ! The "Before" pictures! I will note though, I did not take a photo right off the bat, this is the yard after the about 40 hours I've already worked on it in the last week! Which has been quite the physical and mental strain but I feel the drive to do it! It feels very good! will post daily updates of the progress!

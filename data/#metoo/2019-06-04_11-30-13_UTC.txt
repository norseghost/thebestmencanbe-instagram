Sometimes you have to get a little up close and personal. I aim to share my story with you one day at a time. ⠀

It took a while for me to feel comfortable to share anything with anyone. That is why I frequently wrote. I felt as though I was writing to a friend without judgment.⠀
⠀

⠀
Today, I stand before you plus-size, in-love, working on my self-love journey, finding healthy habits, coping with my anxiety, and repairing my scars of sexual encounters past. ⠀

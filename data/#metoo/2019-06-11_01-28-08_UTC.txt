What are false preachers like? How can I detect them? They are charismatic, proud, and arrogant individuals. They often preach for prestige and for financial gain. They will come off as egotistic, self-indulgent, self-centered, fashion-centered, money-centered, and promotion-centered. Watch them. You will see it. Donâ€™t doubt what you see from their behavior.

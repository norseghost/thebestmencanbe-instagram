The highest honor one can receive in the state of Texas is the “Yellow Rose” today I was inducted. This is a hand picked honor by the Governor and only the Governor ❤️ I learned being in God’s will and being obedient will change your life indefinitely 🙌🏽 I’m not always posting but I’m always working 🙏🏾 #MeToo #love

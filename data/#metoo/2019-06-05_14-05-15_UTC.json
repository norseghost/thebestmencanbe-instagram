                        "text": "Give love \nBe love \nSpread love \n#ptsd \nI have massive PTSD from my abusive marriage, my survival of incest, survival of Rape and abortion, survival of sexual harassment in Corp America....I didn\u2019t realize that is what it was....I thought it was \u2018anger\u2019 or \u2018hatred\u2019 toward him and the \u2018situation\u2019 and image o gave off as an easy target. Self destructive behavior for years, low self esteem, bad choices, fear. But it is PTSD. I am not ashamed to say it. I am a survivor and always will be. I never lose and never will. (I gotta keep telling myself that) \nI have always felt like a fighter and strong not realizing I was just putting up walls of safety. Protecting myself from pain. Only till I took the journey for a year, isolated myself away from \u2018where I got sick\u2019 and \u2018who was fueling the behavior on repeat, did I heal. \nI walked away from a lucrative career to take time for myself to heal. Learned to embrace meditation. Started writing and writing and writing. Getting all the stories and memories out of my brain into paper was the most healing aspect of my journey. :\nThe abuse, molestation, rape, not of these terrible things that happened to me in my life define me. None. Getting #fibromyalgia from all of the trauma doesn\u2019t define me! However, it is present daily and real. But staying in light and love and giving back is my strength. Giving to others gives me strength. #mitzvah :\nDon\u2019t judge others and assume they are \u2018crazy\u2019 or not give the time to understand what they are going through. If you know someone who has had struggles, a veteran, a single mom, an abused or rape survivor, reach out this month. Send a card. Give a smile. Be kind. Educate yourself on PTSD. \n#belove #givelove #spreadlove #ptsd #survivor #stopdomesticviolence #livewithintention #prochoice #rape #stopjudgingothers #bekind #faceforwardla #stillstanding #metoo"

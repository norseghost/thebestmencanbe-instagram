To the industry, they are known as production units. To the consumer, they are known as dairy, eggs, meat, wool, leather, test subjects, exhibits. To each other, they are known as mother, son, sister, friend. To themselves, they are simply what you and I are to ourselves: a self-aware, self-contained world of subjective experiences, feelings, fears, memories. Someone with the absolute certainty that his or her life is worth living.

The notion that we are entitled to decide which lives matter and which lives are disposable is at the root of all oppression in the world. What separates us from other animals is as superficial as our physical appearance. What connects us, what makes us equal, is as profound as the core reality of our shared sentience.

We must be willing to examine the biases and bigotries of the present, put yourself in their place, and see them with the same critical eyes we use to view humanity’s heinous crimes of the past.  Until we do, we will remain trapped by our ignorance and prejudice, locked in an age that is much darker than the one we just may be on the brink of stepping into.

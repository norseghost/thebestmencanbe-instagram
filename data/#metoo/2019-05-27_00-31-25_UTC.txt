*Trigger Warning*

The new post is now up if anyone wants to read. Moving forward with this series, there will be mentions of assault, suicidality, suicidal attempts, and self-harming incidents.

For survivors, I hope that you're able to take solace in the fact that you are not alone in your healing and maybe gain some closure for traumas that have never been fully dealt with.

For others, I wish only to provide perspective. I hope that my story changes the way people interact with others for the better. Everyone has a struggle, none of us are perfect, but we can always have a little more compassion.

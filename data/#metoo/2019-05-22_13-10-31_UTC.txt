“A celebration of how movements like #MeToo and #SetHerFree have empowered women around the world to change the status quo.” The 2017 @TIME person(s) of the year were the “Silence Breakers”; women who spoke up against sexual abuse and harassment, including the figureheads of the ‘Me Too’ movement. The #SetHerFree campaign, spearheaded by ‘Women for Refugee Women’, campaigned for years to change the laws. They have shown how grass-roots activism and the power of sisterhood can bring about real change. Marchu Girma, Deputy Director for @4refugeewomen joins us at #sonatalks2019 to tell their story and what lessons we can learn from their experiences.

We wanted to begin sharing our knowledge with both candidates and hiring managers, so going forward we will be implementing #TipTuesday!
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Today's tip is specific to candidates. There is one thing that even some high-level professionals don't realize they should do at the beginning of a phone interview.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
When you answer the phone, answer professionally with "Hello, this is (your name)." Not only will the interviewer know that they have reached the right number, but it also leaves a positive first impression.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
A bonus tip that is often overlooked is to make sure you plan ahead to be in a quiet place with good reception. Nothing ruins a phone interview more than static or a noisy background.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €

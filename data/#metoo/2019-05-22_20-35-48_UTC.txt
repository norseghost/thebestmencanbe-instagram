Thank you @booksparks and @beverlyengel for sending me this copy of I’m saying No! This is a very important topic and I’m glad this resource is available. This book went on sale May 2.⁣
⁣
This book is a self-help book written for women who are afraid to speak up for themselves. I am not a big self help book reader myself, but I think this is a great resource and it is helpful for all of us to learn more about this important topic. I’m lucky to not have a personal experience with sexual assault but I am here for support and help to those who need it.⁣

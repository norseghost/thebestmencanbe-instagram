Who knew so many #murders have happened so close to home, that are still #unsolved? I'm finally sharing with you the stories behind the photos we shot for the #MMIW or Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women movement. â€¢Warning: extremely graphic content, reader discretion  is advised. 
Follow the link in my bio to read about the cases of Angela, Lynette & Selena, & Melissa.

Thank you to the families who have been open to share their stories, @kolashippentower
& @stillafightr.

If you think you know any information about these cases that might help, please do not hesitate to call Tribal or Pendleton police.

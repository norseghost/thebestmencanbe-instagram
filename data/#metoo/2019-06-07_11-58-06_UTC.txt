Of course many will say “Lucky you!  At least you don’t have to co-parent with a narcissist.”

And I’m sure people who make such comments aren’t meaning to be invalidating.  But there actually is an element of invalidation in such comments.  Which is why I’d like to acknowledge all the women out there who’ve been abused and left pregnant  by narcissists and sociopaths who’ve refused to even acknowledge their own children. 
Yes, it’s true that a #sociopath or #narcissist is incapable of being a healthy parent.
However, here’s the thing......To carry and give birth to and nurture a child that has been thoroughly disrespected, ignored and spoken about with contempt by the very “man” who created the baby is a kind of trauma you cannot even fathom unless you’ve been through it.

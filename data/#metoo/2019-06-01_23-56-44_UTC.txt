Looking back on the years of abuse I experienced, one dynamic that my abuser could manipulate was my fear of having (or being written off for) a bad reputation. If the abuser, a housemate, or that Sunday's sermon implied that I was being unforgiving not to overlook the latest wound or that I was being overly sensitive, I staid. When fearing him or dissolving into depression had gotten to be too much, I attempted to leave about 5 times, but because I was scared of being a bad guy, I was easily roped back in. In my case, disclosing about the abuse opened the floodgates to attack on my personal character and my spiritual health. As it turns out, my fears were valid.

Gender-based violence and abuse is inextricably linked to the tightrope walk women endure to preserve their reputation. ➖ Negatives to be avoided include: bitchy, bossy, high-maintenance, desperate, clingy, shrill, frigid, frumpy, hormonal, hysterical, emotional, sensitive, slutty, etc. ➕ Positives that must be maintained include: girly, upbeat, forgiving, kind, calm, objective, submissive, prayerful (note how "feminine" virtues essentially prevent resistance.) An abusive man can lean into these words to control his female partner. She rightly suspects that if she exposes him, leaves, or fails to comply she is at risk of not only being labeled by him but by the community she needs in order to escape and heal.

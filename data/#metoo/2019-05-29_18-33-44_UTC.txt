And heâ€™s off...first to the Provo MTC then to the Ukraine Dnepropetrovsk Mission. Thank you to everyone for all the love you have showered upon Riley this past weekend (and throughout his life.) He felt so loved. Oh how I love this boy and his tender heart. God be with you â€˜til we meet again. ðŸ’”

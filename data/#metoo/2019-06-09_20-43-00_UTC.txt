Emma Thompson, the two-time Academy Award winner and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, has been an activist since long before we preferred, or expected, our celebrities that way. She's protested the Gulf War and the Iraq War, fracking, arctic drilling and #Brexit. Recently she's spoken plainly and fervently about the #MeToo movement, #climatechange and the refugee crisis. One headline a decade ago read: doth the lady protest too much? She's never seemed to think so. "Suddenly you'll be in this place where all the roles that society has so successfully forced upon you from daughter to wife to mother to professional person-could be questioned," says Thompson, of @latenightmovie, written by co-star @mindykaling. "You could take these things away from your face, one after the other, and go, 'Who actually am I?' Which I've always thought was a terribly boring question, and I find fascinating." Thompson, who for so long was ahead of her time, finds herself in a time when women are getting their due, protest is popular and caring is cool. Has the moment finally caught up to her?

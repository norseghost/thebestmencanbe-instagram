I hope you remember that it\u2019s okay to not be okay sometimes, and find the strength to open up to the people who truly want to support you (and let go of those who don\u2019t because you deserve better than that). \ud83d\udda4 I also have to say thank you to my amazing friends for being those people for me (you know who you are \ud83d\udc95). Thank you for reminding me that I don\u2019t always have to be the strong one when I try to get away with telling you \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d, for proving to me that I can still trust people, and for encouraging me to start stepping back out of my comfort zone (especially looking at you on that one @meowbrina \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude18) and taking down the big walls I\u2019ve built up, even when it\u2019s scary. During the hardest moments you all reminded me that it will get better & there are still so many beautiful things worth living for, now it\u2019s my turn to pass that message on to whoever needs to hear it. \ud83d\udc95 #mentalhealthawarenessmonth #metoo #mentalhealthawareness #sendinglove"

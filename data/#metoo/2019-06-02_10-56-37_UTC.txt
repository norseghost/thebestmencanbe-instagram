Listening to this woman talk brought me pure admiration. What a woman?! To stand up and speak publicly to all those who will listen is the only way to implement change. Change to perceptions, change to people's behaviours and change for yourself to be able to accept others have done you wrong and the way forward is by not hiding and feeling shameful.

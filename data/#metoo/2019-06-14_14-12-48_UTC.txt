Yeah so this is definitely true. No neopronous have been added to the dictionary (yet).
⠀⠀
In my opinion, it is not transphobic to use they/them for someone using a neopronous. If you are using neopronous, you do not identify as a male or a female, and therefore you're a 'them' (you are not him or her). What do you think?⬇️

R. Kelly was back court yesterday where he pleaded ‘not guilty’ to multiple charges related to sexual abuse. The spotlight is back on Kelly after some incredible journalism and the documentary ‘Surviving R. Kelly’ gave a platform to alleged survivors. I spoke with one of these women about her experience. You can hear more of her powerful story on @nbcnewsnow

R. Kelly denies all accusations against him. .

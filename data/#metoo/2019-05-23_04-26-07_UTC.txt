When I started this movement over a year ago in a subreddit of a few hundred people I knew it would be an uphill battle, and I fully expected to receive some backlash. After all I was openly and publicly sharing my story of sexual violence in the doctor's office, advocateing against something most women simply accept as an unfortunate part of life, and making some very serious and controversial accusations against medical professionals, especially those in #gynecology

This was not something I expected though.

Earlier today this person came onto a tweet of mine discussing why I feel the #lifesavingwax and #ihadmine campaigns are problematic and harmful to women who #SayNoToSmears and how they inadvertently breed anger and hatred towards these women. This individual was nice at first, asking genuine questions and engaging in discussion with me. Until my answers to their questions were no longer what they wanted to hear, then they lashed out, got hostile and aggressive. They began to mock me for suffering from #ptsd and told me that I am an embarrassment to women, and unstable, and my triggers make me weak, too sensitive, and nit picky. Even threatened to sue me for quoting an insulating message they sent me back at them. I don't share this with you because I want you to feel sorry for me, or attack this person for me. I share it with you so maybe you'll think twice about what you share online in regard to #cervicalscreening and how you view so called #cervicalcancerawareness campaigns. Because regardless of their good intentions they inadvertently encourage this kind of behavior. Some women don't to participate in cervical screening and that is okay and should be respected. These people should not be attacked and should not have to defend their right to decide what happens to thier vagina tooth and nail against a stranger who doesn't know thier story and certainly never has a right do this

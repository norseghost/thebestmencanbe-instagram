“girls love girls and boys, and love is not a choice.” - Brendon Urie, Panic! At The Disco, Girls/Girls/Boys🌈
❤️
these videos are from when i saw P!ATD in Birmingham, UK on 26th March this year😍
🧡
he stole loads of LGBTQ+ flags and wore them while he sang Girls/Girls/Boys🌈
💛
there were also different coloured bits of confetti on seats in different blocks all around the stadium, so everyone could make a pride flag out of it😍
💚
he then made a speech at the end (i only caught the last bit) where he said how love is love and everyone should be free...“thankyou very much for existing, and for letting me sweat all over these beautiful flags”...he’s amazing🌈
💙
HAPPY PRIDE MONTH🏳️‍🌈

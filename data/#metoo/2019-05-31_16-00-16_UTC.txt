What did you say?
It doesn't matter!
No time to hear about this!
Maybe later...
Why? Why the fuck should you wait for someone elses precious time to hear you out? To hear what you have to say?? Don't your opinions matter? Don't you have a say?
Of course you do!! Every word you speak and statement you make, with facts and figures, or just a tale to tell, but it counts. If someone doesn't have the time to listen to you- don't bother wasting your breath on them! Your opinions are so important, and it's high time you realize that! And I'm not saying this to boost your self-esteem, and self-confidence. But, this is about your voice. The whole reason, and purpose of your existence is because you do make a damn difference in the world.

Everyone has a different outlook and perspective of their life and the world around them. Stop being judgemental fools and conclude on others emotions with incomplete information. Always listen to what others have to say, their opinions do matter. It's only going to give you a wider reach to knowledge and better adaptability to different people. And that is when you speak up too because along with what others have to say, your opinions are so fucking important too!!

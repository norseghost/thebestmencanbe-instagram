Content warning: sexual assault
.
“Rape drains the light. I want to let some light back in.”
—Sohaila Abdulali (What We Talk About When We Talk About Rape)
.
Sometimes I feel like we’re inundated with portrayals of sexual assault in the media, but we don’t actually *talk* about it, and that’s why this book means so much to me. Sohaila Abdulali is my new hero, as she gives a voice to so many sexual assault survivors who have been overlooked in the age of #MeToo, and she exposes aspects of rape culture that have long been considered “normal.”
.
This book also helped me realize something very important: I’m done with media that trivializes sexual assault in any way. Last night, I started reading a popular novel that used a conversation about rape as comic relief, and I closed it immediately. These conversations need to happen, but they should NEVER happen lightly.
.
I know this is an ugly topic, but if you’re thinking about picking up this book please please do. And take care of yourself while you read it.

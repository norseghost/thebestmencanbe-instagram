Shame on you Instagram!! As a women I donâ€™t appreciate being harassed by men who think itâ€™s appropriate to send me sleazy â€˜oh youâ€™re so beautifulâ€™ messages asking me to contact them ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤¬! It does not make me feel safe or welcomed and yes it is harassment! 
So if you message me in such a way, I will block you, I will report you. This is unacceptable and I want this environment to be safe for my daughters!

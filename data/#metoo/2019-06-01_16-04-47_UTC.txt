CW: domestic violence and assault against women .

1 in 3 women have experienced domestic violence in Australia. On average, one woman a week is murdered by her current or former partner .

I’ve never aired this story .

When I was 20, I was thrown across a room out of my on/off boyfriends way, after being kicked into the doorway. I was thrown like a rag doll, as I was in his way out of the room. My face landed on a windowsill and I lost my front teeth and broke my upper jaw .

There are lots of points that got to that, but it was a one sided physical attack that has left me tens of thousands in dental bills and a lifetime of “issues” .

Today that man came into a pub I was sitting in. .

I imagined that I would handle such a situation well. However, I had learned in years past that I was only the first of his victims of physical assault and not the last to lose their front teeth .

I had been informed of various predatory ways of him interacting and dating women .

The person in my mind had become a terrifying monster .

So when I saw him. My body went into extreme fight it flight mode. In this instance, flight .

I ran. I told my boyfriend we had to leave “immediately” and bolted .

I’ve been beating myself up for not standing my ground. For allowing him to have power over me after all this time. I’m unable to sleep. Lying terrified of a non existent boogeyman .

Why am I telling this story? This happened more than 15 years ago now. I reported the assault and was “strongly encouraged” to drop the charges by his family who were scared it would ruin his career and life. I have shouldered guilt, wondering if I’d just been brave that other women may have been spared? .

I’m not the first person to say #metoo years later. We don’t speak up when it happens because we are scared .

But you know what? Today I learned I’m still scared. I wish I’d spoken up and stood my ground 15 years ago. I support anyone who wants to come forward 1 day later or 10 years .

I’m here for you and understand. I have nothing but love for you .

Even though it might feel like there is no one in the world 💓

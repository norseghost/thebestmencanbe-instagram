It’s been a year... my speaking out came fast, somewhat unexpected, somewhat as a force to protect myself and my family, and in that I have gained myself and my sense of self that I lost and so much clarity... I remember waiting after endless interviews and fact checking and questions while sick and pregnant... waiting sick for when this was going to come out... and then it did. The paper had called in a photographer who had shot Weinstein’s victims and the journalist flew to Austin for the last interview and I remember her sitting with us and I broke down crying and couldn’t continue... I was a chaos of strength and weakness and trauma and hormones... it was one of the hardest times in my life. I will always cherish deeply those who were supportive and showed me love and compassion during that. This will be the year I make A change in other survivors lives and I will spread love and compassion and I will create a network for those who are alone in this. I have come so far in gaining clarity... even on my hard days, I know I was put here and given this platform to make a change... #metoo #timesup #metoomovement #usatoday #survivor #womenempowerment

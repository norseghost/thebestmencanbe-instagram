Crazy Geo Story: Sometime in 2009 or so I found myself in Oakridge.  My geotechnical consulting firm assigned me to be the carbon monoxide monitor for a FUCKING rail gang. I doubt you know about rail gangs. They are mostly Native American dudes who roam the country all year maintaining our nation's main line of commerce. As a young repressed goth girl in Utah, I spent my High School graduation night hopping box cars to Ogden and back. So you know I was totally into this assignment. They fit tested me with a mask. They gave me a  carbon monoxide monitoring device. I met up with the superintendent and he gave me a ride into the forest in his truck that can convert to ride rails. It was thrilling! I noted that in the cab of the truck there was a photo album with a lady on it, posing. We got to the first tunnel. The gang was already there, replacing rail with weird belching complicated machines manned by giant, beautiful native guys with thick black braids. We stared at each other. They never saw a girl on a rail gang before. So I spent the day donning the mask and entering each tunnel first, and testing the atmosphere to ensure their safety. It was awesome!
On the way back, the superintendent showed me his photo album. He said his hobby is to take "nature portraits" of ladies in the woods, in their "natural state". He said he takes the stipend and camps in the woods, and invited me to join him. It was clear. I took the address he scrawled on a scratch paper. I let him take a photo of me with my phone. You can see my crossed arms to guess my level of discomfort. He dropped me off at my car. I said I'd see him later and then I drove home. #story #stories #womeninengineering #storycorps #women #almostraped #geotechnical #oakridge #ldsapostate #fffound #womeninconstruction #metoo

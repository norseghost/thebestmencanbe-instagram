I started to power through writing the May blog entry I'd envisioned, after posting the question I realized I need to answer for myself. But one of the ways I've changed, since the moment I first hit "publish" on my story, is recognizing that overachieving and overcommitting are survival techniques. Not only do they no longer serve me well - they endanger my physical health. (I still don't value my own mental health the way I do for others... I wish I could let that be reason enough, but one thing at a time). So I'm going to hold that thought, and honor my body, and encourage you to be kind to yourselves - whatever that means for you.

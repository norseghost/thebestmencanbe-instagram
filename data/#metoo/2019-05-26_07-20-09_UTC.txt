It feels that I have too much on my plate all the time. I am preaching against overworking, yet fall into the same trap over and over again. But it is hard to stop when I am surrounded by many inspiring people who do wonderful things and bring so much love in the world. They light up the world and light a spark in me that makes me wanna do more.
It is a refreshing feeling after years of being stuck with toxic people and feeling low and unmotivated, really.
Who is the most inspiring person in your life?

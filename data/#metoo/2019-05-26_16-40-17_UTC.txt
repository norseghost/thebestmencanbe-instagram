The Usual Suspects (1995) Dir. Bryan Singer (🖕🏼).
.
This film might be directed by a nonce and star a sexual predator, but the other hundreds of people involved in the making of this movie from cast and crew need to be acknowledged for their work. It shouldn’t slip under the radar because of 2 rotten apples.
. 
When it all comes together in the final moment. That last scene. Speechless. “The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist”.

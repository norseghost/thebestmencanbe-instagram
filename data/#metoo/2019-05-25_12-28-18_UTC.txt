Sexual harassment is real and there is no woman/girl who didn’t go through it. The idea that my future daughter or younger cousin could be subject to it makes me realise that I need to be vocal about it now. How many times have I found myself in dangerous situations and only because of my alertness I was able to escape these situations. How many times have I been told as a woman that I was “overreacting” being “too sensitive/dramatic” or couldn’t take a joke. Sexual harassment can happen anywhere from your workplace to the tube station to your own home

It doesn’t matter at what age this happens. You could be 16 or 30 or 40 but regardless it is a traumatic experience. We live in a society where #sexualharassment is so normalised that unless somebody sees you being #raped in broad daylight nothing would be done. This is the reason why when I am out alone I think about all these possible scenarios of what I would do if that man who is staring at me on the bus/work/uni doors something, this is the reason why we call each other in the middle of the night to make sure that we got home safe even after taking taxi, this is the reason why so many women don’t come forward and worst of all is that the very people who are in power and should be protecting us are he very people who perpetuate this behaviour.

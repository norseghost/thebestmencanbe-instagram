What a miserable Monday! However I did have a pretty successful weekend so I can’t be too disheartened. I finally finished Michelle Obama’s biography which took me soooo long. Not because I didn’t enjoy it, but because I had to stop reading it before bed because it was making me think too much, have to many ideas and I couldn’t get to sleep! I’m hoping to find a Michelle quote to put on a candle, but for now here is my Barak inspired candle. “This is what a feminist looks like” challenging the stereotype that men can’t be feminists. What’s the most annoying stereotype you’ve heard about feminists?

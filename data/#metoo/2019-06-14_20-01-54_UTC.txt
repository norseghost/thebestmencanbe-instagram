This will go down in history, hopefully much more than the most shared event of the day. I always wanted to have a boy because I was too scared to bring a girl into this world so she wouldnâ€™t live what I have. This is so wrong. Women deserve equal rights and above all to feel safe and respected. This so much bigger than equal pay for equal work. #grevedesfemmes #frauenstreik2019 #grevedesfemmes2019 #grevedesfemmesfribourg #womenstrike #equality #metoo #womenmarch #switzerland #fribourg

Leonor Fini (1907 - 1996)

Known for her fantastical dress and wild hair, she seems like a character cooked up by Tim Burton. The Argentine artist eschewed marriage, choosing to live always with two men (one as a boyfriend, one as a friend) and a dozen or so cats. Largely self-taught, Fini moved from Buenos Aires to Italy as a young woman and then onto Paris around, where she experimented with painting, graphic design, and costume and set design. 
A friend of Salvador Dalí, Man Ray, and Max Ernst, she cultivated a Surrealist style (though she never considered herself a part of the movement) with works that dove deeply into the psyche of male and female dynamics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Fini worked on costumes and sets for films such as Federico Fellini’s 8 ½, and John Huston’s A Walk With Love (Anjelica Huston’s first film). She was said to have once brazenly asked Picasso why he kept doing "the same old shit." Fini's refusal to defer to the art world or to its artistic royalty is one of the many reasons she is so intriguing...and so hard to pin down as an artist. Her style can be described as something between dreamy surrealism, ornate rococo, and sensual decadence. Much of her work focuses on solitary female figures and uncanny animals in personal dreamscapes akin to the deeply psychological world of fellow-surrealist Frida Kahlo.

Fini’s cats traveled with her by limousine, “packed into their own car in little wicker baskets—four or five in the front and fifteen or so in the back.” #leonorfini #femaleartist #womenartist #feminism alepainter #femalephotographer #femalesculptor #femmeartiste #mujerartista #künstlerin #artistafemenina #artistafeminista #womenempowerment #empowerfemaleartists #womenforwomen #feminism #metoo #artsfemin #feminist #metoo

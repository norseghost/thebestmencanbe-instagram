****Trigger Warning****Part 2: On Dec. 1, 2013, Tesema was drunk and high on khat, an African plant stimulant. When he began to rape her, she grabbed a knife and stabbed him. He swiped the knife from her, cutting her hand. She grabbed another knife and stabbed him 30 times, according to court documents. Tesema stumbled to a bathroom and locked the door. Shefa called 911, and police found his naked body in the bathtub. She said “I did not mean to kill him, I just needed him to stop raping me.” Over the course of a 2 ½-hour interrogation, she told a detective of the abuse. “I am not even afraid of Allah as I am afraid of him. I am afraid of him all the time.” Tesema's family thinks Shefa is a gold-digging killer who murdered her loving husband. They said Tesema was a gentle, giving man and that they never saw him abuse Shefa. They believe she used him to get out of Ethiopia and come to the United States. However, the court put out a written decision saying the statements by Tesema’s family not credible. Instead, the evidence corroborated Shefa’s account of that night and of the monthslong abuse, based on what was found at the scene, such as sex paraphernalia and pornography in the room where she stabbed Tesema. Neither she nor Tesema were clothed. After police arrived, Shefa consistently reported she was abused by the victim and a witness for the state said Tesema had previously acknowledged verbal abuse of Shefa. Read full story on the site

In the Era where everyone is using #metoo for attention, there is a little girl too ashamed to talk, a girl who never knew what was right and what was wrong for her, she never knew what she was going through.
All she knew was that it didn't feel good when her uncle touched her in places and made her touch places. I see thousand of YouTube videos spreading awareness about good touch, bad touch and what not but do adults actually talk to kids about it, I know a few might have but that's not a good number. Why is this talk forbidden, why feel ashamed to tell your child who is unaware of what he or she might go through and what they must do in such situation.
I just want to say one thing, precaution is better than cure.
So do whatever you think is right just remember everyone can be a victim and you never know who it might be.

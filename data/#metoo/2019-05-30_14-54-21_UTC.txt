This is so true.... It's when I was going through one of the darkest moments in life that I came to the point where I stopped asking God "WHY?" to asking God "What is do you want for me to learn from this?" That is when my bad days started to turn into my good days.

Always remember there is no battle God can't WIN and he will never put more on you than you can handle.  You are Forever FAT.  A true Fighter, Achiever, & Thriver.

i canâ€™t believe how much better life is when youâ€™re not depressed or suicidal!! it feels like iâ€™ve been colorblind for the past 10 years but now i can see all the pretty pinks and yellows and greens and blues again. i seriously canâ€™t even put into words how amazing it feels to be so happy, healthy, and stable. itâ€™s crazy because i remember when i prayed to be who and where i am now, i just never thought it was possible for a 4x suicide attempt survivor like me; but here i am!!! wow iâ€™m just soooooo grateful to be alive ðŸ¦‹

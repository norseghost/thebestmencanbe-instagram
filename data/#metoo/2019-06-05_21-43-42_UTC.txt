My collection at @nyagallery this month draws attention to the importance of women’s spirituality. Women are suffering at the hands of regular political attacks on their choices, shame at their biology, and discrimination-based inequality; out of necessity, I believe women must establish a strong sense of self before looking outward and trying to right the effects of those wrongs. Connecting to ourselves and connecting to the earth are the first steps into finding a true center, and from that center we can move beyond ourselves and into the political. From center, we can find truth and drive and love, and only once we have found them for ourselves can we begin to share.

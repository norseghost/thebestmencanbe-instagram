#KanyeWest defended Trump supporters to David Letterman and explained his reasoning for wearing the “#MakeAmericaGreatAgain” hat.

In the hour-long special for the second season of Letterman’s Netflix show, Kanye reportedly talked about his battle with bipolar disorder, his new music and long-running feud with #Drake.

Letterman, who has promised in the past not to talk about #Trump on his show, was sparring with West about the rapper’s anxiety as a man in the #MeToo movement, when Yeezy brought up his perplexing relationship with #DonaldTrump. “This is like my thing with Trump—we don’t have to feel the same way, but we have the right to feel what we feel,” West said.

He then went on to explain that wearing the Trump campaign hat is “not about politics,” and he doesn’t even vote. Instead, he said he’s sticking up for Trump supporters heckled over their politics.

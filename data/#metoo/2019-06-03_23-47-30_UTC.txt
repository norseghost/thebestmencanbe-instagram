When things are tough or you have a traumatic situation going on. 
When life just seems like one hard thing after another. 
All you want to do is crawl under the covers and hide.

You might be suffering from self-pity.
We might be agreeing with self-pity.
You might just be nourishing and feeding self-pity.

Is that really what you want?

And you feel that way that is the time when it's most important to get up and do something. Even if it's one little thing like take a shower. Make a piece of toast. Walk around your house.
Do anything except what you're doing now.

What's something you do when you don't feel so good?

Tonight I disclosed my trauma. All of it, event after event, tears spurting down my face. I left out all the really gory bits, the bits I still  dream about, but I was as honest as my wee heart could be.
Tonight was the first time in a long while I cried. My friend cried. We shared my pain, my suffering. I don't think I've ever been so candid in a retelling of my life changing events. Of the true reasons why I cower and hide away. Friends and lovers have come and gone with out knowing, family members too.
Tonight I felt the weight of my story, heavy on my chest, trying to drown me. But all I feel is pride. People may see someone low functioning when they look at me, but I am not. I have come from literal hell. I've battled long and hard to become this version of me, the version of me that is doing it all dispite the odds. Who is changing her life every small step at a time, who is making weekly progress. Who is going back to school. Who is writing and being reconized for her writing. Basically I'm bloody brilliant. I've over come so much, and I'll keep growing and ill keep learning and I'll keep healing.

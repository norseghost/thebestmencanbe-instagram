“Whenever I speak, I know I’m not  the only one in the room that has been raped or sexually abused, and I want them to know they are not alone. They are not responsible. There is no situation in which rape or sexual abuse was their fault. I want them to know how strong they are for surviving.” Elizabeth Smart

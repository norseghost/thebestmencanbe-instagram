As Promised, “My World Needs You: A Peaceful Protest” ministered last year at Freshwind Worship Arts Conference in Macon, GA. Our company has really been dealing with Social Issues and Events happening outside of the Church walls and battling with the Questions: “Where’s the Church during all of this?” And “What are we Doing to Help?” Our peaceful protest not only brought awareness to the Real Protests happening outside our building, but bringing that Protest inside to ask the Viewers; “Now what are we doing as Christian Believers?” Soooo many Layers to this Work! Enjoy! ‼️TAG @kirkfranklin ‼️

                        "text": "Since Isaac\u2019s birth 10 months ago, I\u2019ve been contemplating a lot about how to bring up a boy to be his true best self in a world defined by serial sexual predators like Harry Weinstein and the mainly female-led #metoo movement - basically a society demonised by gender inequality and sexual harrassment and rape. \nUnfortunately, many are rushing into conclusions that men are the problem where in fact, it\u2019s toxic masculinity that is the issue to be investigated. \nI\u2019ve recently read an article in The New Yorker that discussed the challenges mothers as well as fathers raised when bringing up boys these days. While many agreed that PAW Patrol clearly doesn\u2019t explore emotional development, a bigger issue was detected: \u201cthe fragility of male identity. When we make a girl play with a truck, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to make her less of a girl. But, when we think of a boy playing with a doll, we think it\u2019s going to weaken his essence as a man. It\u2019s the same with girls wearing pants but what about boys wearing a skirt?\u201d A Dad website called Fatherly recently organised a meet up to explore the #metoo movement and what men can do to help (women were invited too). So they turned the harassment discussion inside out. \u201cThe courageous conversation that us men have to have is: who among us?\u201d Some men shifted in their seats. \u201cInstead of looking at how many victims there are on the women\u2019s side, how many perpetrators on the men\u2019s side do we know in our lives, in our homes, with our friendships, in our office spaces?\u201d Also while it is important to raise awareness, how helpful a concept is toxic masculinity in breaking the cycle of violence against women and is it demonising our little boys who are learning, listening and growing up right now? Some Instagram posts tagged around the topic range from \u201chow much of little terrorists sons can be when they are toddlers\u201c to \u201chow do we stop our boys becoming rapists\u201d! The moms discussing such topics - in my opinion - don\u2019t understand how damaging it is to reinforce such negative stereotypes of what boys are and can be. And in the rush to pile on boys and blame the men they \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb (post to be continued in comments)"

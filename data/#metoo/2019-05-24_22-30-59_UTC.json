                        "text": "I was 29 when I got pregnant, with a guy I really loved. I *could* have done it. After a messy decade, I had finally gotten myself on track and healed from the more painful programming of my Christian upbringing. I was just learning to treat myself with respect and compassion. My best friend was pregnant and I found myself fantasizing about when it would be \u2018my turn\u2019, though I knew I wasn\u2019t ready. I was sloppy with my energy though, and my body wanted it enough that I let it happen. \nMy boyfriend didn\u2019t want it though. With all these \u201cwhoops\u201d situations, my guess is that it\u2019s very rare that the responsible male is like \u201cNo problem! Let\u2019s do this! I\u2019ll take care of us and it\u2019ll be great!\u201d Anyways, I knew I didn\u2019t want to be a mom yet. Call me selfish, a murderer\u2026 I certainly felt that way. But to take a big picture look at everything, our biggest planetary problem is human over-population. AND I would have passed on all my issues; I hadn\u2019t done enough healing not to. I believe in the \u201cput your own life vest on first\u201d philosophy - If I were to be a mother, I\u2019d be better once I\u2019d built a more stable inner ground.\nI went to a doctor to get the pill, and discovered I was with twins. And I loved them with every fiber of my being, as pregnancy makes one do. I didn\u2019t shy away from it or disengage. Rather, I tried to love them a lifetime\u2019s worth of love since I\u2019d never get to meet the people they would have become. I went home and took the pill, lying on the floor I sobbed for hours. How could I kill my children? I wanted them more than anything, to love and hold them and make them better than me\u2026 but my decision had been made. When it was time, I had a ritual. It\u2019s not every day there\u2019s a portal to the Underworld within your own body. It took me months to emotionally recover, but I am grateful for the intensity of the experience and to shift my inner mama energies into trying to take better care of myself instead.\nI believe in the sacredness of women and I know so many women have had this kind of experience. It makes us all stronger, and it makes the world a better place to let women live the lives they need to live for themselves first, no matter what we were taught."

                        "text": "This morning, I discovered that my abuser is no longer a registered sex offender as recognized by the state of Pennsylvania. Meaning, that he is no longer required to register as a sexual predator. Essentially, he begins a normal life again. While I knew this day would eventually come, I\u2019m having a lot of difficulty processing the reality of the situation. His registration requirement was only supposed to be for ten years. And ten years have come and gone.\n\nI\u2019m feeling a tremendous sense of invalidation. I am scared. I am worried. To be honest, I feel physically ill. My heart aches for 15 year old Lauren. I wish that I could take her in my arms and protect her from this overwhelming sadness. I\u2019ve spent years coming to terms with the fact that my abuser didn\u2019t just make a mistake. That my assault was not just an error in his judgement. But that it was an act of violence. And today, I am reminded that someone that has inflicted this type of evil on another person \u2013 on a child \u2013 no longer has to answer to those crimes. His life begins again.\n\nI realize that my words are spotty. I may not be making much sense. But none of this makes sense to me. And I\u2019m not sure how to process my feelings in this exact moment. While I feel strong on most days \u2013 I do not on this day. But we keep moving forward. I keep moving forward. Because if I don\u2019t \u2013 then he really does get the final say. \u2665\ufe0f\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#sexualassault #sexualassaultsurvivor #endsexualassault #metoo #nomore #timesup #useyourvoice #healing #trauma #iamstrong #standwithsurvivors #breakthesilence #supportwomen #supporteachother #mytruth #speaktruth #vulnerability"

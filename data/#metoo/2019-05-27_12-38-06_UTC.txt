Let me know the meaning of pain. I've had my share I felt insane.  It's not that I'm dramatic. That my life has been quite traumatic. I've told my story when no one listen, until today. Then my friend tells me it's over there's no four leaf clover.  No happy story to tell, the hard work I did to care for you was all in vain. Here's  what I ponder to better a ruthless yonder. No teaches taught a lesson on the streets which I did live, through rugged surfaces I slept when nearby affluence places sat empty; while boats rock back and forth, the depreciation is it's sum worth.  Plenty story to be told but this would do for tonight. Good night and maybe see you again. #ntin0

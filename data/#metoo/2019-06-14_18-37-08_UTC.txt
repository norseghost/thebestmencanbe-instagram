|| SLOW DOWN||
.
.
The tendency to move, talk and think fast, to be occupied with multiple tasks, to always be on the go, and to be busy as a way of life, serves a purpose beyond productivity. .
.
Trauma physiology (a nervous system imprinted with trauma) drives us to move fast to protect us from having to feel whatâ€™s uncomfortable. .
.
Busyness can be a management strategy for getting through the day without having to feel into the unresolved trauma that lives in our bodies as pain, grief, anxiety, fear, and anger. .
.
We might also have the tendency to want to rush through our healing. To tell our story fast and get it over with because we think we should be healed by now! .
.
But moving fast keeps the trauma pattern in place. In order to shift the pattern, we have to do something different. We have to be willing to build our capacity to slow down. To come back into relationship with being and feeling, rather than doing, doing, doing. .
.
As an overachiever with a tendency to take on too much, and who feels like I should always be doing something productive, I deeply relate to this. .
.
Whatâ€™s your relationship with slow? .

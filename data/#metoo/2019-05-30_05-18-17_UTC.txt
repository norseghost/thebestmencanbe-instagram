Sometimes the emptiness surprises me. We all wonder what it's like to be "that woman" and we think we know "what we would do". I promise you do not. When you have been through a trauma, or sometimes years of trauma, your brain doesn't work quite right. Your body doesn't work quite right. Your emotions certainly don't work right, at all. You can't make decisions, you can't remember all that you need to do, and if you write a list you just stare at it because you don't have the energy to do anything on it. When we meet people and they ask the usual questions I feel like a fraud. I omit vital details because I've learned it either makes people uncomfortable or they do things like give us money which is massively embarrassing for me. So I fake it. I smile when I'm actually crashing inside. I've never been fake before, it's one more thing I've let him take from me. And so the empty creeps in. The circle of people I can be "real" with grows ever smaller. Because real right now is nasty business. And people can't be bothered. The world needs to know what this is like, because it's worse than any lifetime movie could ever portray. #chooselove

I am a survivor of my own war. Being a victim of Domestic Abuse is like being a prisoner of war. You are locked up, you are tortured, you are tricked, and you have to endure in order to survive long enough to escape because everyone near you has either turned against you or cut off from you by your captor. The difference is that you are held captive by someone you love and who says they love you too.

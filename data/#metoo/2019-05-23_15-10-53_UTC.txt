“Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you.”
‭‭James‬ ‭1:27‬ ‭  Fighting the fight of sex trafficking, I’ve been working with an organization that helps support survivors. I am an advocate that works in a safe house to help these girls better their lives and get to a space where they can be spectacular young women. Just like all of us they come with their own set of scars, they come with their rooms full of dark spaces and pain. I’m here to listen, to support, and be a light. I may have my own hardships, but not to the extremes these young girls faced. We are here on this earth to make change, to be light, and love the broken. So fight for what you believe in, love without trepidation, and fighting the world’s projection of not being able to make it! #youarestrong #enditmovement #sextraffickingawareness #sextrafficking #fightforwhatyoubelievein #metoo #writersofinstagram #christianwriter #christian #youareenough #strength #bethelight #bloomingintobeautiful #bloom

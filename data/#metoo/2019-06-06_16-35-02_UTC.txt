The origins of privilege⠀
⠀
Privilege as a social concept was first explored in relation to race by Theodore Allen, whereby his interest in the work of black writers and activism in the 1960s American civil rights movement led to an exploration of what he called “white-skin privilege” (Eddo-Lodge, 2017) .⠀
⠀
The concept was further developed by American feminist and anti-racism activist Peggy McIntosh in her 1988 paper White Privilege and Male Privilege. McIntosh writes: “As a white person, I realized I had been taught about racism as something that puts others at a disadvantage, but had been taught not to see one if its corollary aspects, white privilege, which puts me at an advantage”.⠀
⠀
In benefitting one person or group over another, privilege upholds inequality. McIntosh therefore asked people to “check your privilege” through 46 examples.⠀

The examples comprised statements for the reader – and for herself – to consider in order to determine what do I have (or benefit from) on a daily basis that I did not earn; that is, what is given to me. For example, “I can turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper and see people of my race widely and positively represented” or “I can take a job with an affirmative action employer without having my co-workers on the job suspect that I got it because of my race.”

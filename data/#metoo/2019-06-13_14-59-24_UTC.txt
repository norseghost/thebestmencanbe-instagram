DESCRIPTION OF FALLACY: When you appeal to something that is irrelevant, fabricated, or unsubstantiated in regards to the argument you are trying to make. Another way to think of it is when you assert a cause-effect relationship that probably does not exist, or at least you don’t provide evidence to show that it does.
.
So to demonstrate this fallacy through the spanking example (taken from Kimmel, 2018) — the person is at least implying that spanking is acceptable because they are okay; or at most they are asserting that spanking is what “caused” them to turn out okay when perhaps they turned out okay in spite of their being spanked. (This last statement by far has the most empirical support e.g. Gershoff, 2013).
.
EXAMPLES OF THIS FALLACY IN GENDER-RELATED CONVERSATIONS:
.
1. “I was hazed when I first joined this team and it’s harmless or “character building” so I’m going to haze you.” - In this type of argument they provide no support that it’s harmless, and they also use “character building” as a justification for its continuation.
. 
Here’s the thing, it very well might have been a character building experience for you because you developed resiliency skills in the process, but that doesn’t mean that because you overcame something other people need to go through the same experience. (IMO there are other ways to build character without humiliation as a necessary component).
.
2. “I know ______ to be a great guy” — I’ve seen this used in #metoo conversations to defend a male’s character. First of all, they rarely give reasons to support what they mean by their “great guy” claim, and secondly, it doesn’t logically follow that just because someone is a “great guy” doesn’t mean they aren’t capable of terrible things.
.
WHY WOULD SOMEONE USE THIS ARGUMENT?: Any time they want to bolster a claim without having to do the work to properly justify it, or without having to critique/change their previously held belief—thus maintaining the status quo.

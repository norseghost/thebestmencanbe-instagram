So these people! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Four of the Holy Cross Organ Scholars - and four of the five signatories (Brett Maguire in absentia) of the letter to Fr. Boroughs/Holy Cross. I can’t say how much I love and admire each of them each in their own unique ways. They are among my very best and most beloved friends and THE most admired artists and musicians I know. They teach me so much about so much. They are so special! It was amazing to get together and welcome Jeffrey Wood “Jeff” (and Jessica) back from Oregon! It was such a special, joyful, emotional, healing, time yesterday. I can’t tell you how much I love you all! 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️ #nomore #rainn #endrapeoncampus #1in6 #1in6men #nsvrc #believesurvivors #sexualassaultsurvivor #mentalabusesurvivor #sexualassault #sexualassaultoncampus #sexassault #itsonus #itsonuscampaign #humen #metoo #metoomovement #metoo❤️ #pathwaysforchange #nationalalliancetoendsexualviolence #notokay #theconsensualproject #theconsensualproject #iam1in4

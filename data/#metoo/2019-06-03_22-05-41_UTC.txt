No news channels opened today.
A far more palatable reality viewed on 4OD with series three of 'The Good Fight' - the razor-edged, spookily zeitgeisty show created by Michele and Robert King and Phil Alden Robinson (produced by Ridley Scott, and originally shown on CBS All Access).
Clothed as a law show - with Christine Baranski reprising her character from the splendid precursor 'The Good Wife' - this is an unmissable report from the thinly-fictionalised front-line of Trump's America.

Alt Right, race & sex & gender wars, #MeToo, NSA, NRA, NDAs, Russian Troll farms... dissected with nuance and intelligence. 
From the very first shot of series 1, the descent into a place very, very like the Place We Are Now has been told with daring and humour through a brilliant lens of familiar characters and guest cast (recently including Alan Alda and Michael Sheen).
Red, white and bruised blue - stars, stripes, black, white and all the greys in-between. 
This should be mandatory viewing - spinning all-too believeable yarns from the fraying threads available in a time of a barely plausible administration.

In another circumstance there was Paula Jones, Jones sued Clinton for allegedly exposing himself to her in a hotel room in 1991. The Jones suit, which went all the way to the Supreme Court, was ultimately dismissed by a judge on the grounds Jones could not show damages. While it was on appeal, Bill Clinton paid $850,000 to settle the suit without admitting liability. As we can tell by this, women are the ones that were silenced. Things like the #metoo movement gives young people, queer, trans, and disabled folks, Black women and girls, and all communities of color a voice. They want perpetrators to be held accountable and they want strategies implemented to sustain long term, systemic change. #WomenTakeCharge

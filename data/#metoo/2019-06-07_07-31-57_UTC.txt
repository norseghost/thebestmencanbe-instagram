United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 5 aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls 💪👩‍🏫🧕👩‍🚀🤱. .
While some forms of discrimination against women and girls are diminishing, gender inequality continues to hold women back and deprives them of basic rights and opportunities. ❌⚖️
.
According to the UN, one in five women and girls have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner with the last 12 months. .
Yet, 49 countries have no laws that specifically protect women from such violence.‼️
.
Empowering women requires addressing structural issues such as unfair social norms and attitudes as well as developing progressive legal frameworks that promote equality between women and men.✅
.
Let’s make progress together and fight for gender equality!💚💪

Oh what a night! Thanks to Eccentrich Richardson, Adriane Clarke, Jody Leshinsky and the Pompano Beach Cultural Center for inviting me to be a part of your Montage Film Series.  It was truly an honor and pleasure for me to share some of my work, story, the short film & art video installation - Caressed and the What‚Äôs Your elephant art movement. 
Thanks to Kay Renz and the team for all your hard work and efforts.  Thank you 
G Wright for your support in helping me to prepare for the evening and for the photos.  Thank you to Sheila Alexander & Grecia Garrett of FeminAfrika for the beautiful drumming intro - your musical gifts and divine feminine energy, as always - was an amazing touch to the evening!

Thanks to all who came out to support, listen, and ask questions.  I appreciate the hugs and affirming words and those who shared that they have been inspired to look at their own ‚Äòelephants‚Äô. Enjoy a few photos from the evening and PLEASE take the time to follow #WhatsYourElephant on Facebook, Instagram. (https://www.facebook.com/whatsyourelephant and https://www.instagram.com/whatsyourelephant) If you got something from last night - please help to share the work so others access it.  Stay tuned for upcoming ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs Your Elephant‚Äô talks, workshops, exhibitions and collaborations. 
With YOUR support this movement will grow and help to impact the world! üêòüé®

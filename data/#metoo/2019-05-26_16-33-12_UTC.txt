ðŸ‘‰ â€˜Ghostingâ€™ is the new term given for when a man just disappears out of nowhere... Youâ€™ve been on a few dates or messaging for a while, then suddenly he doesnâ€™t reply, you get no answer to your calls, heâ€™s blocked you on social media. Ghosted.

This can be pretty hurtful. When someone disappears from your life with no explanation your head fills with all the reasons why he may have left. ðŸ’­ I came on too strong
ðŸ’­ I put on a few pounds
ðŸ’­ Iâ€™m not funny enough
ðŸ’­ I should have made more of an effort

If a man wants to disappear with not even the decency of an explanation, that is not a man you should be worrying about. That is not a manâ€™s opinion you should give 2 seconds thought to.

Donâ€™t bring yourself down to that level. Remember, â€˜When they go low, we go highâ€™ ðŸ™Œ

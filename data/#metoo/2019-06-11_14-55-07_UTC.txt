‚≠êÔ∏è I love this episode so much. We talk about doing what needs to be done in ourselves so that we can avoid court (if possible), and even when things are contentious, she empowers us with ways to think so that we can encourage love and transformation in the most toxic of relationships. Gabrielle is honest and tells it like it is, she‚Äôs funny and she truly wants you to succeed. We talk about her book that is getting a lot of media attention, Better Apart, and the tenets which are the backbone of the book, as well as techniques to bring you back to a safe place when you‚Äôre overwhelmed, can‚Äôt sleep, can‚Äôt think and your anxiety is off the charts. We also get into parenting plans, what to look for in a lawyer and why forgiveness is everything. *

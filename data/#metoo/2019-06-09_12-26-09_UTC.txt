🤔Where’s all the 🙏🏽 for #sudan memes and conversations? I don’t hear any #metoo talks regarding the multiple reports of WOMEN & MEN being raped. Y’all are all fucking crickets. We can’t pick and choose what nor where #blacklivesmatter, or #genocide will forever be on #melanin lives. Our brothers and sisters need us to keep spreading the news now more than ever. I always say if the internet goes down how are we all going to connect? How many even have a local plan to connect with other organizers outside of modern technology? Crickets......... yep, we have to #educateandorganize and then we can properly begin to discuss an uprising the world has NEVER seen. In the meantime they continue to #cointelpro us, #poison our food supply, pollute our water supply, destroy our ozone layer as they create diseases widely spread through their #vaccinations, look around and the clear signs of #globalgenocide are available for the observant eye. 👁 This is what happens when the people are defenseless against government. Pay close attention to the similarities and then ask yourselves how can this be when the USA is supposed to a free nation full of liberty and justice for all? #clergy #whosinyourcircle #mentalhealth #revolution #peacefulprotest #murder #murderisnoaccident #freedomfighter #tyranny #guncontrol #humanrights #humanity #revolt #parenting #bksamirah

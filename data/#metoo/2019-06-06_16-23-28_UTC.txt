All these great movements like #bodypositive #selflove are telling women it’s ok to love our bodies - wahoo!

But is it?

How do we really feel about women who love their bodies? Who happily wear a crop top and hot pants with confidence? Who can list off all the things they like about their bodies? Women who are proud of their abs, curvy legs, arm muscles or perky boobs?

You know what I see. I see society not liking that at all. I see women who love their bodies being told that’s not right either.

Women apparently shouldn’t love ourselves TOO much. We shouldn’t shout about our positive points TOO much. We should always remain humble and not TOO confident.

I say be it all. If you’ve found happiness with your body and you’re proud of it, fabulous. You’ll always be TOO much for some people, and those aren’t your people ✌️ #lifeaswomenknow #yourestillagoodwomanif #loveyourself #selfconfidence #feminist #feminism #empowerment #empoweringwomen #loveyourbody #bodyconfidence #quotes #motivation #inspiration #metoo #girlpower #equality #selfcare #strongwomen

                        "text": "Part one of two-I\u2019ve always been hesitant to share the truly hard moments of my life. I don\u2019t want to trigger anyone or sound like I\u2019m complaining or looking for attention. But maybe by sharing mine I can encourage you to overcome yours.\n~\nIf you looked at my childhood it would seem pretty ideal, but in truth my younger years were riddled with sexual abuse, at first I was too young to even understand what was happening to me. I didn\u2019t get help until I was halfway through my teens & the trauma of it all had settled in deep. I\u2019m lucky to have a loving family that was good to me even when they didn\u2019t know what was happening, & once they found out they did everything possible to help me. I think my family, horses & nature are the only reasons I\u2019m alive today.\n~\nSometimes I wonder how much that trauma shaped me. Would I not deal with anxiety, maybe feel like I was pretty enough or not too damaged or emotional, or maybe I would just have a whole different set of issues if sexual abuse wasn\u2019t my first trauma it could have easily been something else.\n~\nLuna has offered me everyday healing since I first brought her home, she\u2019s given me a reason to go outside when I feel like I can\u2019t get out of bed & is always ready to cuddle or play. Mountains are healing, I\u2019ve summited Mt Rainier 4 times now & spent many solo nights in the backcountry. Whenever I don\u2019t feel capable of something I can remember how challenging some of those moments were & know I\u2019m much stronger than whatever is currently overwhelming me. Time helps too, years of gradual growth, understanding & distance to see that life goes on. Healing is a unique & patient process but I do believe it exists for everyone & every trauma. #metoo"

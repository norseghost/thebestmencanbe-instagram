                        "text": "Fighting Like A Girl and What It Taught Me (English)\n\nsolo dance by Lucy May Constantini, in collaboration with Ioan Hefin and Eleanor Shaw\ninvitation to a sharing of work in progress\nThursday, 27th June, 15:00\nStiwdio Stepni, Ffwrnes Theatre, Park Street, Llanelli SA15 3YE\n\nYou\u2019re warmly invited to see what we\u2019ve made so far, ask any questions and feedback on your experience. \nTickets are free, but please book to help us manage numbers. You can book on the link below or by phone or in person at Y Ffwrnes box office.\n\nhttps://carmarthenshiretheatres.ticketsolve.com/shows/873605008\n\nIn the era of #MeToo, what pushes a dancer with a long background in the supposedly peaceful art of yoga to invest years of effort and energy in the pursuit of martial arts? We\u2019ve been working with themes of gender and sexual/violence and asking:\n\nHow does our work with and through the body help us manage what is done to the body?\n\nLucy has been gathering movement material based on her long background in somatic practices, as well as more directly drawing on the South Indian martial art kal\u0323arippayar\u0331r\u0331, and the modern Japanese martial art, aikido. We\u2019ve combined this with text, marrying elements of autobiography with selections from the Dev\u012bm\u0101h\u0101tmya, the Sanskrit epic that established the Indian tradition of the warrior goddess, and weaving in responses in Welsh. We\u2019ve been exploring what it is to work multi-lingually, beyond literal meaning and translation, focussing on the sonic, rhythmic and emotional resonances of the different languages (four in all!) to see if this allows a connection for those of us who don\u2019t speak some of them.\n\nEverybody is welcome, but please be aware that some people may find some of the material distressing, and not consider it suitable for young children. Please get in touch if you\u2019ve got any questions or concerns.\n\nThis project is made possible by Research & Development funding from the Arts Council of Wales, and Theatrau Sir G\u00e2r.\n\nI look forward to seeing you there.\n\n#fightinglikeagirlandwhatittaughtme #theatrausirgar #ffwrnestheatre #dance #choreography #researchanddevelopment #martialarts #yoga #womenmartialartists #metoo #welshdance #artscouncilwal"

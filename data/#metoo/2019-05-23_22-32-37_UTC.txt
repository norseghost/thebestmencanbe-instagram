If I ever have a daughter I hope by then the world will be a safer place for women. I hope she will never have to worry about her skirt being “to short” or constantly hold her drink at bars. I hope she will never have to hear a cat call or be pressured into doing something she doesn’t want to do. I hope that she will never have to constantly look over her shoulder when walking at night or being grabbed at concerts. I hope one day this world will be a safety net for women and girls and not a constant danger zone. People make feminism look bad but to me it’s equality mentally, physically, and financially. I hope our voices shine brighter and stronger. And I hope if I do ever have a daughter she will never need to see the dark side of our current world. I hope the world respects her. I hope that the world will keep her safe just like she deserves.

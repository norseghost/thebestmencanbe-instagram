Lately I have been up to my eyebrows in all sorts of things - work, studies, wedding and a lot of things. You always say to me to be strong, because things will get better or we'll figure it out. I just want to say thank you to you Greg, thank you so much for being you. For accepting me in every way, making me happy when I am feeling so so down, and taking away all the pain I felt. Thank you for being there. Thank you for having so much love for me and never leaving my side. No one could ever break our bond. Only you can put a smile on my face and make the tears stop. You and only you make me happy, and I can’t say thank you enough. "Love you Greg"

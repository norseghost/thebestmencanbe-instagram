A wee interview straight after talking on the red dot at @tedx_glasgow yesterday. 
I have already heard from so many people who spoke to me in person or have sent me messages about the impact listening to my story had and how they connected with it on so many levels. 
I will continue to speak out to end the shame, stigma and silence surrounding sexual violence and to help others find their voice

On this day of independence, we are breaking diets. More than just a cheat day, today marks the freedom of eating— where we dismiss the fear of calories, show the world the joy of eating, and stand with confidence with our bodies. 
With self-assurance and determination, patronage in vegetables, as well as to demonstrate love for animals— regardless if beef, chicken, pork or seafood— we are all equal. True freedom is being #semi-vegetaraian. More than just a photograph, this is a stand in visible evidence of our diets. A call to #reignwithfitness, unnnecessary rejection of fatness, and breaking away from laziness, this is an earnest pledge to exercise 3 times a week, and to tolerate bland healthy food. 
I am Paula and this is my stand, my state of semi-vegetarianism.

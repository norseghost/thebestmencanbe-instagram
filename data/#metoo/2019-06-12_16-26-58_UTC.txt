The 1970s started off on a positive note, with the first rape crisis center being founded in 1971 by the Bay Area Women Against Rape. And by 1976, over 400 centers had opened across the nation. This made getting help much easier for women. Another big milestone was in 1975, when Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape was started. Like “The Feminine Mystique” in the 60s, another book was published in 1975, “Against our Will” by Susan Brownmiller (NCDSV). This book was said to spark more conversations on sexual violence, it drew much needed attention to the issue of rape. Arguably one of the most important things that happened in the decade was that Congress passed the Rape Control Act in 1975. This Act had a lot of preventative measure against rape, but it didn’t directly help women to get more justice, but it was still a big turning point for the nation. Lastly, in the late seventies and leading into the early eighties, “the United States experienced a tremendous increase in survivors of sexual violence publicly speaking out, sharing their stories of victimization” which was wonderful for the movement, to say the least (NCDSV). This really helped to draw attention to the issue. #metoo #metoomovement #1970s #rapeculture

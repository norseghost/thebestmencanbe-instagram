Monuments are intentional public spaces created to allow individuals and communities to express their gratitude and grief for the suffering of people, who most commonly have died in service to their country or people or as a result of oppression and injustice. There has never been a monument to survivors of sexual violence and abuse until The Monument Quilt. 
The Monument Quilt is a monument to survival, to the 3,000 phoenixes who have risen and healed from the trauma of sexual and intimate partner violence, and to the millions of survivors around the world who aren't in The Quilt. •

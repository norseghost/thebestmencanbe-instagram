I picked up TRUST EXERCISE by Susan Choi when I read a profile in @vulture that said, in part:
.
“It is the sort of page-turning metafiction that readers love to argue about — a Gen-X bildungsroman that speaks to younger generations, a Russian nesting doll of unreliable narrators, and a slippery #MeToo puzzle-box about the fallibility of memory. It’s also a paean to anger, arguably the defining emotion of our time, and after decades of tamping it down, Choi came by it honestly around the time Donald Trump got elected and she separated from her husband. ‘I’m conscious of having been so mad during so much of the writing of this book,’ she says. “Like really mad.’”
.
It was one of the “most anticipated” books of 2019 in every outlet and...it’s fucking crazy. In a good way. Speaking as an editor, if I had worked on this book it might have broken me—in terms of the narrative structure, she is GOING FOR IT. Whoa. And then you’ve got the story itself, which is smart and gripping and uncomfortable and so real you want to clean its scent off of you when you’re done. Absolutely masterful in so many ways. I will say that I wasn’t 100% satisfied by the ending, but that was partly because I wanted to know more about these wildly compelling characters—and the conceit of TRUST EXERCISE is that you can’t and never will know every side to every story. Fair enough! I’ll be thinking about this one for a long time...

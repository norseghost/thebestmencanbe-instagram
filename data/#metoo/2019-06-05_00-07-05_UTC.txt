Check out Class Magazines @classbarmag latest copy to hear our thoughts on sexual harassment in the industry and what’s being done to finally try and stop this once and for all.  Huge thank you for for he wonderful girls @monicasuh @amathus_claire  @hsharmancox @themisswhisky @victoriastewartpics that took part in this and @hamishssmith for listening to me as I got emotional and tried to explain what I wanted to do in swift one night . .

It’s a funny topic of conversation that most people don’t want to have.  For sure talking about the temperature of a martini is much easier topic for bartenders  however surely if we have a voice we should also use it for these sort of topics? It may not be Instagram feed friendly but it will make a difference. .

I know how lucky I am to work at @langham_london having a HR team and a supportive leadership team but not everyone has that.  Not everyone works in an environment where sexual harassment doesn’t happen.  Just look at the types of events where they just hire females and make them wear short skirts. This happens, it happens in a bar, at an event, in the back of a taxi.  I’ve been that person it happened to.  So have my friends. .

So slowly things can change, we can talk, we can raise awareness, we can make work places safe to work in. We can maybe represent people that don’t feel they have a voice.  We can make other people realise that this behaviour is not acceptable no matter who it comes from. .

So, like I said this topic may not be as Instagram friendly as the rejects of a rotavap distillation however its 2019 and this still happens.  Isn’t it time for a change? .

It’s not about having an opinion on everything,  it’s about standing for something when you walk into a room.

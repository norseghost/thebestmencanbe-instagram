ITS 3 WEEKS TODAY! GET YOUR TICKETS NOW.. Yay! Itâ€™s Friday and we want you to join us.

Finish work early or take the longest lunch break ever over at Victors Hale @victors_restaurants . Our networking events have no nets attached and there certainly isnâ€™t any working involved either.

Chatting, meeting open and friendly people and the odd bit of boogying is how we do things at Elle For Elle. 
We have fizz on arrival, special guest speaker, fresh food platters, raffle, raffle, raffle and fab tunes by our fave lady, @chickswithdecksuk . 
Grab your gals and grab a table pronto! ðŸ˜˜

All ticket sales go toward our mission of stocking up the bathrooms with body care, hair care and essentials for vulnerable women and girls living in UK refuges.

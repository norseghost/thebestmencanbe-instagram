Friendships: Some of my most treasured friendships begin in arts and advocacy and continue.... in art and advocacy.
.
Michelle and I met via #VDayBakersfield many years ago (swipe left to see a photo from our first time socializing at a VDay Cast get together in... 2009? 2010? Can’t remember?) and we’ve supported each other through health problems, life challenges, death of loved ones, kids growing up and moving away, lots of shared experiences on stages and more.
.
This photo was taken at Samuel’s graduation last week which Michelle attended because we show up for each other. We’ve become family.
.
We’re still supporting each other, unconditionally, making the world a better place by taking a stand for what’s right. .
Because that’s what friends who become family do. .
Thank you, Michelle, for being such a treasured, inspirational friend. .

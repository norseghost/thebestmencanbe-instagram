♂✳︎♅ | Mars sextile Uranus

In our season of movement and blossoming, a special planetary interaction finds traction today. Guarding over the waters and womb of the feminine, Mars in Cancer finds a powerful friend in collective-minded Uranus. In Taurus, he’s currently shaking up, dissenting, and pushing into revolution for the masses around the matter of earth and our material lives.

Sparks fly as they join forces and Gemini Season helps us to gather and disperse information. It’s a bold day to give effort, energy, action, and collaboration toward the big resistances that need our voice: #metoo, keeping families together at the boarders, #blacklivesmatter, stopping the attack on women’s bodies and rights, environmentalism, and plenty more. @fams2gether and @aclu_nationwide are two places I like giving to.

In more personal territory, how do you need to start thinking differently about what you’ve valued (or not valued) about yourself and how can you breakup with not thinking that your voice matters? What passion and clarity is your intuition claiming that can help you shake out of any ruts in material stagnation or newly push into around nurturing the boldness of your feminine side—the ability and right to nurture, multitask, birth or not birth, act with communal priorities, understand the cyclical nature of our actions, the eternity and magic of holding earth and bodies as sacred?

Rise up today, Muses. Do it for yourself so you can join the masses doing it for the world and the future of life on this planet.

I actually have objects that I compulsively keep that are related to my traumatic events; it is more like the proof that the events happen that I take out and observe on occasion and then I put them away and sometimes it helps, giving myself permission to remember, isolated moments to recall and sometimes it helps, storing the memories inside objects... Though, there are still other objects or things that trigger me without my previous awareness of their capabilities... ---Hannnah... #ptsd #specialobjects #actuallyautistic #metoo #autismacceptance #autismawareness #autism #sexualtrauma #trauma #triggers

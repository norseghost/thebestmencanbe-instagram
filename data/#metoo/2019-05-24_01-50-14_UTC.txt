It took me a while to realize what we had actually lost. We didn't just lose our husband/father. We lost our protector, our income source, the future we had dreamed of, and our home, knowing where we would sleep every night and where our next meal was coming from. We lost everything but our dogs and the clothes on our backs. People think it should be easy to leave a bad situation, but always there is more to the story. Understand that they may be tired of telling their story and that after a whole it feels like whining. It is important to get the truth out there though to help end the taboo that surrounds domestic violence. Just make sure you ask to learn, and not to hear juicy gossip âœŒ #chooselove

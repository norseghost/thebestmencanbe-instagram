We have a crisis of epic proportions on our hands. Women across the globe are being killed at alarming rates. Even young children are being attacked and raped. It has to stop. This violence has to stop.
All women and girls deserve to be safe no matter where they live. UN Women is working hard in over 100 countries across the globe to put a stop to violence before it starts. But we are only as strong as the supporters behind us. The women and girls of the world need your support.

- FT. LAUDERDALE

Come out on Saturday, June 8th to hear my story of how sexual child abuse played a major role in my struggles with homosexuality and how God was able to set me free. I hope my story will give you hope and empower you to speak up about abuse that may have happened in your life, so you can grow from being a victim to victorious.

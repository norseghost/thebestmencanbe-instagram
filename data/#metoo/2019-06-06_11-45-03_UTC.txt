Have you ever said 'yes' to something you didn't want to do or knew was a bad idea from the start only to drive yourself deeper and deeper into a big mess? 
In my most recent counselling session, we talked about how I have a really hard time saying 'no' to people because I worry about the consequences. Even if I feel like there could be consequences for saying yes, more often than not I'll still say yes if it means the person I'm saying yes to is happy

Well, last night I got myself all worked up because I felt like I'd backed myself into a corner due to saying yes to something that made me uncomfortable. It was completely my fault for getting myself into the mess I was in so I figured I'd just have to suck it up and go ahead with it

Thankfully, this morning I shook a bit of sense into myself and politely corrected the 'yes' to a 'no' and I feel so much better for it

If you were walking into the woods one night and you saw monsters peering out at you from behind the trees, you wouldn't think: "well, I'm in the woods now and I've gotten myself into this mess so I'll keep walking deeper into it even if it means being eaten alive" You'd run back in the direction you came from and get the fuck out of there

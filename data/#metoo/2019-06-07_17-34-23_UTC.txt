#whyididntreport - I was shocked, confused, ashamed. I couldn’t admit to myself what had happened. Instead, I buried the truth and just kept moving. I worked double shifts 6-7 days a week. I isolated. I shattered. 
But the world around me continued on unchanged.

I dreamed of going to the police one day and finally getting justice. Years later, I talked to friends that had reported and, for them, going to the police was just another nightmare.

üí¨ We Need To Talk About Rape Culture üí¨‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
What happened at Warwick University is disgusting, abhorrent and shameful. Those girls should have been protected at all costs, instead WU chose to protect itself and leave the girls exposed. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
They let their Press Officer conduct the investigation, he released a statement to the media with intimate details of the girls in. He also decided the punishments for the perpetrators, the conclusions of his investigation being published to the media instead of privately being disclosed to the girls, they don't know who got which punishment.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
The university didn't acknowledge what they let happen to these girls, not a single apology was issued. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
These stories are not uncommon across the UK and America, thousands of women in Universities and colleges are victims of Rape Culture. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Schools, universities and employers need to tackle Rape Culture and admit that they have a responsibility to the victims who attend their establishments or work for them. ‚Å£‚Å£
This has to stop. 'Lad Chat' culture HAS TO STOP.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
If you are part of a 'lads chat' and you talk about women in a derogatory way, talk about wanting to rape them or perform other non-consensual sexual acts or acts of violence on them, I advise you to leave that chat and educate your friends on what it means to be a decent human being. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
We will not take this anymore, we are standing up and being heard because TIME IS UP!‚Å£

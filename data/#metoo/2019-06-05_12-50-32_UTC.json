The pain I hid. I would be judged. So I numbed it all. I hid anything vulnerable.\n\nThe thing with that is, to feel is to be vulnerable.\n\nAnd by not being prepared to show my most authentic self, by seeing my vulnerability as a weakness, I was saying no to my emotions, to my feelings\u2026.I was saying no to being me.\n\nThe moment my life changed was the moment I decided to open up and begin to tell my story.\n\nThe moment I began to show the real me.\n\nEvery single part.\n\nBecause the truth is, through all the masks and the bullshit\u2026 if you don\u2019t like the person you are when you lay down at night\u2026\n.\nWhen you are alone\u2026\n.\nWhen your mask has been removed\u2026\n.\nThen what\u2019s the point.\n.\nIt starts with you, so strip it all back, show all of you, your most authentic self because that\u2019s what\u2019s beautiful.\n\nNo mask, no pretending.\n\nThat\u2019s what the world needs.\n\nBecause that\u2019s enough\u2026\n.\nYou my darling, are enough!"

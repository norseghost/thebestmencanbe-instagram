I started this project a few months ago for this event called Take Back The Night. The purpose of the event is to bring awareness to sexual assualt and stand up against it and rape culture. First off I was grateful for this opportunity to use my photography to participate in something meaningful, and I would also like to thank everyone one who reached out to help and everyone that participated. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Sexually assualt not only against women, but men and trans people is a big issue in our community. I hope this encourages you to go out and take a stand. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Historic moment for Nia Franklin (Miss America 2019), Cheslie Kryst (2019 Miss USA), and Kaliegh Garris (2019 Miss Teen USA). They are trailblazers, creating their own path on their own terms. 💪🏿👑✊🏿

The attention comes as this country increasingly rethinks long-held gender norms, spurred on by the #MeToo movement. Did you know that pageants have recently sought to put more emphasis on the offstage lives of the women and girls, highlighting their accomplishments and charity work, instead of only their appearances? It’s about time! 😳🧠💁🏽‍♀️

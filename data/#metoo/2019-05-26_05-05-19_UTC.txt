just typed a big long thing only for Instagram to say "nah" and glitch out when I go to add tags, lol.

but I'm just gonna say this: if you're a product of one of these circumstances then you're not less worthy of anything. the point is: we want the humans that are actually ALIVE and able to feel the effects of r*pe, incest, or anything else to be able to heal quicker from their trauma. a pregnancy conceived from r*pe or incest often causes deeper wounds, as it's a constant reminder of what happened. it's another way for the r*pist to hold control over the woman, and that's not okay.

thank you for coming to my tedtalk

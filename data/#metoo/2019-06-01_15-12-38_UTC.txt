Reality of how C-PTSD manifests:
I'm a little hesitant to post this because of the vulnerability that is to follow and the potential for people to comment something rude but, I want to share this because it may help someone else feel less alone. So, last night was a rough night regarding my trauma. I had flashbacks and body memories. When I was finally able to get to sleep I woke up a short time later having wet the bed due to the severity of my nightmare that was saturated with so much of my trauma. C-PTSD is pretty scary to live with at times. Sometimes my guard is up really high and then other times it's more relaxed. When I have incidents like this my guard goes back up and I become hypervigilant until my brain gets a signal that it's ok to relax-- that I'm not going to be hurt. These are only memories and while they suck, they can't hurt me anymore.
Today, I'm just going to focus on self-care to get my brain to chill out and remind myself that it's ok to not be ok.ðŸŒ» #cptsd #sexualabusesurvivor #traumasurvivor #metoo

I had a really amazing weekend. I even let myself go with the flow and not plan everything. It ended with a photoshoot with my amazing photographer and friend Dorie. We almost cancelled because it was looking like rain but decided to go for it. We got shots when the rain started and then ducked under an overhang when it absolutely poured. Then the sun came out and there was the gorgeousness of wet sidewalks and NYC after getting washed clean. I snapped this photo on my walk back to the subway because I didn’t always feel this beautiful. I didn’t always love myself as much as I do now. Sometimes this feeling makes me want to dim my light a little to make room for others. So they don’t feel worse because I feel so confident and am taking up so much space in the room. I’m not going to do that anymore. I can hold space for everyone around me to feel this incredible too. Do me a favor today and go on over to Dorie’s incredible project @meandeve . She shot me for this project what feels like forever ago and that share made me courageous enough to share my #metoo story on the cover of @usatoday in 2018. That cover and that visibility has helped me open up even further. Many days are challenging, sure, but I know I am headed in the best possible direction. #selflove #selfcare #light #shineyourlight #love #loveyourself #latergram

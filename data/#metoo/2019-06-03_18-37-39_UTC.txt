Whatever we spend the most time consuming or focusing on is what will most shape our character. This is true about everything in our lives:  from the music we listen to and the things we watch, to the people we spend time with and allow to influence us. You may have been “living up” to people’s negative expectations of you, or to a lie about who you are. If this is the case, now is the time to break free from that lie and begin to live as the whole, pure and healthy person you were created to be. This may require you to move away from certain relationships, behaviors and even places you spent much of your time. As you move away from those lies about your identity, you will be able to start new and rewarding relationships and connections that will allow you to be yourself and be accepted for who you really are. #notjustahashtagpodcast

God doesn’t throw away his handiwork and start from scratch. Instead he uses the same canvas to repair and make more beautiful the painting that was marred by the vandal. The vandal doesn’t get the satisfaction of destroying his rivals‘s masterpiece. On the contrary, God makes an even greater masterpiece out of what his enemy sought to destroy. #gaitsofhoperanch  #connect #heal #grow #jesusshowusyourtruth #spreadtheloveofjesus #metoo #equineassistedlearning #equineassistedtherapy #horseshealinghumans #ptsd #anxiety #grace #horsetherapy #trauma #woundedhealer #equineassistedpsychotherapy #southgeorgia #valdosta #horsetherapygeorgia #equinetherapygeorgia #butgod #newcreationinchrist #warveteran #moodyairforcebase #activeduty #milatary #suicideawareness #equinetherapy #firstresponders

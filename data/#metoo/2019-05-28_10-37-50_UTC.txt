We miss our church! My baby girl (6yo) drew this and told me that it was the hands at each corner for the church protecting! I couldn’t help but wonder the significance but then again there are things that do not have to be explained as Holy Spirit works in many ways! 🙏 #discoverychurchcolorado #dcc #holyspirit #metoo

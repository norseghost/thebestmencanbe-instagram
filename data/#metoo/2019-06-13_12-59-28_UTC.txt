Dear IG Followers,

Definition of a Doll; a small model of a human figure, typically one of a baby or girl. ü§î Maybe the #metoo movement and #timesup came and went. Maybe it‚Äôs not #objectifying to #women

We live in a world where so many people are accepting of what they see and read. It seems so many are easily swayed by the way some #celebrities #influencers and the #kardashians communicate. 
Maybe it‚Äôs meant to be #alluring or #sexy. It could be said it‚Äôs #cultural or it‚Äôs just #kitchy not to be offensive.

Maybe it started as just a cool #marketingstrategy by men in suits on a #whiteboard in the #warroom in an attempt to #empower women to spend more money on #plasticsurgery in the pursuit of looking like a beautiful doll.

I ‚ù§Ô∏è the #aesthetic industry. Helping  others look and feel their best is amazing and rewarding in countless way. I have great respect for the #plasticsurgeons who care deeply about their #patients and who focus on #safety #service and #outcomes 
I don‚Äôt consider myself a #feministactivist however I can‚Äôt help but notice that it seems odd that it would be okay to refer to female plastic surgery patients as dolls. 
What message are we sending as #mothers and #fathers to our #daughters and to our #sons. Are we okay with referring to women as dolls?

I will always be a raving fan of #cosmeticsurgery and truly believe that most of us who work in this industry are in it for the right reasons and have a true understanding of what it can do positively for quality of life. I also think that we as industry professionals have to draw the line on what we consider acceptable and start holding our colleagues to a higher standard of integrity. 
If you disagree, I‚Äôm not offended. Unfollow, keep scrolling, whatever-I‚Äôm one opinion in a world of 7 billion. If you agree with me than take a step to separate yourself from what takes away from all that‚Äôs good in the aesthetic industry. If we all agree to be #leaders not #followers we can get back to what‚Äôs good. 
Sincerely, Michelle Emmick @theplasticsurgerycoach

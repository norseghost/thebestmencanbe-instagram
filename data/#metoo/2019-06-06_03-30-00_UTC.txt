A broken man can break others, but a healed man can help heal the world! The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that 60% of African-American women have or will have experienced some form of sexual assault or abuse by their 18th birthday! Sixty percent! Let that really sink in. Healing has to start taking place on both sides of the equation. Women who are victimized must have safe spaces to heal and men must begin to address and heal their trauma so that they can stop perpetuating abuse... In this Truth Be Told episode, my co-host Dina Black and I speak with one man who has done just that. Leon R.Walker, Victim Advocate, Speaker and Author sat down with us for 2 hours to discuss his journey of being sexually abused as a child, how that led to him becoming a womanizer, why he finally decided to face his trauma and heal and how healing and taking ownership for his behavior changed his life and his relationships. We also discuss his new book entitled “Broken” available on Amazon.

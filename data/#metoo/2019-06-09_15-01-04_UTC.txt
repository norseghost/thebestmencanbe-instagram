I must say that I’m thrilled with the reception of Heroines of Avalon and Other Tales. Gold & Silver with COVR Visionary Awards. Gold with IPPY. Overall Fiction Winner with Indie Reader Discovery Awards. Silver with Nautilus - and more literary awards!!! This is a clear sign that the voice of the feminine - of Mother Earth and those who wish to dream with her - wants to be heard!!! It has been described as THE #MeToo movement book, for it is about giving the voices back to the Heroines who were silenced and almost forgotten. When you read these stories also remember your story... for we all share the same Earth. We can hold hands and dream a New Earth into being... Reading a poem from this book, ”Song of the Grail Maiden” during the Artemis journal launch and ballet on Friday reminded me that art is mean to be alive and onstage. Art, dance, literature & music fills our souls.

Let’s keep sharing our wild spirited tales. And thank you to everyone who has helped Heroines of Avalon become a success. The Old Woman of the World is smiling! #metoomovement #metoomovementbook #awardwinningauthor #literaryadventure #ayncatessullivan #heroinesofavalon #inats2019 #covrvisionaryawards #ippy2019 #independentbookseller #culturalcreatives #artemisjournal #awardwinningbook #nautilusbookaward #indiereaderdiscoveryawards #motherearth #motherearthlove #superheroines #grail-champions #dindraine #arianrhod #blodeuwedd #iouga #elenoftheways #ladyofthelake #avalon #goddessstories #celticwomen

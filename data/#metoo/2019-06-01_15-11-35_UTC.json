You and I are worth encouraging!\n\u2022\nLet\u2019s be our own best friend and start by stopping the negativity that so quickly can devour our minds.\n\u2022\nOther times I\u2019m a great encourager of \u201cothers\u201d outside of my own home. The ones I love and live with and see up close, can get the raw end of the deal.\n\u2022\nIn getting caught up in saying, \u201cno, stop, don\u2019t do that, do this, clean that up, hurry, let\u2019s go,\u201d and on and on, I can forget to stop and speak the words of affirmation and life over them that they need to hear. You?\n\u2022\n\u201cAll the water in the world won\u2019t sink a ship until it gets inside. If you allow the atmosphere in your home to become negative, it will begin to decay from within.\u201d - @jentezen from his book The Amazing Discernment of Women\n\u2022\nWe can all act like this never happens in our homes or we can just admit that we all have a little room to improve. I know I do!\n\u2022\nI don\u2019t want to be that woman, that wife, that kind of mom and yet, sometimes I am. Sometimes I mess up and repeat the problem over and over again, instead of focusing on finding a solution.\n\u2022\nI want to be a problem solver, not a problem repeater.\n\u2022\nThe woman I so often long to be is not always the woman I am.\n\u2022\nAnd yet, if I had someone following me around and pointing out what I need to do different all of the time, I would probably be ready to \u201ctake that person out\u201d.\n\u2022\nThis thought strikes my heart deep as sometimes I am that person to my children and husband.\n\u2022\nSometimes I am that person to myself too.\n\u2022\nGod shows you and I so much grace and love and He calls out the greatness in us far before we often exemplify greatness.\n\u2022\nThis is what I desire to be like.\n\u2022\nSomeone who calls out the greatness in those closest to me, as well as others outside of my home, no matter what I see happening.\n\u2022\n\u201cPeople have a way of becoming what you encourage them to be, not what you nag them to be.\u201d \u2014 @jentezen\n\u2022\n#faithcaffeinedevotion #speaklife #speakaffirmations #thinkonwhatisgood #encourageyourself #encourageothers #metoo #thewomaniwanttobe #gentlenudge #challenge"

Earlier this week, Jack Straw and Justice for Lai Dai Han delivered a letter to 10 Downing Street to ask for the UK government to support an independent UN-led investigation into sexual violence during the Vietnam War.

This comes after an open letter was sent to President Moon Jae-in, on behalf of the Vietnamese women who were raped by South Korean soldiers during the Vietnam War and the tens of thousands of children, known as the “Lai Dai Han,” who were born as a result of sexual assaults committed by South Korean soldiers during this period of conflict.

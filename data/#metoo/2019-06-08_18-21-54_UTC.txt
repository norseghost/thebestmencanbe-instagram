Today, the 2019 COPE-SEPB National Convention was honoured to have Tarana Burke as our Keynote Speaker! She is a civil rights activist and founder of the Me Too movement. She shared her experiences as an activist and truly embodied this year's theme: Inspired to Action. She inspires me to act and to keep moving forward, always fighting! 
Here are some of her key points: *There is more work to do because the #MeToo movement is not enough by itself. It is just one solution to the problem. *We need to change the system. We need people on the ground and in the streets. *Community Healing is crucial. *We deserve protection. We deserve safety. *This movement is not just a women's movement. It is a survivor's movement because men <and other gendered people> are survivors in this movement too. *Consent matters any time you may enter someone else's personal space. *When someone asks "How do we exist in a post #MeToo world," she would ask "How could you live in this world before the movement?" *We come to the work because we are moved by the work. *Have courage, even just to fail and try again. *People who say that enough is enough do so because they are uncomfortable with the conversation. Be uncomfortable, but shut up. We won't stop. 
Thank you, @taranajaneen for sharing such a moving piece at our convention! You are a strong and amazing person!

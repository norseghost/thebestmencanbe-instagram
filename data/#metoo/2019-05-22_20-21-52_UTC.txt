I am happy to be on the 10th episode of @abravenewmanpod to discuss the complex issue of Sexual Consent in the Post #MeToo World. It is available to listen to NOW on Apple Podcasts!

Summary below ~~~~~ How do you define sexual consent? Given the fact that we all come from different backgrounds with different pasts, it is impossible to guess whether or not a new sexual partner fully consents to sexual situations without having that conversation with them. It is important to be fully aware and present with our sexual partners in order to know whether they are fully consenting to our sexual encounters with them. In this episode we explore what consent actually is, and how we can deepen our relationships to others and ourselves in order to have healthier lives both sexually and otherwise.

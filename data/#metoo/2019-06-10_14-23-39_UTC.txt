Setting up for week 2 at @nyagallery .... trying to make my time this month in the artist booth  as meaningful and powerful as possible. Continuing in my theme of self identity I wanted to address how important it is to restructure sexuality. I have mentioned before that I often want to express my femininity with pride but end up feeling inferior to Men when doing so. Sex historically controls women; from the fear of sexual power, religion and sin, and most of all the shame surrounding women and their sexuality... we must be able to function with full access to our spirituality... start breaking down these stigmas for yourself in your own way. •

Rape culture is a myth, and not on some Stephen Crowder “change my mind” stupid shit, it effectively is just a buzzword that just does nothing towards what it hopes to solve (Rape that happens in the U.S and the lack of people coming out to report them) rather those believe that society ACTUALLY supports rape and has little empathy for the victims. Which I think highlights problem with elites who are accused of rape and nothing happens prior to the #metoo movement. People who aren’t a part of the elite Hollywood class lives are ruined at even a mere accusation , we don’t have a rape culture in America we have an elitist culture

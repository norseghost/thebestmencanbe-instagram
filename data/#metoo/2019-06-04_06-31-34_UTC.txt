Me time mum time 
Everyone needs down time, even if it’s in the smallest of doses. Especially after half term! 
Your time away from the kids is YOURS. Own it.
You deserve a break every day. And by “break,” I mean time just for yourself. Call it “me time” or “alone time” or “everyone get out of my face time.” Whatever you want to call it, you damn well better be taking it.

"There are seven areas that an abuser needs to address to demonstrate repentance (at a minimum)... 1.) They need to be able to respect othersâ€™ independence and individual autonomy; 2.) They need to accept full and unqualified responsibility for their own actions and feelings, while having an empathetic acceptance of the emotional and relational consequences of their behavior; 3.) They need to learn to live in truth and be able to doubt their own perceptions; 4.) They need to be able to relinquish forever any perceived right to control anyone, either by coercion or by manipulation; 5.) They need to commit to a life of sacrificial service, especially to those they have harmed (that may mean permanently staying away and not communicating at all); 6.) They need to give up any expectation that they can reverse the damage done, but they need to repair and restore whatever is possible; 7.) They need to give up any expectation that they will ever get any positive return on these actions and be willing to keep doing them anyway." https://www.patreon.com/posts/for-repentant-22409892

Last day vibes for Long Lost Sister by director @lisafrance2067 and produced by @cartelhqdotcom ! With one film wrapped, I'm going straight into another one shooting in Marfa, TX with producer @starlamichelle1 . Then with any luck in our crowdfunding campaign, we will be shooting @brick_house_film in late June/early July. If you haven't checked out our indiegogo page yet, please do. Every little bit counts! $20 or even $5 makes a difference. Thank you a million times to everyone who has supported us so far. I can't wait to make you all proud.

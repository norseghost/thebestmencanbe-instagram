New Podcast Episode!!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ We recap our experience from @women_deliver 2019 â€” link in bio. 
The episode is packed with content ranging from the future of work to #MeToo to the power of movements and everything in between. We also chat with three other East Coasters -- Ashley Hall, @allisonthorne and @richardrrachel about their experience at Women Deliver.

The Women Deliver 2019 Conference took place from 3-6 June 2019 in Vancouver, Canada and was the worldâ€™s largest conference on gender equality and the health, rights, and wellbeing of girls and women in the 21st century. 
I attended Women Deliver as a @womendelivermobilization bursary recipient. Mobilization Canada brought together around 50 advocates from across Canada to participate in Women Deliver. 
Femme Wonk is also one of the many mobilizers from across the country working to continue the momentum of Women Deliver. You can check out the other mobilizers including events at wedeliver2019.org.

How will you use your power?

Some think June 4th marks the anniversary of “women” getting the right to vote. In fact, today marks the anniversary of White women’s suffrage movement. Some facts:
•

1. White feminism has a long history on these shores that goes back to the 1640s and 1690s of British Caribbean and Virginia where the first race laws were primarily anti-miscegenation statutes seeking to protect “English and other white women.” The invention of Whiteness is very much an origin story of protecting White women through/by patriarchy. •

2. In the same decade in which White feminism became a constitutional right and empowerment, chapters of the KKK were specifically opened for and managed by White women. •

3. For this reason, from its origins to today, when White women speak for the category of “women” or “all women” we kkknow they mean White women. And the archives of #simonedebeauvoir and #AnneSexton and #SylviaPlath and sadly even #AdrienneRich bear out this same invisibility, as well as the “mainstream” (White middle-class non-trans able-bodied) #MeToo movement.

Credit to @bruce_wayne11 : Jupiter In #SCORPIO♏

Jupiter entered #SCORPIO♏ in October of 2017.  It was either the same day or the day after the Harry Weinstein scandal broke leading to the whole #metoo movement.  Yes, #SCORPIO♏ rules sex, things hidden, things too taboo or forbidden to discuss openly...but it also rules death and transformation. .
.
 #SCORPIO♏ also rules people hungry for power and money (not this post, I'm on a Trump diet) People have been killing themselves but in recent years the statistics have gone up.  Jupiter rules expansion,  seeks the truth and is the general ruler of justice.
.
.
The recent suicides of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain within days of each other have shined some light on a very serious issue related to mental health and addiction (remember transiting Neptune is still in #PISCES♓..rules drugs, addiction, mental health) Jupiter transitng #SCORPIO♏ was bound to dig up ugly truths that have been swept under the rug...and we are totally in a different climate because of it. .
.
Jupiter in #SCORPIO♏ isn't all bad, it's about growth and expansion through transformation.  Last fall, I had no intention to launch a new site, 5 months into 2018 it came to me it needed to done.  Looked at my natal and forgot that transiting Jupiter is in my 2nd House, and transiting Pluto is square my natal Jupiter...expansion through growth and change. .
.
All these events we are experiencing all a part of a bigger plan for us individually and collectively.  Jupiter in #SCORPIO♏ is a big reminder of how precious life is and as bad as it may sound...that nothing lasts forever. .

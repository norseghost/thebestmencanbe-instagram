This post is late, and it\u2019s long, but here goes\u2026\n.\nGetting a book published feels like a huge success, but it came after FIVE YEARS of setbacks and disappointments and self doubt. When I first began attending #SCBWI conferences and shopping the story around with agents and editors, some were encouraging and some were meh but everyone said, \u201cyou won\u2019t get it published.\u201d Parents were the buyers of MG books, and what parent wanted their kid to read about a 12-year-old girl getting groped on the bus? .\nOctober 2016: The Access Hollywood story broke, with someone bragging that he like to \"Grab [women] by the pussy.\u201d On Twitter, @KellyOxford asked women to tweet about their first assaults, and literally millions responded. Suddenly every parent of a 12-year-old needed to talk about groping and #MeToo... .\n\nOf course my manuscript wasn\u2019t ready to send out because I\u2019d received other feedback that I needed to address. But nine months later, I was finally ready. I combed through my stacks of #SCBWI conference notes and polished my query letter, and reached out to seven agents\u2026\n.\n.\nand realized, after I\u2019d sent ALL the emails, that there was a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad error in my 10-sentence query. I had effectively blown up my best seven bridges to publishing.\n.\n.\nTo make myself feel better, I went back through the list of agents I\u2019d bumped up against, and found ONE name I hadn\u2019t sent the TANGVB query to. So I sent a query off to @agentsaba\u2026\n.\nshe requested the full manuscript a week later, and offered me representation a week after that, plus said glowing things about my book and my characters. And six months after that I had a contract with #HarperCollins. \nI will never forget the the shock I felt when I opened Saba\u2019s email asking for the full. Or my complete disbelief when Saba told me that an actual publisher was interested. But I will also never forget that I worked really, really hard and stuck to what I believed in and told a story that I felt was honest and never gave up. \n#mglit #bookstagram #middlegradebooks #middlegrade #harpercollinschildrens #harperkids #amwriting #authorlife"

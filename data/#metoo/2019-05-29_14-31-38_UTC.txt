Take advantage of speaking to an advocate through a hotline ☎️ You can remain anonymous and just talk if that’s all you’re ready for. Sometimes the first step to leaving is simply talking to someone who is trained and deals with these types of situations daily. You won’t have to feel ashamed or judged. They are dedicating their time to hear from you and offer you any help/support you may need 🧡Remember, the moment you feel heard is the moment your healing will begin. Speak up, even if your voice shakes

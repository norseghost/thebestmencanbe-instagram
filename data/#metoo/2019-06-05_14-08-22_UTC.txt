Velvet @hulltruck tonight Tom has always dreamt of being a successful actor, and now after years of disappointment he is finally presented with his golden opportunity... and an impossible decision to make. 
Set against the backdrop of the 2017 #MeToo movement, VELVET explores the complex realities of harassment within the industry and how far a person is willing to go to achieve their dreams. However, when most creatives are riding the wave of change, will Tom's opportunity slip through his fingers? #lgbtqðŸŒˆ #gay

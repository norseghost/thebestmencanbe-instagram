spending an overcast Saturday @landmarkcinemas, where #kanata has a totally renovated lobby, complete with self-serve...everything üçø, and the ability to reserve your recliner seats at no cost! The movie üé• #ma on the other hand was underwhelming, with a little too much shock value added in a desperate attempt to live up to a storyline that mixes the enlightening new genre of black horror with exploitative #metoo vengefulness. Have you seen it? Want to? Hell no? Haven‚Äôt heard of it? Thoughts???

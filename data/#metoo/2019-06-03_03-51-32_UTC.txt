How it felt...
.
.
.
Like a leaf falling down the tree, like not belonging anymore, leaving all behind because they do not understand. How could they?
They don't understand how he's gaze penetrated your soul, how it drained you, how it dried you with his words, with his touch.

It didn't happend much though, and I could have let it go as we usually do at any stranger's flirty attitude, nasty words follow by a laugh with his friends.
We usually just look away, walk faster and forget because well...(sh)it happens. 
But he made me feel intimidated, sad, afraid... And for the first time I didn't walk away. I spoke, WE spoke and it was clear to me. No is NO, and there shall be cero tolerance to any harrasment attitude because it is not about being abused... It all starts with one gaze, one word, one touch

And hey, I flourished again, stronger, confident and beautiful

Not everyone will understand how it feels and I hope from the bottom of my heart that they never will

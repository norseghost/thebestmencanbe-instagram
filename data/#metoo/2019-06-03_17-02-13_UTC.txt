Even if you canâ€™t tell your story, we hear you, we believe you. ðŸ’œ Remember, not everyone is able to disclose stories about the abuse they have been through. While it is incredibly brave to share ones story, itâ€™s not safe for everyone. Even if you canâ€™t tell your story, your trauma is still real; not sharing it doesnâ€™t invalidate it. If you canâ€™t disclose publicly, remember there are still people who believe you, and who honor your truth. *

# Repost from @ the.holistic.psychologist ... The single thg holding people back and keeping them stuck is their thoughts.

Actually, it’s their relationship to their thoughts. We believe we ARE our thoughts.

We’ve been thinking the same thoughts since childhood. This creates neural pathways in the brain. The pathways in the brain cause us to repetitively think the same thoughts over and over again. Every single day.

These thoughts create emotion. The thought “I’m never good enough” creates a physiological response within the body. The body becomes dependent on the neurotransmitters released from the emotions.

This is how we become emotionally addicted and subconsciously seek situations where the body can get this emotional response.

We all have intrusive thoughts. They are past experiences that we continue to re-living in our minds. Because we don’t teach the skill of finding the present moment, we become a slave to the mind. It wanders endlessly in thought and we respond to those thoughts as if they are true. This state of unconsciousness is the cause of so much suffering and we label as mental illness.

Consciousness is the path to healing intrusive thoughts. Becoming conscious allows you to be who you truly are: the awareness who can witness thoughts. When we become present we can question thoughts. Questioning thoughts changes the emotional response. It allows us to make a choice instead of what we typically do: habitually react beyond awareness.

Screen shot this exercise. Practice it every day. Commit to it. With time you’ll change the pathways of your brain and teach yourself new emotional responses #selfhealers #intrusivethoughts #survivor #metoo #brainretraining #limbicsystemretraining #retrainthebrain #retrainingthebrain #neuroplasticity

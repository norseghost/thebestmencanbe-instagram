                        "text": ":\n:\n\u201cIt is a classic case of rich man\u2019s justice,\u201d said Boies. Add the fact that wealthy predators often target victims in financial need. That was allegedly Epstein\u2019s M.O. as he sent recruiters into working-class neighborhoods in search of teenagers to give him \u201cmassages.\u201d The rich exploit the poverty of their victims to extract promises of silence \u2014 backed by the force of law because the NDAs are binding contracts.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is a simple change to the law, Boies contends: \u201cSimply say that agreements to conceal evidence of a crime are not enforceable.\u201d The Epstein case is particularly creepy but not unique. The #MeToo movement has revealed the pernicious misuse of NDAs to enable crime. Powerful men such as producer Harvey Weinstein and television executive Leslie Moonves reportedly made use of the agreements to hide evidence of sexual assault or harassment. This secrecy in turn allowed offenders to target additional victims.\n:\nThat\u2019s where the public interest comes in. Crime is not just a matter between an offender and a victim; crime is also an offense against the public order. The public has an important stake in punishing past crimes and preventing future offenses. Purchased secrecy interferes with those aims.\n\nSome attorneys say NDAs are the only protection the rich and famous have against unfounded accusations. But that doesn\u2019t bear much scrutiny. A person who might falsely claim to be a victim has more to fear from sunlight than from secrecy. And anyone who pays hush money to cover up false allegations is only encouraging more extortion.\n\nI am beginning to worry that the fresh breeze of openness that appeared to be blowing through the stink of the Epstein case might be smothered by secrecy. Attorneys for Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach accusers are losing confidence that their clients will ever tell their stories in court."

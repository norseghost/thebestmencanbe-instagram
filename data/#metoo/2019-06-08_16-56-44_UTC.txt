Iâ€™m heartbroken.Another day, another violent sexual attack in Pakistan of a minor. I will not show the videos or images of little Jamna right after the attack that are being circulated on social media. What is wrong with people? 
Also, there are calls for the death penalty and public hangings of the rapists. Capital punishment is not the answer. It has not thwarted or reduced the level of sexual offences, rape and assaults of women, girls and children in Pakistan.In a culture of social patriarchal constructs, male toxicity and gender apartheid, where men and boys are taught that women are cattle, property, commodities, objects and garbage to be tossed after â€˜useâ€™, why are we surprised and shocked when such heinous attacks occur that are beyond human understanding. This is a specific male problem of sexism, misogyny and chauvinism. This is where a new programme of a re-education of Pakistani society needs to begin, where men and boys are retaught about respect, gender equality and the value of human life. 
Enough is enough.....ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

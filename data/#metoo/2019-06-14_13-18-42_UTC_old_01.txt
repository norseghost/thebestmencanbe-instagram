Sharing posts and changing profile pictures feels like such a small and insignificant thing to do, yet many people aren’t even aware of the tragedies that have been and are occurring in #sudan. 💔 I’m posting to raise awareness. 💙 I’m posting to show that these people matter, are loved from afar, that our hearts break with them because we are all one. 💙 That feels so empty to say while I am sitting safe and so far away. Take the time to educate yourself on the #sudanrevolts , from news sources and search hashtags #sudanuprising #sudanmassacre #sudanese_love ❤️Consider reposting stories to spread the word, instead of your #yoga poses, #selfie , #foodporn or whatever. Don’t let these people feel forgotten and less loved than a building. 💙 Let’s use social media for good! 💙 And for anyone closer and with more knowledge that sees this repost, please share what else we can do! #sudanforever 💙🙏🏼💙

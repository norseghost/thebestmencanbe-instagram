All That is Lovely in Men, Robert Creeley, illustrations by Dan Rice, edition of 200, signed, Biltmore Press, Asheville, 1955. Creeley, a good friend of Charles Olsen, was part of the Black Mountain poets and Black Mountain College, an experimental communal college in North Carolina. He was called, with some distain by Robert Graves, a domestic poet, part of a group breaking with history and tradition as their primary poetic sources, giving instead primary importance to the ongoing experiences of an individual’s life. I haven’t looked at this book for a long time - it’s quite a beautiful read. And the title grabbed me this morning, thinking about my son in this era of #metoo and #timesup, both causes which I believe passionately in, but also am hoping for young men to find the best within themselves as we all move forward #poetry #blackmountaincollege

And one day she discovered that she was fierce, and strong, and full of fire, and that not even she could hold herself back because her passion burned brighter than her fears.

I've been working on my health a lot lately. Like a LOT. I snuggle baby goats every morning, laugh my heart out every chance I get, make sure to get my workout in every day, eat amazing fresh local foods, work on my body positivity, and journal (when I can remember to ðŸ™ˆ). Of course I spend aaaaaaalllll day with my kiddos, but taking care of myself is seriously the most important. If we're constantly pouring from our cup, without filling ourselves up, how the heck will we have anything left to give?

I'm working on filling my cup so full, that it overflows to everyone around me. To my children, my family, friends, and community. But I need to fill MYSELF up first. Damn that's a hard concept when you're a natural giver. But if I keep remembering that by doing these things for myself, that it is the BEST way to be able to give MORE to others, I know I an accept that I must focus on me first.

So ladies and gents, fill YOUR cup up today. Breathe in fresh air, meditate, hug the ones you love, compliment yourself in the mirror, and believe in your dreams. Chase those sunrises, find gratitude in the little things.

We've only got this one life.
Let's live it WIDE.

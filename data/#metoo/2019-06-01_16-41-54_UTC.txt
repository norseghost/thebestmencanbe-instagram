Consent has been a particularly hot topic in the wake of the #MeToo movement, so we’d like to break it down for ya real quick. You may be wondering: Is it okay to have sex with your long-term partner whenever you want? Does saying “Yes!” to sex with someone once mean you’re saying yes to sex with them forever?

In this episode of Sex Education with Jada, you’ll learn about the importance of consent in long-term, committed relationships and why asking before touching your partner is super sexy.

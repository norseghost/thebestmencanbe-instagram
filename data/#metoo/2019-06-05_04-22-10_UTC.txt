How early does victim shaming start? Parents of Journey School beware, this could happen to your child. Our Daughter has been hit in the face, spit on, pushed and intimidated by a boy at her school over and over, and SHE was kicked out of school. Do you know the full truth about what is happening to your child and what the school is actually doing about it? Lux and her other class mates have been subjected to very disturbing violent threats and language from two other students and I witnessed it first hand Friday morning. I walked Into class and a child was leaning over another saying “I’ll shoot you in the face! I’ll kill you! You’ll be dead!” This went back and forth over and over. We confronted the school about everything that has been happening and what the actual plan was to turn it around, they were very upset we alerted other parents of the very violent dialogue happening in the class in front of all of our children (never divulging any names of the kiddos involved) and they have turned it around on us, that we were unreasonably upset, we were being too confrontational with the school about the lack of transparency and lack of answers from the staff and head of the school. We became the focus for telling the truth and letting parents know what exactly was happening in the class when they wouldn’t. This could be your child. They only respond when doing damage control. In one email they even insinuated me or my child were lying about one instance of her being hit because neither teacher saw it....#victimshaming #bullying #bullyinginschools #womensrights #metoo #timeisup #momlife #dadlife #childhoodunplugged @austinmomsblog @kvuenews @fox7austin @nationalnow #keepourchildrensafe #gunviolence #believewomen #believechildren #safeschools #antibullying #stopbullying #atx #atxschools #austin #austinmom @rosemcgowan #truth #thetruthwillsetyoufree #saveourchildren #childrenarethefuture #drippingsprings #laketravis #reggioemiliaapproach #reggioclassroom #mamabear #protectourkids

Amidst increasing digital technology presence, there is now rising concerns over the use of digital spyware being used to track and harass victims of domestic violence. Lawmakers are now being urged to start charging people for using stalkerware to harass their partners.
. ◼Tips to protect yourself if you are faced with this situation: .
▪A stalker needs physical access to your mobile device and its password to install an app, so change the password regularly. .
▪If you suspect a stalkerware app has been installed on your phone, removing it or trying to shut it down could aggravate your stalker and put you in more danger. Instead, take the phone to their service provider to check for suspicious applications and to get a new device if necessary. .
▪Use an up-to-date iOS operating system regularly as stalkerware cannot be installed on devices that are updated.

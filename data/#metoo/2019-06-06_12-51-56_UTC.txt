*TRIGGER WARNING*
(Delhi, India)
“Last year, around this time, I’d gone to Bahrain to meet my dad who lives there. He was playing badminton, so my mom and I decided to get some shopping done. We went to a shop that was right around the corner – I was looking through a few clothes, while my mom was in the trial room. This shopkeeper came up to me and started asking me what my waist size was. I told him that if I needed help, I’d ask for it. But he kept pressuring me to get a measurement done. He took out a tape and began to take my waist size, but when he started to touch my chest, I immediately withdrew. He suddenly came close to me and grabbed me from behind. I’d gone numb and couldn’t even bring myself to call out to my mom. I just wanted to run away from there. That’s when my mom came out. I was in shock – but the minute I got my bearings, I went to my dad and told him everything. He immediately ran to the shop, grabbed that man by the collar and started hitting him. In no time, the police arrived and we were taken to the police station. There, several rounds of interrogation were conducted – the same questions were asked again and again. It was a very uncomfortable experience – but I sat through it because I wanted justice. The next day, we were taken to court, where the man was convicted as guilty and put behind bars. The world needs to understand that no one has the right to touch any human, without their consent. And those who cannot comprehend something as simple as this, deserve to be tried to the fullest extent of the law. I may have been a victim in that moment, but the fact that I raised my voice and fought, makes me a survivor. Someone who can never be suppressed, or kept quiet.”

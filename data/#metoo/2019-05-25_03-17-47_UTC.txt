Still trying to learn and accept this. So much of my narrative has been about putting the shame on me (where it doesn’t belong). Trying to place the shame where it belongs is easier said than done. I’m constantly wondering if I’ll ever get there. Some days I both live and understand this quote while other times I feel as though I’ve betrayed people. However, breaking your own silence or disclosing hard information to save another is never correlated with betrayal. It may feel like it, but it’s just a feeling. It will never be the truth ✊🏾 #edrecovery #eatingdisorderrecovery #anarecovery #anorexia #anorexiarecovery #edfam #edfamily #edwarrior #prorecovery #edsoldier #recoveryisworthit #beatana #strongnotskinny #childhoodtrauma #survivor #trauma #complextrauma #metoo #metoomovement

At 10 years old we begin to lose our self-confidence!  How sad!! We then spend our 30s, 40s, and 50s trying to build it back up again!  If we can take the time now to take care of ourselves and un-do the messages we’ve received over the years, we will be able to be more content with ourselves and our lives.  For those who have daughters, by taking care of us we can be positive role models to them on self-love, self-compassion, and following our dreams.  Let’s break this cycle! 💖

If you’d like to learn how for either you or your daughter, schedule a complimentary call with me by messaging me or clicking on the link in my bio ▶️ @denisestyer

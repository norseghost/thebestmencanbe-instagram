Screenshot of the most recent Reverbnation music chart for R&B/Soul. I guess this is what they call going up the charts "with a bullet". To have started two weeks ago in the 300s nationally and the 400s globally, and now this in just days?! In the 20s in BOTH categories?! I've never been here before! And the most exciting part is that my positive message of respecting musicianship, not being confined by so-called musical genres, respecting women, respecting one's self, having integrity, and encouraging women to be their own producer is getting out there! #womenproducers #respect #music #detroitmusician #musicvideo #reverbnation #detroitfilmmakers #positivevibes #MeToo #timesup #timesupnow

Id like to call this one “Let go, Let OUT” You know when you feel like you just cant speak up. When you want to just tell someone what they NEED to hear. When you must defend someone as a bystander. When you want to scream out because youve held off opening your mouth for so long! When you are too afraid that by you speaking out you feel youre in the wrong... but youre actually not. Just LET Go, Let Out.

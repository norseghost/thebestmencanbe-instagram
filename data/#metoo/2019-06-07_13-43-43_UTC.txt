Another bus, another country...kind of. I've been in Kosovo since Tuesday afternoon. Busing from Prishtina to Prizren for the run tomorrow morning. 
3 countries in a row is starting to take its toll on my body and mind. I'm shattered and feeling the intensity of war traumas, no support for rape survivors and the struggle to survive in a world where so many people still don't have basic human rights ðŸ˜•
More news tomorrow from the run - country 48 ðŸ™Œ

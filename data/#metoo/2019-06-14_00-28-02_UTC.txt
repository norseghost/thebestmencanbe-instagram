Actor #CubaGoodingJr entered a "not guilty" plea on Thursday to two charges: forcible touching and sexual abuse in the third degree.

Gooding entered the New York City courtroom in handcuffs around 6:47 p.m. with a smile on his face. According to reports, when the arraignment started, heÂ approached judgeÂ Jacob Moses andÂ never said a word.

The judge read the charges and Gooding Jr.'s defense attorneys -- Mark Heller, Elizabeth Heller andÂ Peter ToumbekisÂ -- entered the plea and asked for the process to be expedited. || ğŸ“½ via ABC News || Follow @hamptonblunetwork

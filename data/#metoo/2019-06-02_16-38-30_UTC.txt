Enjoyed a 💡meaty convo yesterday with a business client turned long time friend & he suddenly opened up in all new ways. In the process of that, we discussed how ✨vital it is for each of us to take charge of our growth & healing (since, of course, no one else can do that for us!), and he got into repeated 🔥points of ✔️ emphasis about how men do not understand the way women think & see things. He was shining the spotlight there with regard to relationships he says he has had in which he 🎈became frustrated because of some communication breakdowns; and, this also led us to talk about the many - both subtle & not so subtle - 🗝negative messages that are all over (social, news, entertainment & every kind of media) telling women we are not enough - or are too much - & will only be accepted or loved if we fit one particular mold. The de-programming from this can take a woman years to rise from (or decades), simply because such messages are also engrained & reinforced through families, schools, politics, churches and almost every other implied aspect of mainstream authority. There is a new “ad” circulating ☯️ now, however, from one of the powerful Williams sisters (tennis) by @nike that talks about being ‘crazy’ in terms of owning personal #power and capabilities...thereby turning all of the lowered ceiling false limitations on their heads in extraordinary - and very timely - ways. We have seen some men aiming to control women’s bodies, choices, minds, income, and self-esteem in every possible way; and, this is exacerbated each time a #MeToo type of movement or forward stride sees light and has success. Insecurity & fear is an ugly monster, but one that knows how 💥powerless it really is against the truth. Here’s to all of the evolved men and women who are striving to make these past realities antiquated relics...things we will soon look back on and shake our heads in disbelief. Each time we celebrate our worth in healthy ways, we spread light and love. How are we each doing more of that - for ourselves & others - today and this week? #LV8 #consciousness #light #love #EVOLution #now #trust 🕉

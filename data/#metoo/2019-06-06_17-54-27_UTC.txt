I performed a new poem at ‘The Noise’ in Brum recently! Here’s a part of it, a letter I wrote to my 17 year old self. 
Thanks for having me @lifelikelydia , total pleasure!! ❤️ My next performance of this piece will be this Tuesday, 11th June, at ‘Oooh Beehive’, held at the Beehive Pub in Swindon 🐝 hosted by the lovely @osemanclive and Nick Lovell 😆

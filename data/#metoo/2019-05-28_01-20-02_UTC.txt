Sally Field’s acting career holds a special place in my childhood memories for her role as the mother in the movie “Mrs.Doubtfire”. Along with Mary Poppins, this was my favourite movie that I watched quite frequently with my nana. She would always call me if she ever noticed it playing on the t.v. and we would watch together on the phone. 
This past fall I stumbled upon Sally’s biography “In Pieces” and quickly fell in love with the woman instead of her character role. She delves into her experience about being in unhealthy relationships, growing up with an on-and-off again father, a supportive, yet, distant mother, a strong and independent grandmother, a dysfunctional and sexually abusive step-father, the many times she has encountered sexual harassment, and her life-long struggle with mental health. Sally advocates for female rights through her involvement as a board of director of “Vital Voices Global Partnership”, an international Women’s NGO. I highly recommend reading her biography and experiencing her bravery in telling her story for yourself. Sally describes the shame she felt for not defending herself while in harmful situations as “I despised this stuttering, anxious person now sinking into the shabby love seat, loathed her sadness and fumbling inability, which made me sick to my stomach. It never occurred to me then that it might be their behaviour that made me want to retch, not my own”. #womensupportwomen #femaleempowerment #metoo #scrunchies #hairaccessories #getitgirl #strongwomen

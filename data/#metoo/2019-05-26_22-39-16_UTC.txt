Today is Mercy Mooâ€™s 5th Birthday. She is the sweetest baby girl, but with big attitude, spoiled rotten, and boy does she love Walker to pieces. She was Graceâ€™s first and only litter of puppers. Shew wee what a stressful day that was!! She was the first born of 4, 3 girls and a boy. Now we have a little Grace and Mercy with us all the time ðŸ’œ

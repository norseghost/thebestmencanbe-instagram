I am so tired of the hate and intolerance. The bigots who can't tell left from right, but want to control women's bodies, hate on the LGBTQIA+ community and spew ignorance towards Non Black People of Color and Black and Indigenous People of Color. While they so often point to God.
You know what, stay away from the internet then, since it's only here because of Alan Turing - an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist who happened to be atheist and gay. How about them apples.

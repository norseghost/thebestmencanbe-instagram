This is what happens when your a woman who doesn’t give attention to men on Instagram. Right away it goes from “damn momma, let me buy you dinner” —> “hey woman, let me show you how to do your job.” Meanwhile feminism is because of lesbians and the #metoo campaign just a bunch of girls wanting attention. How about we learn to be respectable humans and treat ALL people with the fullness of our self-removed hearts. But hey, let’s not get carried away with our expectations from a modern society that has immigrants risking their life’s to join. Oh Maria and her fantasies...🧜🏼‍♀️🧝🏼‍♀️🧚🏼‍♀️🧞‍♀️

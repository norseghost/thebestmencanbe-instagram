“So if you 2 @senwarren 💕 & @ocasio2018 💕👏👏💪💪💋💋are going to run as the next US President and Vice President nominees  of the United States of America🗽🇺🇸 who is going to be @berniesanders ‘ 💕💕👏👏💪💪💋💋Vice President?🤔. I hope  you all succeed in neutralizing the rotten pro status quo leadership in the US Democratic Party and its decaying DNC and its conservative DCCC (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) Because the hierarchy structure of the US Democratic Party is very similar to the Pro Soviet Ex-East European parties that were always involved in repressing the members and the representatives if they were against maintaining status quo, that Youth Democrats presently suffer from such as Lobbying for the Apartheid State of Israel and AIPAC, NRA and big corporates, forgetting all  Human Rights issues and Women’s Rights that need to be dealt with urgently.”R.F.

Time to read those receipts 🧾🍵 When companies like Toys R’ Us & Sears go down & lay off thousands of workers and steal their promised severance pay, people think it’s “internet kills brick + mortar.”
.
That’s not the full story.
.
CEOs+boards load these co’s w/ debt to enrich themselves, tank them, & leave workers in the cold w/o promised severance.
.
If that’s not bad enough, it looks like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin did exactly this with his old college roommate (literally) - he served went on the Sears board as his roomie served as CEO.
.
Together, they fired a *quarter million people* in a debt scheme that looks awfully self-dealing.
.
We want to get to the bottom of it. 🧾

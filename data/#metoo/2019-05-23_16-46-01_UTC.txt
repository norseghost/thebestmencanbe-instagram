I thought about being famous since I was little One day I'd have my own book, I'd be on stages all over the world and I'd change people's lives! ⠀
⠀
As years went by the dream felt a little less sure, a bit more silly. The pipedream of a little girl. ⠀
⠀
It's interesting how our subconscious hold on to those things for us and if you really hold on to a dream long enough your mind will find a way to make it happen.⠀
⠀
 Now I have a book. I speak from stages and I impact thousands with my message, even if it looks a little different than it might have when I was a young girl. ⠀
⠀
You don't have to let go of your dreams because something shifts and something happens you just have to have the power to reclaim them. ⠀

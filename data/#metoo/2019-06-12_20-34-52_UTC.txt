Forgiveness is given, trust is earned. 
I believed that forgiveness was a good and noble thing and did my best to be a generally forgiving person.  However, I did not understand that because I forgave someone did not mean that I had to continue to be in relationship with them.  Looking back on the way I dealt with hurt in relationships, forgiveness translated to: “I will stuff the pain I feel about what you did so we can resume our relationship.  I am afraid of losing you, so I will rush to ‘put the past behind us’ and hope for the best, meanwhile, putting my heart at risk again.” In reality, many of the people that I was dealing with were not safe people.  They had not earned my trust, in fact, they had broken it.  Now, I understand that forgiveness does not equal reconciliation.  And reconciliation without recovery or genuine efforts to change can be dangerous.

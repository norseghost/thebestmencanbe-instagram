Wow @officialduffmckagan!
I know you don't much read social media comments, but this song...man! I had to share my feelings on what I just listened to.
I don't know if you truly get how much those lyrics give voice to those of us that up until recently, weren't being heard, never got justice, never quite got past that pain, shame, guilt, silence, humiliation. 
I want to thank you for this, for speaking out, for getting us & for helping to give us our voices back.

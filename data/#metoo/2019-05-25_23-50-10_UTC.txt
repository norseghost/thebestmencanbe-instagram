From the wonderful illustrator @hannahbelle.michelle It’s not just hearing the words, it’s feeling the disdain in someone’s voice when they tell you you’re ‘too feminist’. It’s watching someone laugh at you when you try to explain toxic masculinity. It’s worse when it’s someone you love. I don’t pretend to have all the answers but I’m not going to ignore something that’s right in front of me. I’ve been in too many rooms where I didn’t feel safe speaking my mind. I’ve been in too many situations where I thought silence was better than making someone feel uncomfortable. I’m not going to put aside someone’s feelings and worth because you’re uncomfortable. There are too many people out there that feel alone and I just want them to know that I believe in them and their voice. I won’t shut up if you won’t. •

Posted @withrepost • @hannahbelle.michelle “I have a lot of things but one thing that I have never been able to shake is when I was in israel I was staying with other people from Penn state and these 2 boys who I was living with told me “my feminism was making people uncomfortable” I have never felt more oppressed in that moment because I feel like that defines me and these boys telling me that I make people uncomfortable just made me so angry but I knew I couldn’t react with anger because that would just make it worse. And because of that, they would never believe me when I talked about a cat calling or creepy guy that approached me in israel. Because I’m “too feminist”. What does that even mean?” - Amanda @mands417

I am choosing healthy living as I learn to dodge the people who gaslight me in my home state.•
•
I am determined to stay safe and adapt as needed for my ability to support Abbie and I.•

So for those that do still choose to bully me, have you ever thought, there is a new way of living and maybe, just maybe it is time you stop picking me a part and focus on your own health/safety goals instead of mine? Do you think the social bullies/attackers in my community will ever be strong enough to just leave me be so I can find peace and stability for once in my life?•

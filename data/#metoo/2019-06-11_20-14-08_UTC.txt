~Just girl things~ 
Learning  to scream before I could sing to scare off any man who dared to touch the likes of my body. 
Being told I’m somebody’s in stead of somebody. 
Accepting that women’s bodies will always sexualised by uncles and cousins fathers and brothers grandads and boys on streets. 
Hearing rape jokes daily,
Hearing me too daily, 
Hearing stories on Facebook of women being raped daily, 
Being told to stay safe daily, 
Being told, I got out lucky as if didn’t wonder what it would be like to shed of the the parts of my body that you touched.

If you are not angry you are accepting. You are accepting the sexual assaults that happen in the streets we used to play in as kids. You are accepting the misogyny that runs in men’s blood. You are accepting their greed like they aren’t already privileged enough, “why isn’t there an international men’s day.” Why isn’t there equal pay? Why do have to text my girl friends to see if they got home safe? Why do we receive pictures of your dicks on our phones like it’s some sort of sick surprise party?

If you are not angry you are settling. You are settling for the secretary position instead of becoming the CEO of the fucking company. When you hear the locker room talk in the break room don’t settle for lunch at your desk. Pour vodka into the fire and say something, anything, but don’t settle. 
This is not to fuel a fire of hatred towards the other sex. 
This is not to spread misandry. 
This is to tell all my sisters out their to never settle and to never accept that we are anything less than capable.

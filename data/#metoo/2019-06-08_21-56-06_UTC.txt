Geneva 2006. Behind the tomatoes fence, there was a place where I could be safe. I will always remember the first time I discovered my Geneva apartment aka “the Happy Place”. The light, the wood floor, chimney, terrace & charming old bathroom tiles. I entered my fairy tale. I entered a new chapter in my life. I entered a rebirth. #safe #peace #rebirth #grow #metoo #newbeginnings #tomato #fence #lomography

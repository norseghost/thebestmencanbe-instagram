Learning how relove every inch of your body after an assault can feel like a minefield.  While you may disconnect, it's important to remember your body is the vessel which carries your soul and while you need mending, your body is still yours and you should love it again!  One of my favourite ways to love myself is to write all of the things I love about my body.  Even the things I didn't love before, I find a way to love it. What are some things you love about your body?

An Indonesian film about a gang-rape victim is looking to shed light on the trauma that survivors of sexual violence go through, and makers of the film say they hope it will encourage the government to pass the Bill on sexual violence. '27 Steps of May' illustrates the trauma and healing of the lead character May, who was gang-raped at 14. The film explores the alienation not only experienced by her, but also her father, who feels guilty about failing to protect her.

#QueerSuperPower // Power, 
Of raising, emancipation, empowerment, reappropriation, 
Of our bodies, our skins, our sexualities, our stories, our identities,…
Faced with what is defined as the norm.
It is a total possession and with no concessions, 
of our essences, our representations, our feelings, of the emerging self
of our anchorage as being.

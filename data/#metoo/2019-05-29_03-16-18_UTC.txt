Each time I re-stock my personal stash of #ptsfeminist books for pop up shops & online orders, I donate one to a survivor in need or a feminist organization/collective that directly supports vulnerable populations. This week, a donated copy went to @morethanno ’s upcoming Cabaret Con-sensual fundraiser for their first Survivor Retreat. 💗

If you want to sponsor one of these donated copies, now you can. There’s an updated “Buy One/Give One” listing in my shop for this, but you can also reach out to me personally to sponsor if you don’t want a copy for yourself. 💕

Hawaii Arts Community Forum:
Cultivating Safe Practices in Our Creative Spaces

We gather to engage in open and honest conversation to discuss ways to make our Hawaii Art Spaces safer for all involved.  Representatives from the Sex Abuse Treatment Center and other community leaders will be included in the forum.  We hope that this is a first step towards healing, reformation, and a supported arts community.

Building our futures take commitment to vision.  Today I woke up like this because it’s imperative to take a pregnant pause to increase and recognize the transformation happening within.  With this in mind, I woke up like this and a sign of new beginnings.  Leaving behind the things that compromise my wholeness will be eliminated in order for growth to happen.  In addition to increasing and basking in the growth of my other surviving thriving sisters who have accepted their badass selves with a goal to reach our own personal higher power to help another. .
I woke up like this.  Period.  The vision continues and thanks to the army of sister soldiers who are ready to fight for the change we want to see.  #salute ..

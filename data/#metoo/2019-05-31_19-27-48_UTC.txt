NYC - @taranajaneen Birthday Party - September 2018 (Somehow I found myself at a party with my camera and it ended up being a birthday celebration for Tarana Burke, the woman who founded the #metoo movement! It was such a pleasure getting to spend my night with such an amazing group of humans ðŸ’œ )

Feels hopeless like something that's not going away. I am anxiety. That's a scary thought, and scary thoughts will cause you more stress and anxiety. Your heavy load is getting heavier.\n.\n\ud83c\udf31REPLACE\nInstead of anxiety. Replace with. I am experiencing anxiety, this is my stress response, I am not my stress response, this is a mind & body reaction to stress in my mind & or body. There is a cause, I can learn ways to calm this down, allow myself to do this, remove self doubt by trusting & trying. My stress response will know there's no danger because I'm showing it, & my thoughts are more helpful, less unknown. Then when i feel calmer my mind will feel more able I can then look & investigate what is causing stress & take actions to reduce the cause, reduce the anxiety.\n.\n\ud83c\udf31REWORD \nPut the heavy load down labelled, 'I have anxiety, I own it I cant put it down. \nIt's fear, you're unknowingly holding on to fear & that's the main ingredient in anxiety. \nIt's not your fault, there is alot of information out there of how anxiety feels & with scary images, we're getting the wrong idea about it. \nDon't get me wrong experiencing panic, gad & agoraphobia was the most scariest time of my life. It felt horrific! But thinking of it as a dark cloud, a monster, an uninvited murderer etc 'Anxiety ahhhhhhhhh run away' didn t help me it made everything worse.100\u00d7 worse.\nIt's not a monster, it is my best mate. it's a response to stress in my mind, body or both, it's a helpful sign the cause is too much for my health mentally or physically & its time to investigate, get info from my doctor, talk, release emotion, look at areas of my life for causes. Etc.\n.\n\ud83c\udf31Not you. Not faulty. Look for cause."

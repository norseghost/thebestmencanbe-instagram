Birth control doesn’t work 100% of the time and medications can override them— some of those same medications can cause birth defects that wouldn’t necessarily be visible until the baby is here. Other babies can be born with dependency issues. Some people in real relationships sometimes STILL choose to abort because of their lifestyle and maintaining what they have rather than winding up financially strapped. I would know. #YouKnowMe I’m NOT proud of my decision and it eats at me every single day, but I know in MY heart that MY decision for MY body was based on MY current situation and MY disbelief because I WAS TAKING MY BIRTH CONTROL. MY decision was HARD, but I have 2 children who are accustomed to their lifestyle. I have to take Adderall for my ADHD and got pregnant literally 3 months after taking it while going to school full time. I was anxious and drinking my sorrows away, I was SKINNY, there’s no evidence on humans as to how amphetamines effect a fetus because doctors don’t even want to risk harming the baby, but on rabbits— NOT GOOD. So MY decision was to do what was best for my third child and myself. A blessing he was, but he was also a surprise that surprised me and my MD. I don’t like telling people this outside of my circle but this is MY cross to bear and a sin that *I* alone will answer for. Not to you or anyone else but GOD. #MeToo #WomensRights #CivilRights #HumanRights #UndergroundRailroad2019 #SignalBoost #BanAbortionBan  #Abortion #AbortionRights #EmpowerWomen #EmpoweringWomen #HerBodyHerChoice #FamilyTrip #ProChoice #Roe #RoeVWade #Alabama #AlabamaAbortionBan #PlannedParenthood

This story makes me sick. ⠀
⠀
A 3-year-old name Noah McAdams was recently forced by the courts to undergo chemotherapy and then was taken away from his loving parents who were seeking alternative care and placed into custody by the state. ⠀
⠀
They’re calling it an act of “medical kidnapping”. ⠀
⠀
The fact that anyone would be forced to undergo toxic chemotherapy treatments is outrageous. Even worse is the fact that this child was already given a cancer-free diagnosis… and then was still forced to go through yet another round. ⠀
⠀
Honestly, this story is heart-breaking and too involved to share in one post. But I’m including a link in my bio to the full story and I’d encourage you to check it out. More people need to know about this. Please SHARE. #MedicalFreedomForNoah ⠀

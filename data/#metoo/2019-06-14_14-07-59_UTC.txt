Another one of my Pin-Up Ladies mugs now available at STASH! This lovely lady is loving summer! ❤️ And tonight, during Norman’s Second Friday Art Walk, STASH is having their latest Flower Power Market, with dozens of visiting artists, live music by the Brad Fielder Trio, food trucks, and Lazy Circles Brewing’s freshly crafted beer! Check it out and have a great time! 
My pin-up mugs are wheel-thrown stoneware with a ceramic decal and real gold luster accents. Each mug has been through four firings to bring it to perfection, and I'm so proud of them. 
STASH is located at 412 E. Main St., Norman, OK. If you would ever like to purchase a piece I have at STASH, you may call them. They ship!! (405)701-1016

With all of the buzz over #metoo, #churchtoo, #ThisIsNotConsent, and #SexualAssaultAwarenessMonth (April), I have discovered that making pottery with flirty pin-up pictures on it is my favorite artistic way to join the conversation.

Simply put, a woman should be able to go wherever she wants, do whatever she wants, and wear whatever she wants, or nothing at all, without fear of being assaulted. That is the world I dream of.

Pin-up pictures also portray women simply loving life and themselves, feeling empowered and comfortable in their own skin. ❤

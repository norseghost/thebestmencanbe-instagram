Late night writing session over and I am happy with the progress. Made some necessary changes, took out some things that Iâ€™ve been stressing over, but they just didnâ€™t fit ðŸ§© 
Missed my deadline, but had a lot on my plate, paying job wise, and had to push some dates back. Itâ€™s for the greater good so Iâ€™m okay with that. *

Okay so I was counter left again today and like that was cool and all but my freaking expo wouldn't help me with my list at all after asking me if I wanted help like what the hell and then they proceed to take my job which is just taking people's orders like no that's not your job and then they had to leave early because they're not old enough to stay until closing so I'm just kinda mad that they left me with my entire list after saying they'd help me

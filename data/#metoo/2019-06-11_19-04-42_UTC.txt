" ME 2 / HE 2 "
----------------------------------------------
GEG Crew talking about the heavy topic of The #MeToo/#HeToo Movement! First, The Social Media Jawn tells the biggest secret. Secondly, we start talking about some current events like, Harvey Weinstein, Brandon from The Chi, #Slutever and the people we would sleep with and not tell anybody. Then we dive into the topic! What MeToo Movement means to us? Why are women the most critical of the movement?, Is the HeToo Movement on the rise? And Why is there a double standard when it come to the #HeToo Movement! Plus of course the regular GEG Shenanigans all through the episode.

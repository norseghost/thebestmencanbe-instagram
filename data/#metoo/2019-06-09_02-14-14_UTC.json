The bridges that should exist between thought and action, one between silence and transformation, between words and power, and between the white woman feminist and Black feminism. \nShe is a free-thinker of her times, she is set apart in not only her sexual identity but also her sexuality. \nHer most prominent work The Master\u2019s Tools will never dismantle the Master\u2019s house is a clarion call for action, for acknowledging that existing systems of patriarchy and the tools to engage with it are not necessarily going to help us in dismantling patriarchy, but also encourages us to collectively, creatively make new tools and consider ways of making ourselves heard. I have filled my pages with her words, made indescribable notes but seems more overwhelming that someone from another era could get few basic things we are grappling with today so easily, could comment and rally words so promptly #everydaysexism #metoo #periodpoverty #audrelorde @renieddolodge @thereadingwomen #blacklivesmatter #readingwhileblack"

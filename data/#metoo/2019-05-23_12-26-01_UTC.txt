Limiting Beliefs
.
Limiting beliefs work like this:
1. They create a tainted lens through which we start to see our lives and ourselves, skewing our perceptions.
.
2. This lens keeps us stuck in life-limiting thoughts and patterns.
.
3. Believing these limits, we continue to live within the confines of them, further fulfilling that limiting belief, which helps create our reality.
.
4. The limiting beliefs then create a pattern of self-sabotage.
.
There are endless findings now that demonstrate that our empowering or limiting beliefs actually create our reality. As our mind will change the biology of our body according to your subconscious beliefs. Our body’s chemistry looks to that dominant part of our brain for direction.
.
That's why it's essential that the beliefs we hold are good for us and not self-limiting.
.
We are what we think...what are you thinking?
.
If you want change you gotta to be the change or you'll stay the same...or even get worse.
.
If I can help with that change please reach out.

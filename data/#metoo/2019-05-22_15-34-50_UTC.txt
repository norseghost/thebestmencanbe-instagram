#EyeStandWithHer

I stand with the 💕Teen who has to make a hard choice.

I stand with the 💕Wife that’s life is at stake.

I stand with the 💕Sister who wasn’t ready. 
I stand with the 💕Friend who was violated. 
I Stand With Her💕

You are NOT alone.... You are Loved..... You are making the 💕Best Choice for You....... And that is something I will ALWAYS stand up for....... The Right to Choose🙌🏻 #ProChoice #Speakup #Metoo #YourChoice #NolongerSilent

What if?
.
This…
.
How can the goal of life be happiness? Surely we’ve got this upside down, backwards or missing the mark?
.
How can life be about an end result? Unless the phrase “I’ll be happy when I’m dead” is an accurate account.
.
What if life happening is the “goal” of life? What if goals are being scored all the friggin time? Or dare it be said – what if goals are not necessary? Sure, play games and have fun, totally YES. But what if all the striving for more, better, and success is keeping you in an endless loop of never having or being enough?
.
What if everything is happening right here now, not over there or sometime sooner or later? What if ‘you are what you seek’? Yep it’s an old saying that’s been doing the rounds for hundreds of years, much longer than the personal development movement.
.
What if the meaning of life is to be alive, and experience everything and nothing (of which the label happiness can fall into)?
.
What if?
.
This, just this!

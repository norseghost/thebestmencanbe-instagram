I think there’s a common misconception in the world (especially in social media) that things are EASY.
.
Instagram makes it look like building a business is easy. Like traveling the world is easy. Like personal development is easy. Like overcoming struggles and chasing dreams is easy.
.
You get my point!!
.
The thing is.. nothing is easy. There are always going to be struggles and hurdles!
.
You overcome one thing and in comes another! You get everything planned out and organized and then the unthinkable happens!
.
You can complain about it and look at other people with jealous or resentful eyes.. but the truth is:
1) they still have struggles too
2) of their life looks “easier”, most likely they’ve just continuously pushed through the struggles to get to where they wanted to be.

A couple weeks ago one of my clients said something that really stuck with me and hit me in the feels.
.
She said “Kara, I love that no matter what goes wrong you are always looking for an answer and a way through. You get back up and try again and again until something works. It inspires me to push through whenever I’m feeling stuck and I think ‘what would Kara do’?!”
.
Honestly I don’t think I’d realized it or given myself enough credit but pushing through really has been the theme of my life!
.
Anxieties and insecurities. Losing my brother. Sexual assault. Traumatic car accident. Missed opportunities. Starting and failing a business. Starting and struggling to build a second business. Injuries and surgeries. Doors being closed.
...
The only way out is THROUGH. The reason sometimes it looks like life is “easy” and I’m so happy is because I chose to push through those things until I could make them right, or make them hurt less, or find the releasing and healing I needed!
.
I’m sure you’ve had a ton of hurdles to overcome in your life too. We’ve all had them piling up over the years!
.
The biggest secret to success in ANY area of your life is to find a way through. Turn your struggles into strength and you cannot fail. You can only grow bigger and bigger 🙌🏽💕💕
.
Tell me - are you going to find your way through?!

Happy P R I D E month! 🌈♥️🌈
We’re so excited to celebrate pride for the first time this year! Tayen and I have been together for a year and a half, but have only been out for a few months, so we never got the opportunity to experience any pride month festivities. This year we’re hoping to visit Seattle pride and Austin pride! If you know of any other prides that are a must-go, comment below! •

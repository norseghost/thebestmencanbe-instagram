                        "text": "I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. My mom\u2019s family has been in the Bay Area for generations actually - in San Bruno. She even attended Lowell High School. So, my roots here are deep. The Bay Area is and always will be my home. This is a why becoming a sexual assault counselor in my community was so important to me. But to witness how poorly we treat survivors of sexual violence means I can\u2019t just sit back and do nothing. I want you to know what I know so we can take action together and build community.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nHere\u2019s the topline news you need to know about #SF\u2019s response to sexual assault:\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n1. Survivors are still being treated like s*** by police officers, SVU investigators, and officials in the D.A.\u2019s Office who don\u2019t fully understand trauma from sexual violence and the need to be trauma sensitive. (See @missionlocal article that just came out today).\n2. Survivors are not getting their police reports within 5 days, which is the law, and keeps them from filing restraining orders. Police are literally putting survivors in danger. Survivors and their advocates at Bay Area Legal Aid are now suing #SFPD. (See recent @sfexaminer articles).\n3. A couple weeks ago a San Francisco jury found a man guilty for sexual assaulting sex workers in the Mission. This comes on the heels of SB-233, sponsored by @scott_wiener, which seeks to protect sex workers who come forward as witnesses/victims/survivors of sexual assault from arrest. This is currently moving through the state legislature.\n4. The Office of Sexual Harassment and Assault Response and Prevention (see my website for more in-depth description) was created last September as a local watch dog for survivors and is not up and running yet. Although some folks fear it won\u2019t have enough legal power to hold law enforcement agencies accountable to survivors.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nSF is not the only city with these problems. Just because there is a Sexual Assault Response Team doesn\u2019t mean everything is trauma sensitive and survivor-centered. This is the goal of my work: to focus on the local, to focus on improving Sexual Assault Response Teams."

#WhyIStayed (part 1 of 2) || We were together for just under 3 years and in that entire time I did not know I was being abused. I had never heard of psychological abuse before and thought only physical or sexual violence could be considered abuse. My eyes were completely closed to the fact that psychological abuse is in fact a very real and very dangerous form of abuse, often downplayed because its wounds tend not to be physical.⁣⁣

Because I was unaware of this form of abuse, the way I saw it and the way he had me looking at things was that he was just stressed out because of major changes that were happening in his life. He claimed to be working on himself and doing his best to improve his situation and as his girlfriend, I naively thought it was my duty to love and support him through it all. How could I just jump ship when he was going through so much? He’d been so sweet when we first met. I believed that one day he would return to being that way. It’s ironic how I believed him to be the caring, charming person he had shown himself to be for a brief period of time, instead of the angry, disrespectful person he was most of the time. If he ever pushed me too far, he would do a small gesture to win me over and it would work. He saw the compassion in me, the longing for love, the need for acceptance. He knew he could take advantage of the most vulnerable parts of me and he did.⁣⁣

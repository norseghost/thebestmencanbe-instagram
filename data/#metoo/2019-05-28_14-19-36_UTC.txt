In 2016, around this time, I met a hiker who sexually assaulted me and, turns out, multiple other women. It’s taken three years for me to feel like I’ve taken my mountains, my safe place, back. I still scan the face of every hiker I pass, scared it’s him, and I’m reluctant to stop and have conversations with any hiker anymore. I stop to let people pass me, because passing people makes me feel incredibly exposed. However, I’m finally starting to feel safe in the mountains again, and I’m thankful that despite something terrible happening to me in them, they’re still an immense source of healing. I’ve been depressed and anxious six ways from Sunday lately, and it hit me today why: Trauma anniversaries can have a very deep impact without being obviously apparent. I’m thankful for a therapist I can bombard all weekend and friends who I know remember this time in my life. If you’ve got a trauma anniversary, take care of yourself. The feelings that come up can be as traumatic as when the event happened. Meanwhile, this authentic smile gives me hope that I can someday feel 100% safe in my happy place again. #hikingwithdogs #optoutside #hiking #colorado #metoo

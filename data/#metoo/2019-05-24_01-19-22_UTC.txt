Thursday reminder ðŸ–¤ Rpâ€¢ @intuitiveintelligenceinstitute 
The spiritual woman and power. I could write a book on it. In fact I am. The scars in our bodies from the lifetimes of abuse weâ€™ve suffered as women makes us wary. We dumb ourselves down, we settle for far less than weâ€™re worth and worst of all we subconsciously sabotage ourselves all the freaking time. We mostly do that by staying in the comfort zone of the roles prescribed to us. We make ourselves believe that all we want is to play nice, be nice, act nice. (Go find @fleassymalayâ€™s incredible insight into that dangerous word). There is no power in nice. You can be fierce and deeply loved. Invent your own version of mother wife lover sister and meet your power fearlessly. Itâ€™s not up to you to make everyone feel comfortable with your presence.

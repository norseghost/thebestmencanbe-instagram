Sexual Harassment is not a joke, 81% of females and 43% of males have experienced non-consensual comments, looks, and touch throughout their whole life. Only 5% of the victims report to the police because 53% of the victims think that the police wouldn't help or change anything.

The offender is known by the victim in 82% of the incidents and 99% of the time, the offender is male. Some of the effects of sexual harassment are paranoia/anxiety, depression, PTSD, self-consciousness, lack of interest, fatigue, insomnia and could lead to suicide. 
People who could harass you include: - Family member (cousin, uncle, father, etc.)
- Employer (Boss)
- Co-worker
- Friends
- Stranger - Teacher or Professor 
Many more people can sexually harass you and some can do a lot more effect than the others, such as a trusted friend could affect you more than random stranger from the street.

How can we try to put a stop to sexual harassment? - We can spread the #MeToo around. #MeToo is a movement against sexual harassment.
- Stop the offender if you see it happening around you or if someone came out to you to say that someone harassed them.
- Help the victim talk it out, either a therapist, support group, or reporting the offender to the police.
- Donate to an organization that helps victims in need of support.

There are many more ways to try and stop sexual harassment from happening. It is never the victim's fault, even if they wore something that encouraged the offender to make that decision. As a young person who is interested in this topic, I feel like that victims don't deserve what has happened to them and that sexual harassment has been spreading around the world, getting younger people involved. I hope to see that this will be changed one day.

✖️ Recently, I stumbled on an alarming stat from a national survey conducted in 2018 that assessed attitudes towards violence against women. According to the survey, four in ten Australians think sexual assault accusations are simply a way of getting back at men. Another report indicates that a quarter of Australians believe women exaggerate claims or violence.

✖️The #MeToo movement woke many to the rampant experiences of sexual assault across borders and industries. In Australia, sexual violence still affects two in five people aged 18+, but less than 40 per cent of sexual assault, harassment or domestic violence cases are reported. Maybe it's because:

a) We don't know what consent means exactly
b) We don't think it's fair to blame the man every time 
c) We don't know how to help
d) all of the above

✖️In a climate of doubt and scepticism, it's no surprise that many Australians are afraid to speak up or ask for support. As part of my next venture, I want to explore our attitude to consent and blame. If you're interested in voicing your thoughts or sharing your experience, I'd love to hear from you.

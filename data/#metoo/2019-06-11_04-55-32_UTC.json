Does that I mean I\u2019ll never have another flashback, anxiety attack, suicidal thought, hallucination, dissociative episode, or sad day ever again? Probably not, but I\u2019m better prepared to cope with any dark days ahead. I\u2019m also more open to the possibility of experiencing good days for the first time, maybe ever, in my adult life. I have hope, sit in my power, and experience true joy and connectedness a lot more often these days. I finally feel like I\u2019m not just surviving, but thriving. \u2800\n\u2800\nI have so much gratitude for @northlandfamily for helping me find my way back to myself through their free counseling services. If you\u2019re ever feeling generous and are able to you should consider donating to or volunteering with them so they can continue to do their amazing work. \u2800\n\u2800\nNorthland Family Help Center is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, and contributions are tax deductible. They provide professional counseling, legal advocay, crisis, and shelter services free of charge for eligible individuals and families who struggle with the symptoms of traumatic experiences due to current or historical abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, and crime. Being able to access these services has truly made all the difference in my life because NFHC gave me a safe place to feel my feelings, share my story, and begin to heal from the trauma and shame that was paralyzing my life. \u2800\n\u2800\nI am also *so* thankful for every member of my Flagstaff family and community--especially my beautiful, silly, creative, intelligent, and compassionate friends who helped me realize it was possible to laugh and live again. I didn\u2019t think I was worthy of love or respect until I moved back here, but now I am surrounded by friends who see me and love me for me. Every smile, hug, and kind word I have received since returning to this town has helped me relearn what safety, love, trust, and community truly looks and feels like. Thank you<3 #ptsdawarenessmonth #sexualassualtsurvivor #childhoodsexualabusesurvivor #metoo #thestorycontinues\u2800"

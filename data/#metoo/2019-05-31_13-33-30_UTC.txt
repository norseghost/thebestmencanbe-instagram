In the making of a victim, the cycle of abuse is able to thrive off of these 4 Devastating Words - I DON'T BELIEVE YOU....
Close your eyes for a moment. Imagine if you can being 5,11,16 years old and having someone sexually violate you. Their hands are in places they shouldn't be. You're scared, confused and you know it's not right. And, it happens again and again. The person touching you becomes more aggressive and now you are being forced to do things to them. Now, imagine getting to your breaking point and you find the words to tell your parent(s) what you've been enduring and they say, "I don't believe you". Now open your eyes....what are you thinking? What are you feeling? Is your mind racing with confusion? Did you literally feel your heart break and sink to your feet?
When children disclose sexual abuse, they are in the most vulnerable space. They've been carrying the secret of their abuse all the while trying to "act normal". It is absolutely devastating to hear that their family or trusted confidant doesn't believe them.
And, the predators bank on this because they can continue to molest the child and the child feels even more powerless than they did prior to their disclosure.
In Jeannie Mai's case, she did what so many kids do, she ran away from home because her mother didn't believe her. They were estranged for 8 years.
As parents, we MUST take our children's cry for help ever so seriously! Statistically speaking, children RARELY lie about being sexually abused. Believe them. Otherwise, you are condemning them to even more abuse and oftentimes by multiple abusers.

Part 2 (English Follows Japanese) 
娘は欲しくありません。もし娘がいたら、とても心配になるでしょう！娘がデートに行く時に世話を焼いてしまうお父さんに絶対になるでしょう。だってもし男の子が浮気したら？彼が彼女を振ったら？私は常に、より良い男になりたいと思っていますが、全ての男がそうでないことは知っています。彼らは女の子たちに手を出しても平気なのです。しかし、彼らは将来、自分の娘や妹がそのように扱われてもいいのでしょうか？自分の愛する女性が扱われたいように、女性を扱わなければなりません。その為、娘が彼女のなりたいようになれる自由と安全性があると分かるまでは、私は娘は欲しくありません。

I don't want to have a daughter. If I did, I would be so worried about her! I would definitely be that annoying dad looking after her when she goes on a date. Because what if a boy cheats on her? What if he breaks her heart? I always aspire to be a better guy everyday, but I know not all guys are like that: they're okay going around messing with girls. But is that how they would want their future daughter to be treated? Or their sister? You have to treat women the way you would want the women you love to be treated. That's why I don't want to have a daughter — not until I know she can have the freedom and safety to become whoever she wants to be. - Kenneth 📸: 蔵内靖恵

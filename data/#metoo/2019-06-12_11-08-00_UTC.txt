THE STATE OF WOMENS HEALTH
In Australia, intimate partner violence causes more illness, disability and deaths than any other risk factor for women aged 25â€“44.
â€¢ One in every five women have been sexually assaulted or threatened since age 15.
â€¢ Anxiety affects one in three women and depression affects one in every five.
â€¢ 72,000 women and 34,000 children sought homelessness services in 2016-2017 due to family/domestic violence.

We all know someone affected.

What are we doing to support these women, as individuals and communities?

How can we change the story for women and girls?

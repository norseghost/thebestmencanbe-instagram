This one is for all of the monsters in my past—the people who brought the darkness into my world. 
Those who hurt me, those who stood by in silence, those who stole my innocence, those who used me and took advantage of my kindness, those who discarded me like yesterday’s garbage when all I had left to give was my heart, the friends who deserted me without even checking to see if I had a pulse, the men who said I wasn’t enough for them, those who regularly reaped the benefits of my loving heart, but then acted as if it never existed, the so-called Christians who proclaimed me Jezebel—thank you for adding to the darkness that was already dictating my pain-filled existence. 
Thank you for helping me discover how strong I am. If it wasn’t for that all-consuming darkness that tried to destroy my soul, I would have never discovered my light. 
Do you have monsters in your life ? If you’re living in pain or darkness, don’t miss the message. Ask yourself what it is you are meant to learn during this difficult season of your life. There is always a message in our mess, a testimony in our test, and a purpose to our pain. Dig into your darkness, examine it with a microscope, and then destroy it with the beautiful light that has always been living inside of you. 
That’s the thing about the monsters in our lives—they only exist in the darkness. 
Destroy them with your light.

This is part of another #poem of mine. From experience, I know that rape harms your mind, body, and soul. I was in denial at first that this violence had even happened to me. My heart is with all #survivors of abuse. It is not your fault. You do not deserve that violence.💗☮️ #metoo #spreadlove #nomoreviolence #speakout #mentalhealth #poetry #consent #loveisnotviolent #healing #dating

Sanctuary babies 💕 rp @veganplantbasedbody 
Rp @charliesacres -  These three are impossibly cute! 🐽🐽🐽 Victor, Nicholas, and Gilbert were born to a mama pig who was purchased by a rancher who did not know she was pregnant. She gave birth and the piglets were all going to be sold. The rancher had a young friend - 11 year old Nicholas, who asked if he could try and get the piglets and their mom homes at  sanctuaries. The rancher agreed and Nicholas did just that! We now have the three cutest, sweetest, most playful baby boys ever. We even named one after their rescuer! Kids like Nicholas are changing the world. 👏  #friendsnotfood .

Our hearts are still heavy as the Massacre in Sudan is still happening.ðŸ’” Innocent people and protestors are being killed and raped, and there arenâ€™t enough news outlets covering because of the Internet black out enforced by the military. Swipe to find out more & ways you can support the revolution. We will not rest until our people are heard and protected. We stand with all the Sudanese women protesting, rightfully called Kandakaâ€™s â€” women who empower others and fight for their country and rights. They are fighting for their lives right now, fighting for OUR HUMAN right. Fundraisers will be shared on our story. #SudanUprising #Sudan #sudanrevolts #ourwomensvoices

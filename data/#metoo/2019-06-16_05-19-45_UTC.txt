Also I'm to scared to tell my mom I want to see a therapist or to get me tested if I'm depressed and I don't want to say I am but like sometimes I think about all the fucked up shit that has happened to me and I just want to curl up and cry like I've had shit happen to me that no one should ever go through and like I feel like I really need some help

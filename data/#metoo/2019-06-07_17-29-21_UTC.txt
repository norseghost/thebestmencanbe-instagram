Blue. 35mm film. poetry.⁣
⁣
I am eighteen and my lover⁣
loves the color blue⁣
so much so that⁣
Maybe if I am blue enough⁣
he will love me too.⁣
⁣
But I do not come in the form of a pill, no.⁣
I come in the form of collateral damage.⁣
⁣
My lover loves the color blue so much so that⁣
Now my skin is covered in it,⁣
A dull ache worse than a heart break. ⁣
⁣
But I do not come in the form of a pill, no.⁣
I come in the form of a bottle and self sabotage. - @alissamilo.jpg

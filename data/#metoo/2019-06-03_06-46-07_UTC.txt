For decades, women and girls have been at the forefront of effecting change and driving conversations on ending violence against women and girls without including the active agents, men. 
__
To a large extent, impacts have been made; policies and laws have been enacted to protect the rights of women and girls but in order to make a more lasting impact, it is imperative to invite men to be an active part of the solution to end violence against all women and girls.

We can achieve a more peaceful and just world for all women and girls with the support of men.

Happy pride month everyone! With the increasing acceptance of the lgbtq+ community, a lot of companies use pride month as a way of profiting off of its consumer base. This is your reminder to look into the company you choose to shop at and find out if your money will actually support lgbtq+ people. The following are some queer owned companies i recommend: 
@greenboxshop 
@brujas 
@flavnt_streetwear 
@otherwild 🇨🇴

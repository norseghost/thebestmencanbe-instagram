Articulating a new idea out loud, to people who encourage the thought process, is really powerful for me. I spend so much time in my head, and writing volumes of words no one will ever see. So thereâ€™s some cognitive imprinting that happens when I add the sensory impression of supportive words, expressions, and gestures. And sometimes, itâ€™s easier to trust someone elseâ€™s voice. Especially on the positive stuff.

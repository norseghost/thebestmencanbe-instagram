Having a pretty foggy morning y’all. But I’ll get through this. I’ve done this whole accidentally putting my clothes on inside out several times in benzo Withdrawal. I also forgot how to hold my eating utensils this morning. 🍴 But after a few minutes remembered again. This is an example of what my brain injury from the Valium looks like sometimes. But the symptoms are getting some better and I am grateful that I am healing. Sending healing thoughts to each of you as well. 💙

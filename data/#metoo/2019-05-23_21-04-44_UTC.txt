Despite the #MeToo movement, many people are still uncomfortable talking about their experiences. “We don’t talk about blame, and we don’t ask for stories. We just ask for the number of incidents,” the organizer, Elin says.

Elin began Origami Owls Against Sexual Harassment in November 2018 at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Washington, DC. Women, men, and children in the community folded 1,343 owls to reflect the 1,343 instances experienced by 55 people. The healing process of paper folding created a visual representation of the pervasiveness of sexual harassment.

The owls were displayed throughout the church. They received local press coverage and a video was made by Voice of America bringing the message of the Owls to Russia (see: http://TheOwlsAreWatching.com)

Come to Dr Insomniac’s, June 7th at 1 PM, learn how to fold origami owls, and find out more about The Owls are Watching project.

We can’t visit a country, without appreciating the art. It’s like a snapshot of the environment. Encapsulating the culture & the history through the medium of choice for POC. Our art is the richest thing about us in our opinion. You can’t have our prized possessions and ignore our pain. TI did a thing for Atlanta culture with the @trapmusicmuseum

I can be my own worst encourager at times. You?
•
We often will encourage others long before we will encourage ourselves. You and I are worth encouraging!
•
Let’s be our own best friend and start by stopping the negativity that so quickly can devour our minds.
•
Other times I’m a great encourager of “others” outside of my own home. The ones I love and live with and see up close, can get the raw end of the deal.
•
In getting caught up in saying, “no, stop, don’t do that, do this, clean that up, hurry, let’s go,” and on and on, I can forget to stop and speak the words of affirmation and life over them that they need to hear. You?

“All the water in the world won’t sink a ship until it gets inside. If you allow the atmosphere in your home to become negative, it will begin to decay from within.” - @jentezen from his book The Amazing Discernment of Women
•
We can all act like this never happens in our homes or we can just admit that we all have a little room to improve. I know I do!
•
I don’t want to be that woman, that wife, that kind of mom and yet, sometimes I am. Sometimes I mess up and repeat the problem over and over again, instead of focusing on finding a solution.
•
I want to be a problem solver, not a problem repeater.
•
The woman I so often long to be is not always the woman I am.
•
And yet, if I had someone following me around and pointing out what I need to do different all of the time, I would probably be ready to “take that person out”.
•
This thought strikes my heart deep as sometimes I am that person to my children and husband.
•
Sometimes I am that person to myself too.
•
God shows you and I so much grace and love and He calls out the greatness in us far before we often exemplify greatness.
•
This is what I desire to be like.
•
Someone who calls out the greatness in those closest to me, as well as others outside of my home, no matter what I see happening.

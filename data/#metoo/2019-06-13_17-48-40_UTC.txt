My brother spent the day Dr Gabor Mate on Tuesday. ACES is a real thing that affects so many people who have suffered trauma as a child (and my belief in adulthood too). It would be a great benefit to start caring for ourselves, our children and each other in a more whole-istic way. The mind affects the body and the body affects the mind, we have too look at both and take the whole story into account when looking at mental health issues and physical health issues. I love what he says about addiction (something I have personally struggled with in my past) and about helping people to become response-able, able to respond to their lives by using compassion and understanding. It's well worth a watch imoðŸ’™ https://youtu.be/H9hcrf3xtx4

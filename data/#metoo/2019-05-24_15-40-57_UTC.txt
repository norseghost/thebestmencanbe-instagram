ALADDIN, 5/10...⁣
⁣
Aladdin isn’t a bad movie per sé. The craft is there. After watching the train wreck that was 2017’s Beauty and the Beast remake - which was dull, lacked energy, and was completely miscast, I had remarked to my girlfriend after the screening that Guy Ritchie (or Baz Luhrmann, or Edgar Wright) should have made the movie. Then Guy Ritchie signed on to Aladdin, and already this project was looking promising. The first act up until after the fabulous “Never Had a Friend Like Me”, sequence unfolds and hums along at a brisk pace, frame for frame like the animated film, and I quite enjoyed it. It was after that though, as the movie started to add extra story, and the pace slowed way down, that it dawned on me: these Disney live action remakes are soulless and lack any imagination whatsoever.

The music, the scenes, the story all unfold pretty much the same, so you’re not surprised by anything here - all we the audience are doing is comparing these films to the beloved animated classics. When characters burst out into song and dance - it seems out of place. When Will Smith is giving it his all, but is merely redoing what Robin Williams did 27 years ago, and trying to be funny, it’s mostly cringey. Naomi Scott is wonderful as Jasmine, and Mena Massoud mostly works as Aladdin, a

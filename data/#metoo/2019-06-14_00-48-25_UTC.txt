*TRIGGER WARNING* Video contains content re: Sexual Assault.... Hearing this was extremely heartbreaking... Disappointed beyond belief with the  BC Supreme Courts decision.... “My sisters and I chose to go through the criminal justice system to try and stop our abuser from harming other girls. It was a 12-year journey. On June 10th, a very important decision came down in our sexual assault case. Our case was stayed, meaning the charges were dropped, there will be no sentencing, even though our abuser was found guilty last year, April 6, 2018, for four out of six counts” ... ~ @jeetipooni You and your sisters are not alone, our thoughts and prayers are with you as you continue to fight this injustice.. Everyone, Please share this video... We can make change together 🙏💙 #BecauseWeareGirls #genderbasedviolence #sexualassaultaware #canadiancriminaljusticesystem #williamslakebc #canada #sexualassaultawareness #starttheconversation #education #metoo #timesup #shoutouttosurvivors #endchildabuse #itsnotyourfault #notmysecret

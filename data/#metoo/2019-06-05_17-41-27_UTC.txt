If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse, and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.

Knowing what's right doesn't mean much unless you do what's right. Seeing the world from the stars' point of view can be unbearably lonely.

People often associate suicide as a form of cowardice and escapism. I say no. What's cowardly is treating someone so badly that he/ she wants to commit suicide.

If you are constantly putting someone down or going way out to attack someone, you must be ugly on the inside. Period.
.
Because so and so had a tough life, that’s why it made them a big bully. Because so and so grew up in an abusive family that’s why we should be more forgiving towards them. Understand that no matter the circumstances, it is never a passport to be an oppressor. A bully.
.
I do not, and do not want to comprehend why the society is more concerned about the mental wellbeing of the perpetrator than the wellbeing of the victim.
.
Some people don’t feel healed by forgiving the people who hurt them because this is what they have been taught to do so over and over again by the gracious social stigma. Rather, they can truly be healed by standing up and say “You have been horrible to me and I do not deserve this kind of treatment from you. I do not have to be ok with it”. It is alright to set boundaries, to say “I want justice” without feeling extreme guilt.
.
If you can’t help someone. At least don’t harm them. If you can’t find sunshine where you are. Be one yourself.

I have a lot of mixed emotions but I'm more relieved than anything. I chose to share my story because it was hearing other women tell theirs, that helped me understand what happened to me was not ok and I deserve justice and healing. \nI'm so grateful for my boyfriend @azlandhanuman and my parents and family for giving me all the unconditional love and support I needed. As well as @sara_amelia_ for traveling to edmonton from BC to go on the stand, just to basically affirm that she drove me to the police station.. Even if you had to be, I'm so glad you were there.\n\nThe first police station Sara drove me to.. a group of cops were standing outside, so we told them what happened.. This cop, blank faced, just immediately looks at his wrist watch and then mutters something to the group. They then sent us away to a different station across the city because \"they were off their shift\". I didnt get any compassion or even asked if I was ok, nothing. Sara then drove us across the city and sat with me in a parking lot for hours waiting for the next police station to open. Luckily the police at this station really cared, and were angry to hear about the other cops who coldly sent us away, one of them even said \"what good are we if we arent there to help people?\". After I filed the report, they drove us to the hospital so I could get the rape kit done, which felt kind of traumatizing for me, no matter how nice and gentle the nurse was being.. having to lay there with my legs spread open, getting a photo taken of my exposed private area, having objects inserted into me and my private parts swabbed and prodded at.. it felt like being violated again in a way, even tho I feel really bad saying that cuz the nurse was a very kind and caring woman who was just doing her job. \nContinued in comments..\n#metoo"

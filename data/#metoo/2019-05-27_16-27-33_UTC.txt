#MaternalMonday by @mimizahb:

We went home with our baby and my ob told me the day I left: “remember that all days won’t be happy and that you may feel really sad and empty even as you are experiencing the happiest time of your life. If you feel sad please call the office and come see me”. I remember thinking: I know, I know, new moms feel sad, they cry, I’ve heard it all and I’m ready. I’m tough, I know all the signs and I am so happy right now that I’m pretty sure that won’t happen to me. How could it?

I had a spinal headache a few days after I gave birth which made me feel like my head was exploding. I got a blood patch and nothing helped. The only way I felt better was lying down. We had to go to our first trip to the pediatrician as a family and I could not stand up. I. Could. Not. I had enough energy to just sort of stand up and exist. I remember seeing a mom with a 14 day old holding her baby in a carseat and thinking to myself: Just wait 10 days and you will be able to smile and hold your carseat too. As soon as I got back to the elevator in our home I sat on the floor. I had used up all of my energy to get to the pediatrician and back. I was no longer able to pretend that I could stand up.”

"The answer is blatantly clear. Men are losing their reverence for women because feminist ideology promotes the culture of anti-male nihilism through the feminization of men. By extension, it is actively destroying everything that is sacred about women since it robs femininity and masculinity of any meaning. In addition, show's a reflection of the larger cultural trend where women are encouraged to emasculate men. It is not a coincidence that feminism brands strong, capable, action-oriented masculinity as toxic because feminism scorn men for being men. In essence, hatred of men breeds hatredÂ of women". #mgtow #feminism #metoo #truth #relationships #men #women #divided #society #false #realtalkðŸ’¯ #equality

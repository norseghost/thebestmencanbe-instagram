STEREOTYPES ~JUDGEMENTS~LABELS

I see and read a lot of posts, blogs, articles you name it not just for personal gains but to use in my blogs or to help my friends. And one recurring thing that keeps coming up are these comments about how
"no one will love you until you love yourself" or "you will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything" etc. 
Now dont get me wrong, some of the things said can be beneficial,  but other times I think they do more harm than good. 
As someone with multiple mental health issues which relate to my emotional reactions, i cant control it, i cant stop it, and it will be me for life. So does that mean i will suffer forever? No. 
And just because i cant love myself does that mean someone else wont see my beauty, my drive, my humour? And someone will not love me? No. I know personally, i see these things and get upset by them for a while, fixate on what was said and hope that one day ill stop so ill be normal. But it shouldn't be like that.  This isn't something we have caused. I can still be loved and i wont suffer, and i will be successful regardless of how emotional I am.

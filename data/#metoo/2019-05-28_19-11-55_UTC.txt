I am a dreamer - a big one!  I think that is also why￼ I love reading - it allows me dream and go elsewhere. I get so caught up in the story, it takes me a little bit to come back to reality when I’m done with a book.  I often skip movies if I’ve read the book first because the movie never lives up to how I imagined the story.

Yet with all of this dreaming I love to do, whether it is from stories I’ve read, innovative ideas I’ve come up with, or different ways to add to my coaching services, dreaming doesn’t make any of them come to fruition.  I love dreaming but it isn’t enough.  We need to take action to make our dreams come true.  How do you take action?

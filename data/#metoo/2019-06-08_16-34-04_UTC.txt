- I AM IN NO MEANS PUSHING ANYBODY TO DO WHAT THEY DON’T WANT TO, NOR AM I SAYING THAT IF YOU EAT MEAT THEN YOU’RE A BAD PERSON! -
🌳
i was doing some research today and after finding out all of this, i’ve decided to do my little bit for the planet and become a vegetarian! today is my first day😊
🌍
i couldn’t believe how much of a difference eating meat makes to our world, nor how much damage the whole meat trade does to our planet! i was shocked!😳
🌳
i hope you enjoy learning about this as much as i did, and as much as i enjoyed creating this slide!☺️

“Naz is the definition of a professional. She knows her style, and she loves what she does. She is tireless when it comes to finding exactly the right outfit that excites her, AND her client! She has encouraged me to take chances while simultaneously respecting my comfort zone. She is a wonderful collaborator. If you’re looking for a stylist at the top of their game, you’d be foolish not to seek out her services” - Sterling K. Brown

I have a love/hate relationship with healing. On the one hand, I feel stronger than I ever felt possible - as if I’m standing straight up in this Wonder Woman pose. ⠀
⠀
But on the other hand, there are days those same feelings of strength are simply out of my reach. Days when I wake up and for no other reason than it’s a new day, it seems harder than the others. ⠀
⠀
I used to fight it - to try to figure out what I had done differently to set myself back in one way or another. But over time, I’ve embraced this as “the process” - leaning into hard days just as I lean into good ones. Understanding that “feeling the feelings” isn’t something for sappy, sensitive people but instead for strong warriors willing to walk through all of it. ⠀
⠀
I’ve promised myself I’d be honest here - with you and myself about what this whole journey looks like - so here it is. Yesterday was a hard day. But even when this roller coaster dips down low, I feel loved, supported and girded up, surrounded by Jesus’s grace and covered in His love. So as difficult as it may be, I know it is deep and rich and full of His goodness to grab ahold of even here. ⠀

Have you walked a healing process before, friend? What did it look like for you - did you have ups and downs too? Let’s encourage one another to move forward below! ⠀

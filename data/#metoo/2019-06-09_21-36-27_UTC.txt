K, so I’m posting a pre-dancing booty shorts selfie to talk about sexual harassment, bc IG is a visual medium and I want to tell the story here. Bear with me.  I went out dancing last night with my sister (80’s themed, hence the outfit) to celebrate her birthday. As I was leaving the club, I passed a group of frat boy-looking types who then started yelling at someone “Hey sexy, look at me! Look at me! Look at me!” And then, when they didn’t get a response; they yelled, “Ugly! Slut!” I thought about putting my head down and walking to my car, in case it was me they were talking to (I’m old enough I don’t get much of this, but I was wearing short shorts, and no one is really safe from this behavior), and with awareness of the danger men like this pose.  But I decided I have just had too much of toxic men dominating and it going unchecked, so I turned around and I yelled at them. I walked fast towards them and yelled that they’re not fucking entitled to anyone’s attention or anyone’s body. They were scared looking and taken aback and said they were joking and it was just to a man they were speaking. I told them it’s not fucking OK anyway, no matter who they’re speaking to. They averted their eyes and started to walk away.

Everyday life in the patriarchy. 
Also, note to men: I’m down to do this, but please don’t leave it to the 5’2” woman in little shorts alone at night to call men out on this behavior. Do it yourselves. || #StepUpMen #genderbasedviolence #sexualharassment  #standupspeakup #vetoviolence #metoo

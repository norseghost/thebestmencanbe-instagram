It is okay
To not be okay. 
That doesnâ€™t make you weak
It makes you strong.

Allow yourself to feel...
whatever comes up to be felt

Cry when you need to cry...
Nurture the hell out of yourself!

When stuff comes up...
let it... Take a breath...
take another...
and another.

Breathe yourself through the pain

Know that today is just a day
You got this!

You are a beautiful, strong, and radiant 
You have so much to share with this world!

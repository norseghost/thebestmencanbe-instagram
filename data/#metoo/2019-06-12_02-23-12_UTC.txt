CW: SEXUAL ASSAULT I am posting the “art” that I referenced in my last post because I believe that, at the very least, my friend deserves a sincere apology. I have blacked out her name to protect the privacy that was stolen from her by this piece. I see what the artist was going for, but the irony of outing my friend AND profiting on a financial/professional level by using her name + trauma WITHOUT HER CONSENT is irony at its very worst. Andrea Bowers: You have absolutely no idea what catastrophic effect it could have for someone to see their trauma literally blown up like this, and to know that thousands of people across the world are doing the same. If you wanted to make such a profound statement on the #metoo movement, shouldn’t you have thought of the actual victims first?

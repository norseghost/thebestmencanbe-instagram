Heyo, I’m not dead aha
Sorry for not posting much body confidence stuff, I’ve been really low lately and my confidence hasn’t been too great but it’s improving! I never realised I relied on some people as much as I did, good and bad people but it’s wild how much I change for the better without the bad and good figures on my shoulders telling me what I should do  and should be. Anyway, I hope you’re all doing good 💕

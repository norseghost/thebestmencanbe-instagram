“In the past 50 years, I’m the most afraid right now (for gender equality, women’s rights and health). We are at an historical low moment. We must re-double our efforts!” Tina Tchen, #Timesup & former White House Chief of Staff...I’m in total awe of these brilliant change makers! Privileged to listen to Tarana Burke (#metoo) Zoleka Mandela (Nelson Mandela’s grand daughter),Ailbhe Smyth (Irish activist that led the movement to make abortion legal), Barkha Dutt (We the women & journalist) plus more! #WD2019 #ThePowerof Movements “Movements unite us and connect us!” #inspired

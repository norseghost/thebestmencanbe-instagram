"Back in April, Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir was ousted after months of protests and a military coup. What has followed has been a violent attack on civilian protesters by military officials as the country transitions to new power. Here, all you need to know about what's happening in Sudan, including the recent killings, internet blackout, and protests.

What happened to the former president?

In April, a coup led to the ousting of the Sudanese president, who had been in power since 1989 and had previously been indicted for war crimes and genocide in Darfur. Once the president left, military leaders said they would agree to civilian rule, though they then stepped in to run the transitional government. The New York Times reports that civilian negotiators offered a compromise that would feature rotating power between the civilians and military leaders. However, the talks dissolved and civilians instituted a two-day strike.

So how did things turn violent?

In what seems to be a response to the strike, paramilitary and security forces raided unarmed demonstrators at the capital of Sudan who were peacefully protesting.

According to the Federal Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization, the violence resulted in 52 people dead and 784 injured, though the report says that the number of injured people could be higher. The military also created an internet blackout by cutting off mobile data, which NPR reports most Sudanese people use to access the internet, leaving many without the ability to communicate or disseminate information.

Other civilian reports have put the death count at over 100 and have said a number of bodies were dumped into the Nile river. According to the Times, civilians reported that soldiers had raped women and looted stores, while other burned tents and beat protesters. Protest leaders say the violence stretched beyond the capital..." Source: Elle.com

#SabineCounty #MeToo #Texas

Sabine County sheriff's deputy David Boyd, who is also a constable and a church pastor, has been sued in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas by a woman accusing him of sexual misconduct.

The woman says Boyd used his position as a law enforcement officer to act as a sexual predator.

The county and the sheriff's office are also named in the federal civil lawsuit and are accused of ignoring what the lawsuit calls Boyd's conduct toward women and possibly men in Sabine County.  Although not named as a defendant, the complaint also alleges that the District Attorney's Office did nothing to correct the situation.

The allegations are laid out in more than a dozen pages filed in federal court.

•• I M P O R T A N T •• Boundaries 
#Advocate #Idaho ————————————————————————
Boundaries are essential in meeting our own needs.
It’s our responsibility to speak up for ourselves when we have difficulty saying no, when we override our own needs to please others, or are bothered by someone who is demanding, controlling, criticizing, pushy, abusive, or invasive.
Remember, setting boundaries isn’t selfish. What other boundaries can you add to this list?

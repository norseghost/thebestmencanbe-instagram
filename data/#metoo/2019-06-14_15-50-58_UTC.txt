Since posting my story about childhood sexual abuse I have gotten so many messages from women who are struggling in silence with anxiety and depression stemming from past trauma. I cannot tell you how much this breaks my heart because I have been there. I have struggled with feelings of worthlessness and anxiety that crept up on me from nowhere! I didn't talk about any of it for years and years because I was too embarassed. Something in me still felt guilty about what "I let" happen to me. My rational mind knew that it wasn't my fault, but something inside me couldn't let go of those feelings. If you are one of those women struggling with a horrible thing that was done to you, please reach out! It is insane how many people have been through the same thing you are going through. You are not alone, it is not your fault, and you can overcome it! It can get better.

I used to think sexual assault happened below the belt. It doesn’t. A few months ago I experienced something I thought would never happen to me, that I was prepared to prevent or stop. In the moment, however, I was paralyzed by fear. I didn’t want to get in the back seat of his car and told him so but then caved. Stand your ground. Just say no. A kiss isn’t permission to trap and touch someone. Looking back on it, I realize now that he was essentially fingering my nipple in an attempt to arouse me. In the moment, however, all I could think of was getting out of there, getting away. He was drunk and unstable emotionally. I wanted to be kind. Don’t. Don’t worry about his feelings, clearly he isn’t worried about yours. I thought I was strong, that nobody would dare mess with me and could stop anyone who tried. I was wrong. When he talks to you the next day, don’t play it off and be friendly. Don’t be nice. Stop talking to him and tell him no. Even if he’s your manager and you have to work together. Don’t believe the rape culture of “that means he likes you” or “he was just drunk.” A man that likes you won’t put you in that position, make you feel that fear. Don’t be nice to him afterward, cut off all communication and report what happened. Don’t give him a second chance. Say no. Don’t say you have to leave or want to go home. Don’t be polite. Make it clear and say no. No I don’t want to be in this backseat. No I don’t want your hand up my shirt while you suck on my neck. No. No. No.  #metoo #metoomovement

Hi, I've been thinking about this for a long time.  I've had this instagram Anxiety inspiration for quite a few years now!  And I've got so many friends in here, many of you have become my closest friends even!  I have for a while felt that I have become this Â«anxietyÂ» bubble that is just about mental health.  There is so much mental health and less me, less of Lise.  that I thought now is the time that change the name of the instagram to my own name.  Of course I will share a lot about my mental health, what goes on in my life, the court case I hopefully get one day, but not just mental health.  I want to thank you who have been following me for so many years and you who have only been here a few days!  hope you follow me further because there is so much changes in my life going forward now that i know will be great ! ðŸŒ» Much love .

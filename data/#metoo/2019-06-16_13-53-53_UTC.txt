This establishment treats and pays women employees differently than men, they employ bartenders who have records of violence toward women. They fired a female bartender who complained of sexual harassment, yet kept the male bartender who was assaulting her. In the past they have bailed out an employee after he physically assaulted a former female staff member. The charge was obstruction of breath because of the bruises and broken capillaries on her neck, in addition to the black eye. I havenâ€™t been able to publicly discuss what he did to me, but I found the courage today. #equalityforall #metoo

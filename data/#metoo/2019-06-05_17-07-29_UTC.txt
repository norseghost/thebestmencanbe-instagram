TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ domestic abuse | I may look happy in this photo but in reality it was only a few months earlier that I’d come out of an abusive relationship. Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) hadn’t fully hit me yet. ▫️
1 in 4 women will experience domestic abuse at some point in their lifetime and 2 women are killed each week in England and Wales by a current or former partner. These were just ‘stats’ to me until I experienced the horrors of domestic abuse. ▫️
My abuser was charming at first and reeled me in. I experienced sexual abuse, coercive control and domestic abuse - leaving me feeling powerless. He snapped at me for little things. He humiliated me in front of his friends. He told me I wouldn’t amount to much. And he tried to strangle me yet passed it off as “practising martial arts.” Plus, much more.
▫️
I was lucky in that this relationship came to an end and he hasn’t bothered me since. Yet, many women aren’t. Imagine living with an abuser and having their children and trying to leave the family home but being stalked, harassed and threatened. That’s where @refugecharity come in offering these women and children support and refuge. I want to help women in these situations, that’s why I’m doing a hike for Refuge. 🥾⛰🏕. I’ll be walking the Yorkshire Three Peaks, which involves camping overnight. Anyone that knows me will know that I hate camping 🏕 so this is a really big deal for me! 💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛PLEASE DONATE (if you can, every little helps) - @justgiving LINK IN BIO ⬆️⬆️⬆️THANK YOU 💕 #TeamRefuge #domesticabuse #coercivecontrol #enddomesticabuse #sexualassualt #metoo #yorkshirethreepeaks #yorkshirethreepeakschallenge #charityfundraising #posttraumaticstressdisorder #fundraising #ptsd #trauma #mentalhealth #yourstorymatters #domesticabuseawareness #domesticabusesurvivor #sponsorship #fundraiser #sponsorme #JustGiving #justgivingpage #hikersuk #rambling #charitytuesday #thisgirlcan #domesticviolence #gaslighting #feminist #lovedoesnthurt

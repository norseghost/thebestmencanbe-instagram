”Victorious is a true and inspiring story of real pain and real healing. This was the first book I’ve read start-to-finish in one morning in a very long time. A tear-jerking page-turner, this book brings forth the reality so many women can relate to when they step back and take a deeper look at what has shaped them into who they are today...and how they want to proceed in taking steps to move forward in life and heal from past pain, lessons, and heartbreak.” VICTORIOUS-A Woman’s Journey of Survival, Transformation, and Healing

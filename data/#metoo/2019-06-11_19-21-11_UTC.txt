PMDD.
Today I’m painting for my Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.
Tho I’ve had symptoms all my life, I wasn’t formally diagnosed until I was 36. Which really, the self-diagnosis came first (through a quiz on pmscomfort.com), then the official diagnosis from a sub-dr who literally used these words to me verbatim: “While your symptoms are consistent with the PMDD diagnosis, I don’t really know what to do for you.”
🙄
At 36yo, after logging my own wacky menstrual cycle symptoms for more than a year, life as I’ve always known it would change-  now that it had a name.
[I’m linking the quiz I took in my bio, for those that think they may have PMDD. It’s a good place to start.]

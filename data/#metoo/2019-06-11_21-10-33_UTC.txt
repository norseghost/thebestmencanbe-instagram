I’m going to be vulnerable for just a second. .
My childhood was ROUGH. I could argue that, in some ways, I never actually got to be a child. .
I spent a lot of time feeling as though I was ruined forever. I’ve had a lot of days where I’ve said to myself “if this is all that life is, it’s not worth it. Why am I here for this?”
.
This photo. This is why I’m here. These girls are everything. They deserve the best. They will have the best. They will get to be children for as long as I am alive. .
I say it all the time. I strive to give my girls a childhood that they won’t need to recover from, but I rarely give credit to the one that I had. I’d survive through that life 10 billion times over if it meant that I could continue to show up for my girls the way that I do now. It is so strange to say; but I am thankful for my trauma and most importantly, for my recovery. 💜

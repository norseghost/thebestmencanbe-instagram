Inner work.
It sounds so cliché.
Before you think I’ve gone crazy, hear me out.
We all have a deep hurt or bad memory from childhood or school days.
That time our friend didn’t have our back when the class bully was mean.
She stole my neon crayons.
They didn’t include me.
I was picked last for baseball. 
I was told I am fat.
I was told I stink.
Or maybe you had a family member treat you mean or maybe even sexually abused you.
It causes pain to rear up, or triggers.
We do whatever we can to forget that moment but we seem to forget that it won’t ever go away.
Unless we take the time to go there to that place of hurt and feel the pain; cry, and tell ourselves it’s ok to feel it- we can heal from the trauma.
However big or small it was.
Knowing it’s ok to go there even if someone else thinks it may be silly.
It’s ok. It’s not their pain. It’s yours.
That’s inner work.
And it’s healing.
And so important.
Love yourself.
You are a royalty.
Now treat yourself as such.

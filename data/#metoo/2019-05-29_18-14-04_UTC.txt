SO dear Black people,  Tarana Burke et al are we going to boycott MLK and #mute the entire #civilrights movement ??? If you still cannot see how #metoo affects the black community & society at large keep harping on 💁🏻‍♀️ .... Should we #MuteMLK or #Mute what he stood for ? Since we cannot separate the man and his work or the artists and the art . Nobody is a saint and wheareas we have to condemn bad behavior donot destroy legacies in an attempt to make yourself feel good about women's rights

                        "text": "Someone does not have to be hurting you physically for it to be considered abuse.\u2063\n\u2063\nWe may overlook these warning signs because more light is generally shone on physical violence than on psychological/emotional violence. Abused women are usually portrayed in the media with physical wounds and this forms in our minds the idea of what abuse is. The lack of evidence psychological abuse leaves behind makes it more difficult to recognize it and escape. Not only is there less support for us in the court system, but we ourselves may minimize the incidents due to this lack of evidence. Not being able to see it physically can make it difficult to gauge the risk of danger and the damage being done.\u2063\n\u2063\nMany of us encounter the warning signs mentioned above and think, \u201cAt least they\u2019re not hitting me,\u201d and we remain in these situations believing things aren\u2019t all that bad. But when we are subject to psychological abuse for long enough, it erodes our sense of self worth and overwhelms us with self doubt. Our sense of reality gets distorted and we lose confidence in ourselves. What happens when any part of our body is punched over and over again? It becomes more and more damaged and weak. Now imagine the same repetitive violence happening mentally.\u2063\n\u2063\nPeople who have been abused in this way are more likely to experience post-traumatic stress disorder than people who have experienced physical violence. And although the psychological or emotional abuse someone is experiencing may not involve physical violence, most physical violence in relationships is preceded by psychological abuse. In other words, just because the psychological abuse has not gotten physical, does not mean that it won\u2019t. \u2063\n\u2063\nHave you experienced any of the warning signs listed here? What do you feel is missing from this list?\u2063"

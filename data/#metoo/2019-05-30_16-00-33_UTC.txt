It would seem that we are in a Golden Age for the genre formerly known as “teen movie”, where classics of old were the likes of #animalhouse #American Pie & more recently #superbad , we are now faced with films that are as funny as those (largely) “gross-out” hits but also have a great deal more brain behind the crude language & bodily fluids. Of course it helps that in the age of movements such as #metoo we are now seeing the female characters given as much depth & screen time as their male counterparts, more than mere trophies to be won (to put it charitably), though it’s certainly important to note that their have been significant examples of this pre-“me too” in the past, see #10thingsihateaboutyou for example…

Tonally I was reminded of not only 10 Things, but far more fresh in the memory, #netflix excellent series #sexeducation , it’s a film with a similar amount of heart to balance the humour which (it is important to note) is a masterful blend of many types, not just sexual, though that particular brand does yield at least 4 hilariously memorable set-pieces, not least a mix-up in a taxi involving porn & an AV adapter!!! This though is just an example of the film’s surface pleasures (so to speak!), dig a little deeper, & the deeper still & you can peel away the

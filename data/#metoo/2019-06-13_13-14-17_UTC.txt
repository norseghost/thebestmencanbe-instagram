One of the struggles with #ptsd is that it comes in waves.  Even after years of therapy and over all successful treatment, some days just get me. Today is one of those days where even though I realize the relationship I had with Noah was incredibly toxic and unhealthy, Noah himself was abusive and unhealthy, and I’m 1000x better off without him in my life... I miss him. 
Today: I miss his face. I miss the way his left incisor is smaller than the rest of his teeth because he walked into a car door, knocked it out, and the dentist who fixed it ordered the wrong size implant. I miss the obnoxious glint in his eyes when he was truly feeling well, happy, and stable. A very rare occasion. I miss the way his hair was always a wavy mess, until it got long enough to put back or he cut it off out of frustration and impatience. I miss the scar in his left eyebrow one of many that litter his face as homage to the ways he would hurt himself with reckless abandon when he lost control. It matches my chicken pox scar in the same place. I even miss the guilt/fear he would show when he was upset or angry. In spite of everything he put me through and the way he treated me, I loved him. I hated him. I miss him, and I never want to see him again. All at once.

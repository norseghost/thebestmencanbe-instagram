About the zine :

Have you ever had an opinion so controversial that you felt like you could never express it?

All our opinions are formed by our own individualÂ 
experiences of life, this is why we often run into people who have different opinion from ours because everyone is living their own unique story and hence have their own unique opinions and feelings.

This Zine comprises of a series of anonymousÂ 
controversial opinions held by individuals who believe they donâ€™t have the ability to express their opinions openly.

The purpose of this zine isnâ€™t to change peoples opinions, theyâ€™re just meant to be read with a clear open mind.

All these opinions were collected anonymously using an anonymous google form.

So brace yourselves as this zine takes you on a roller coaster ride and get ready to have your mind blown.

AllÂ print copies of the zine come with two free multipurpose stickers!

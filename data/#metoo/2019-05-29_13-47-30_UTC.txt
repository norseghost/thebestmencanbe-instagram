“It is so easy for the US Democratic Party to blame everything on Donald Trump by using him as an escape goat to cover up the gap they have created between the party and the American People due to their high level of addiction to easy money and their contempt for Human Rights and Social Justice. They should leave with shame the leadership of this party and let the fresh, energetic recently elected young Congresswomen take over the party to save it from this miserable death and make it the party of American People🗽🇺🇸💕💋once again.”R.F.

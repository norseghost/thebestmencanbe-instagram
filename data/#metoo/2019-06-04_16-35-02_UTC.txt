When talking about diversity and inclusion in the workplace, a subject that isn’t tackled nearly enough is class. Why?⠀
In April 2019, The Social Mobility Commission published a State of the Nation 2018 to 2019 report, which revealed social mobility had stagnated for the past four years and urged for urgent action to close the class privilege gap:⠀
⠀
“Inequality is now entrenched in Britain from birth to work […] Being born privileged still means you usually remain privileged.”⠀
⠀
The longevity of disadvantage suffered by individuals born to working class families in this report makes for disheartening reading. Disadvantaged children enter their school years behind their peers. With good schooling, however, they do have the ability to catch up – but as long as the opportunity for quality education is available to them.⠀
⠀
Similarly, although more students from disadvantaged backgrounds are entering university, they are also more likely to drop out before they graduate. Plus, despite calls for changes to university intake criteria, privileged students continue to have an advantage when applying for places at Russell Group Universities; the knock-on impact of which is greater influence and opportunity in the job market.⠀
⠀
Consequently, the privileged are nearly 80% more likely to attain professional jobs than the working class. And, as the State of the Nation report highlights, “[e]ven when people from disadvantaged backgrounds land a professional job, they earn 17% less than their privileged colleagues”.⠀
⠀
So, what can be done to close the class privilege gap in the workplace?

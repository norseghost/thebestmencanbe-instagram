                        "text": "I\u2019m posting this quote by Chris Emdin again because it strikes at the heart of everything I\u2019m thinking and feeling right now. He isn\u2019t coming from the yoga world, but speaks in terms that are most applicable to what we\u2019re all going through. He writes, \u201cyou become a good teacher when your presence is not needed for learning to happen. You become most capable when your students make you replaceable. You are closest to mastering your craft when your presence enhances but without you the class still dances.\u201d\n\u2800\nI announced my breakup with yoga a year ago, but it\u2019s been many years in the making. I saw what was happening in the Ashtanga community and decided then and there I wasn\u2019t in the business of separating the teachings from the teacher. I had to let both go.\n\u2800\nI tried to convince myself that the pain I experienced in yoga was only physical. I distilled my reasoning down to the level of my tissues, believing it was a product of repetitive joint positions and loading profiles. I thought that stepping away and doing other things was what made my pain subside. It did, but not for all the reasons I could see at the time.\n\u2800\nHere\u2019s the catch: nothing exists on a purely physical level.\n\u2800\nI convinced myself that the yoga part was fine, that the key to my recovery was adding in other things. I realize now that I have healed by subtraction as much as addition. I needed space away from the yoga classroom to assert myself as myself. I needed permission to guide my own body. When I began moving in other ways, lifting weights, and building strength I not only built capacity in my tissues, I built up my courage to say no to the classroom environments that were doing me harm. Harm on all levels\u2014physical, psychological, social, emotional.\n\u2800\nAs stories now surface about BKS Iyengar and teachers who\u2019ve perpetuated his methods, I\u2019m not surprised. I can\u2019t count the number of times I wanted to walk out of a yoga class (across many methods, not only Iyengar) because the environment felt unsafe, because my nervous system was on high alert, because I was physically handled in inappropriate ways. But I didn\u2019t walk out. I didn\u2019t say anything to anyone for years.\n\u2800\nContinued in comments \u2014>"

For #AwarenessWednesday today, we are promoting @girlsinc, an organisation dedicated to helping girls navigate gender, economic and social barriers.

The Girls Inc. team deliver research-based curricula in a supportive all-female environment. Girls are equipped to achieve academically; lead healthy, physically active lives; manage money; navigate media messages; and discover an interest in science, technology, engineering, and math. ðŸ’ªFind out more about their inspirational programs and how you can support them: girlsincnyc.org .

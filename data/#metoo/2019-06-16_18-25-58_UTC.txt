about me; i'm a teenager from massachusetts & i go to a performing arts school. before this year, i wasn't being taught about the important things that i'm gonna talk about on here. so if i say anything that's problematic or incorrect, don't hesitate to dm me! i'm always open to hear what can be fixed💛

domestic violence and abuse/assault are topics that are extremely widespread and violent yet so rarely talked about. while this can be true anywhere, i’m specifically talking about normalized violence in mexico. as most of you know, i had a series of questions on my story directed towards survivors of abuse and assaults. one of the reasons someone didn’t report was because she lives in mexico. i didn’t even think how countries could limit the justice of survivors and i told her i would look into it and post about it. the women in mexico are pushed down and suppressed all too often and together, we can be the generation to bring equality throughout international society. one way we can do that is to talk about it!! don’t stop talking about it! if we stop talking about it, they win and equality loses! i won’t stop talking about it and i hope you won’t either!!

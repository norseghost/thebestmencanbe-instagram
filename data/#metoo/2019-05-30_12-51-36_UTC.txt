How to Be a Woman in a Man’s World (2/6)

Recently, I was commissioned to work on a piece for an acquaintance's partner. I have done all sorts of illustrations for all types of people and projects. A deposit was made and then cryptic comments about their “relationship woes”, messages with an unintentional typo (overtly sexual), and then suggestions to meet up for celebratory drinks were made. The culmination of these seemingly innocuous events made the situation uncomfortable for me because we had never established a personal relationship or friendship of any sort. I instinctually felt that something was off and started to second guess myself, which I feel like many women experience. And because of this doubt, I decided to confirm whether my sense of discomfort was valid. As it turns out, the sense that something wasn't quite right was confirmed via social media.
_
Ultimately, I ended the project in the most polite and professional way possible after this acquaintance unexpectedly contacted me to temporarily put the project on hold. .

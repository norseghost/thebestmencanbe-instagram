Recently I discovered that I'm quite the messy painter, can't seem to help it. But you know what, I like that I am. There is something incredibly raw and beautiful about the process of expressing myself through art. So I get paint all over my fingers, maybe a little on my cheek, a splatter in my hair. This is me, letting my soul speak freely and I wouldn't change a Damn thing about it.

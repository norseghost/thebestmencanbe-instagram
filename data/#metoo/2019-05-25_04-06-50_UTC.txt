Happy birthday to MY SON, @wheresmeeks @meekstne  My Pride & Joy, My heart, My everything. May God continue to bless your path, cover you with his protection, remove any obstacles that may stand in your way.  I affirm, declare and decree on this day and every day forth. That your life be blessed with health, wealth, physical and mental strength, success, abundance and most of all Joy. Son I named you Malik, which means King and I did not do that by accident. Stand in the truth of who you are. Love you from day one and always will.

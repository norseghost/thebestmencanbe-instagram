Celebrating 6 months of sobriety! It has probably been the toughest time in my life, but I feel like I am free. The healing process is painful and facing reality is even harder. Forgiveness is so powerful, gratitude even more so. I know we all have something that holds us back. The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer has literally changed my life. It is a book worth reading. Looking forward to everything ahead, and that's a pretty amazing feeling!

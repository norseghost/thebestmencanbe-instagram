I appreciate the author\u2019s candor and willingness to write with such openness. She takes responsibility for herself as much as she describes the lasting effects of trauma.\u201d \u201cIt is WORTH THE READ. It\u2019s about a woman empowered and, my God, that is a wonderful thing indeed.\u201d \u201cThe author gets to the point while still painting a very clear and definite picture for the readers and I love that. The accounts of the trauma are laid out in such a way that you know what\u2019s happening and are able to imagine it but you aren\u2019t bombarded with intense graphic imagery, which I appreciate as a survivor myself. Would definitely recommend!\u201d \u201cThis amazingly written gem takes you inside the author\u2019s world and keeps you there, making you feel like a discreet \u201cbug on the wall.\u201d I could not put it down.\u201d \u201cI wish everyone would write a memoir. It would be so much easier to understand people. I haven\u2019t been through anything as violent or traumatic, but I think this story is relatable in a lot of ways. It just makes me see a lot of things differently in every day life. It\u2019s a big eye opener.\u201d #onsalenow at the #linkinbio. #kindle and #paperback versions available! Also for members of #amazonprime, Candy Apple Butterscotch is available in the #kindlelendinglibrary as well as through #kindleunlimitedbooks!

The Crucible_Mary Warren

Good morning everyone, it's #monologuethursday! So many things are going on everywhere in the world, and the hatred that's growing into people is scary. We've been there already not too long ago, and still, looks like we forgot. And one thing that scares me is how, once again, politics is using religion as an excuse to nurture hate and crush other people's basic rights. The war on women's body here in the States, and, a couple of days ago, the hate words spoken against the Pope by Christian Catholics in Italy (yes, you read it right) because of his speech against racism and related racist immigration policies in Italy and Europe in general. It's Chaos. And the whole idea of justifying hate and pettiness and racism and sexism and all hate crimes behind the shield of religion is revolting. We watched The Handmaid's Tale as if it was just a dystopic series, but it's not. The war is real, and we should start stripping those cowards off their "religious" shield and start calling things with their name.

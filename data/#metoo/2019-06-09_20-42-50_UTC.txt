I had taken a career opportunity in Denver Colorado, so when I resigned that is where I was living. -
I knew that something didn't quite feel right inside of me, but I didn't know what it was.  I couldn't put my finger on my confusion and my feeling of not belonging anywhere. -
I couldn't relate to my family, and I had had a falling out with my mom right before I moved so we were barely talking. -
My brothers and sisters visited me in Colorado but I felt like I was viewing them from behind glass.  I was there, but not really there. -
I had so many questions about our past, our childhood, that I didn't even know where to start. -
Driving them to Aspen, and showing them around seemed pointless compared to all the questions that needed to be answered, and all the struggles in my head.

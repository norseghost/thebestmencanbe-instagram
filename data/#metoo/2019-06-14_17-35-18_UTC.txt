I wasn't going to work out today as it's my birthday, but all I could hear was my friend Kristin saying "no excuses." Today I celebrate life. I celebrate with fellow warriors who fight each and every day. I didn't know Laura but I know how devastating cancer can be. How exhausting the fight can become and how torn up and emotional it can be. Feeling hopeless and defeated as we watch our loved ones suffer.
Today I celebrate life. I'm lucky to still be here. I fight every day with illnesses that are not seen. I celebrate the 30 pound loss goal before my birthday. Today I celebrate 47 years of life. Today I celebrate all that I have, all the wonderful, perfectly imperfect things about me.

Today weâ€™re sending love and energy to everyone who has experienced or is at risk of gender-based violence.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
We know how exhausting it is to be at constant risk of harassment, abuse and violence based on our gender. We know how draining it is to be told over and over again that we have to change and overthink our actions to keep ourselves safe. We know how the microtraumas and microaggressions that we experience daily add up. So we hope that being part of our community can give you hope and lift you up when it all feels too exhausting.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Weâ€™re also using the data we collect to change the world around us to be safer for women, so that as women we donâ€™t have to continue changing the way we live our lives to feel safer.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
We would love to hear and understand your story, which will contribute to our global dataset for change. But regardless of whether or not youâ€™re ready to share your story, we want you to know that you are strong and loved, and you are not alone in your experiences ðŸ’•

#Alexithymia? Never heard of it? Don’t worry, your among good company. It’s not a condition that can be diagnosed like depression, anxiety or PTSD but it’s a dysfunction in your awareness of your #emotions which makes answering the question, “how are you #feeling” really difficult. For me, I know I’ve had years of trouble answering that question with non feeling words and my #therapist would remind me to try and use a feeling word. But I would always come back with a description as if I was an observer to the situation. Check out @shape magazines article for more info on this topic and let me know what you think!

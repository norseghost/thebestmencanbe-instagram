i spent most of my night having an enormous panic attack, huddled in the shower with banjo’s head in my lap.

i don’t know who was more uncomfortable. he actually had to reach his body up and over the step, virtually choking himself just to let me know i wasn’t alone.

i could have posted something cheesy like “just keep smiling” or something totally non relevant like “i can’t stop sneezing when I pluck my eyebrows.” i thought about it.

but this is my reality. everyone has something going on that you know nothing about. be kind to them & be kind to yourself.

the grounding technique i use most often is sitting naked in front of my mirror and telling myself that my body is mine, it is not up for grabs, no one is entitled to me & i am worth living. i tell myself that “i am safe” dozens and dozens of times over, even when it doesn’t feel true.

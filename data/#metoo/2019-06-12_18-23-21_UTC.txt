I reach out to touch it without knowing how deep I will go. Will memory come flooding back as though there is no distance in time and space between then and now. I want to be able to say “this is a thing that happened to me l, and while it shapes who I am, it is not defining of me. I am not a victim.” I want to be able to touch it, to draw strength and knowledge from the deep well of my resilience. If I touch the memory of what happened, how deep will I go? I am afraid I will be overwhelmed, taken over by a force that is out of my control, a force that will leave me shaking in a corner afraid and alone. I am afraid I will get lost, swallowed by guilt and shame that should not, does not belong to me. And yet, if I can touch it, know the textures of this memory, understand it’s place in the narrative of my life, learn the lessons it can teach me about myself... if I can control how deep I sink and when I return to the surface to breathe... then I will be more powerful than any perpetrator - for I am a survivor with a story, a hero with a quest, and a mother on a mission - so I reach... the lightest of touches... gently I hold it, the darkness within, to bring forth under the light what meaning I can make.

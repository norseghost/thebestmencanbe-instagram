The divided self: some days I feel happy, centered, grateful… And then other days I struggle with feelings of regret, remorse, and shame… Learning to accept all of myself, the light side and the shadow side, is a constant challenge, but a necessary one. During the dark days, I need to remember to love myself, To give myself tender loving care - the same that I would do for anyone else who was hurting and frightened and feeling utterly alone....I would tell this person that “this too shall pass,” because it will...And each time it passes there is a learning to be gained from it, and in place of darkness comes clarity and new perspectives...Hope is restored once again… The cycle of life continues. #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth #SelfLove #SelfCare #Forgiveness #Compassion #Empathy #Trauma #Healing #WritersNetwork #Poetry#headsTogether#PTSD #WhenThePastIsPresent #ArtHeals #WritingAsAWayOfHealing #Family #Friends #Community #Connection #MeToo #TimesUp#LifeUnfiltered#Common#BringChangeToMind

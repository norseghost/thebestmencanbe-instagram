CW: sexual assault/rape \u201cI Am Not An Object\u201d June 3, 2019\n\nWhy do some people feel the need to voice every single opinion that pops into their misogynistic, pea-sized brains? It is so easy to keep your mouth shut. It\u2019s really a win-win situation. You can live out your fantasies in your dreams and I can continue on with my day without feeling like a total piece of garbage. I\u2019m really not asking for much from strangers, just that they be respectful. I love meeting new people, but my definition of a good first impression is not someone yelling, \u201cDAMN! What I would do to that thang\u201d and \u201cyou were walking on my block... I\u2019m allowed to say my comments for free\u201d at me as I walk down the street on my way home from Starbucks. I DESERVE RESPECT. I am NOT an object. I told the man this exact sentiment from diagonally across the intersection when he told me he was allowed to say his thoughts because I was walking on his street. No. Your freedom of speech is NOT a free pass to sexually harass someone. I shouldn\u2019t have to feel the need to \u201csuit up\u201d in frumpy clothes when I take a walk, yet I do. These kinds of comments have been a recurring, real-life nightmare of mine since I was 11 years old... I\u2019m 23. Over half of my life has been filled with sexual harassment, crude comments, even as far as someone yelling at me, \u201cI WANT TO SHOOT YOUR @$$ UP WITH HEROIN!\u201d Excuse me?!? I am a person with feelings. A person who has had her fair share of trials and tribulations. At 21, my strength was, and continues to be, tested in the most extreme way. Though I will always be an advocate and voice with and for all survivors of sexual assault/rape, I hate that so many people join me in saying, relating to, or silently thinking #MeToo . WE ARE NOT OBJECTS. Don\u2019t treat us as such.\n\n#iamnotanobject #metoo #resist #feminism #bekind #psa #survivor #imasurvivor"

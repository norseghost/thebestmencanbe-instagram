Dear friends, 
When the doctors took me off of the highest legal dose of Valium last December in less than 4 days, my world was completely turned upside down and inside out. The withdrawals were so horrific for me I was unsure if I would ever recover from the brain injury that ensued after 10 years of the doctors having me on a benzodiazepine. But I am here as a voice of hope to say that you CAN and WILL recover from this poison medication. I have survived simultaneous withdrawals from Benzodiazepines, Opiates, Stimulants, Muscle Relaxers, Antidepressants, Nicotine, Urinary Pain meds, Diet Pills, Sleeping Pills, Birth Control Pills, Mood Stabilizers...and the list goes on. I went from living a life filled with chronic pain, deep depression, suicidal thoughts and catatonia from all the drugs, to now being able to smile and even go for a bike ride this morning despite still being in throes of benzo withdrawal. Although I am still struggling both in withdrawal and with PTSD as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and trauma, I am finally seeing light at the end of the tunnel. Our bodies and brains are very resilient, and want to heal. Please remember that as you are healing from whatever it may be. You are all amazing warriors and I truly appreciate all of the support y’all have provided through this journey of healing. Keep going my warrior friends. You are getting better and better every day. 💪🔥🙏🏼

Woke up today thinking about how messed up it is that women are the only species on earth that get told 'you are rebellious' or you are crazy'  for wanting to enjoy the same rights and privileges as everyone else.And sometimes, for expressing themselves.

The only ones who get told what to do and not to do with their bodies,  OR what and how to dress their bodies... The only ones who get sexually assaulted, insulted, bullied, and 'labeled' for dressing a certain way.

So,  I ended up drawing this.
& I believe it's self explanatory. ðŸ‘‘

PS:  Let's women enjoy their  human rights as men do-The same rights that men enjoy... Put an end to double standards. & Stop governing women's bodies. 
This is about basic human rights..let's  stop making it about our individual beliefs. ðŸ’”

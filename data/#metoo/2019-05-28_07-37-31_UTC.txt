Pakistani model Sadaf Kanwal has been slammed on social media for encouraging the body-shaming of women. 
The outrage sparked after Sadaf Kanwal uploaded a picture of model Alyzeh Gabol on a social networking website. In the image, Gabol can be seen holding up her cellphone with a picture of a seemingly over-weight woman. Sadaf Kanwal chose to caption the image as “future”, insinuating that if Gabol could at some point in the future look like the women on the screen.

This isn’t the first time Sadaf Kanwal has been embroiled in controversy. Last year, she questioned the intentions of #Metoo victims. On a show, she said that if a woman is harassed she should “say it then. Why are you remembering it later?” #talkofthetown #sadafkanwal #alyzehgabol #pakistaniactress #showbiz #lollywood #fatboy #fatshaming #lollywood #instadaily

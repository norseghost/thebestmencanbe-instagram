▪︎▪︎▪︎ Trigger warning in advance ▪︎▪︎▪︎ I'm sorry if this upsets anyone, or brings back memories they wished to suppress.

I just want to say, the full body shot picture genuinely  makes me want to cry every time I see it, I can see the pain in my body, I can see how depressed I was, not brushed my hair in a week, the bags under my eyes... The pictures are of me, first one is bruised ribs, second one is a bruised shoulder that I needed medical attention for. Third picture was the aftermath of saying no to sex. And the rest kind of speak for themselves. No one should ever mark your body. No one should make you feel as low as I did

But I am hoping that is can bring some help towards those who need it, and hopefully my story can help heel others.
I know the fear of living in constant alertness wondering when the next time will be. I know how our scars follow to our next relationship, but I also know I can get through this and so can you. . 
Remember we are warriors, what we have gone through is only part of our story.

You are not required to set yourself on fire to keep another warm & do not look for heeling at the foot of those who hurt you. 
If you are going though this seek help, womens aid, RASA, or call the domestic abuse helpline on 0808 802 3333.

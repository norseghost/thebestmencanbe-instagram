                        "text": "The reason I took the red pill\"went mgtow\" is because I think that my value as a man has not been appreciated in society and with women I feel that I bring more to the table than the average woman and Im worth more than to be a womans disposable pawn. Women love men for the lifestyle that they can give them not because im a hardworking, honest and humble man. These qualities women dont find appealing as they once did in the past women have allowed society to mold their ideologies and have corrupted their hypergamous nature women take on the enviornment that they are in and in western culture here in the US a woman can only be as good as her family and hometown that is why the only way a woman will be good is if shes under strict rule of religion such as jehovas witness or Islam where she knows that if she messes up she will stand to loose her family and money and possibly put on violation and kicked out of her religion either that or you have to take her in to nature and into the jungle where there are no outside influences to corrupt her nature I dont like either way because why do you need to be in isolation in nature or have the proverbial sword of religion hanging over your head and thats the only reason your walking upright being a good woman why cant you just be good\ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37 I m a man and I dont need all of these things to keep me straight I do good because its the right thing to do I believe in doing the right thing sinply because im a good guy really women are too lazy and selfish to want to do good. I think women today are all grown children their more of a liability than an asset. If you ask the average man when was the last time you protected a female he can say that day or yesterday but if you ask a woman something that she did good thats assosiated with bring femenine or nice she cant say she cant say thr last time shes given a brother a glass of water or cooked him a meal or simply just said thank you for doing what you do. Im protecting women now and all I get is dirty look like im pose to be doing this and not getting 1 smile yall are very unappreciative. #mgtow #relationships #femenism #metoo"

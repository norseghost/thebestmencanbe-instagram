Hello IG Community,
If you know anyone who may be interested in participating in #ThePantyProject, please share this call with them.  Although I am, at present, engaging this social practice project in North Carolina, I often work with individuals long distance.  The purpose for this work is to help individuals and communities heal from sexual, physical, emotional, psychological, and cultural gendered abuse.

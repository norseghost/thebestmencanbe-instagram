In remaking it’s animated classics into live-action it was inevitable we would see #aladdin sooner rather than later, the problem they had is that more so than any other animated film the cast, or one member of said voice-cast, was thew thing that made the film stand out, the late #robinwilliams #genie marking a real turning point in what actors could do with an animated character, Williams was more than just the voice of Genie he WAS Genie, perhaps one of the Mouse house’s most iconic character &, particularly following the stars passing, one of the most beloved to the point where it seems a folly to try and replace him in any medium.
Where there is a will… there’s a way &, Genie problems aside, Disney went seemingly left-field in hiring #guyritchie to direct, if Tim Burton seemed a perfect fit for #dumbo Ritchie was a baffling choice, best known for his British crime caper roots such as #snatch & #rocknrolla & more recently big-budget flops such as #kingarthur & #themanfromuncle.

Outside of Jasmine, writer #johnaugust (he behind many a Tim Burton film script) worked with Ritchie & give the villainous Jafar a more intriguing motive for his nasty ways, alas it counts for little when the actor cast (#marwankenzani) is far from

As my book has released I have had this anxiety brewing, is it going to sell? Is it going to do well? Are people actually going to want to read this book? But one thing I learned while writing it, while waiting for the man of my dreams to come into my life, while waiting for a job, I had to trust in God’s timing. So even though I don’t know what’s to come, or how well this book will do, I am trusting in God to do what He wills with this book, and I will wait in Him, cause that is all I can do! However, if you are interested in reading my book, if you are wanting to get it, you can buy it in #amazon #itunes #barnesandnoble. If you have read it, share your comments, write reviews, share it with friends. This book’s purpose is to teach you that God can make you bloom into such beautiful people if you allow the space and time for Him to work! #writersofinstagram #blooming #bloomingintobeautiful #bethbasiliocox #writer #create #bestillandknow #metoo #healing #growth #battle #anorexiafight #createandcultivate #published #christian #christianfaithpublishing #findmybooksonamazon #wait #share #loveyourself

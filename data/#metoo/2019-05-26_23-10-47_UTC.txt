Let’s have real talk. I have been asked a lot of questions because people know I’m pretty open about my rape and how it affected some things in my life and I was struggling for long periods of time, there was some days where I literally would go crazy. I thought about burning my mattress, I drank until I could barely function, I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror, and there was so many other things that I struggled with and still struggle. However, I learned to not be ashamed of something that was not my fault and I refused to stay in the dark about something that was traumatic and there’s many woman who do choose to not tell anyone and to be honest; I feel deeply sorry for those woman because if you can’t be honest about what happened to yourself, then you’ll never heal from it. There’s chances  people will call you a whore, ask you “what did you do to make him do that, what were you wearing, you weren’t sober, so it doesn’t count, you’re being dramatic, you’re lying” and so many other things but you know what. That’s okay, because there’s woman out there who do understand and know exactly how you feel. You’re not alone, so when you ask me why I have the courage to speak out about it, it’s because I know it’ll move others and maybe give them more courage than I ever did about reporting my rape and hope they make the choice to. Don’t sit in the dark, stand out, move others and don’t play the victim card because you’re not a victim. You’re a survivor and that’s how you should be looked at. #metoo

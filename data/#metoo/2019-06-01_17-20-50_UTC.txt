Less than 6 months ago I was over 170 pounds. I am currently 125 pounds. I put on 50 pounds being with my abusive boyfriend pimp. I’ve lost all the weight I gained since I left him. I did it without even working out. I’ve been making so positive changes. I am no longer doing drugs, drinking or smoking cigarettes. My taste buds changed and I crave fruits, vegetables and nuts. Healthy foods give me orgies in my pants. 💦🍌And for the first time, in a long time, I feel genuinely happy. Stress will wear on you- I have this Light in me that I’m rediscovering, since I left my abusive pimp and changed my lifestyle. I’m so thankful for all the highs and lows. Being high on life is the best high I’ve ever had. 🌞💖💖💖 I can finally say I LOVE MYSELF. And it took me being in an abusive relationship, aka a prison, to finally learn how to love myself. Whatever you’re going through in life, just know it’s always a blessing or a lesson. But there are blessings in your lessons. Stay strong! 💪 #quoteoftheday #selfies #selfie #happy #happiness #saturdayvibes #selfiesaturday #summeroutfit #motivationalquotes #motivation #depression #metoo #timesup #womenempowerment #empowerment #positivevibes #positivequotes

Recently, it's been "being honest" that has had impact on my life. Being honest about how I feel... to myself. 
Taking time to make space and taking effort to do the activities to create the connection in order to be honest. 
Having the courage to be brave. .
.
.
Finding the words to say my truth outloud.
.
. 
This is what being honest means to me. .
.
I may not always feel great (and were not supposed to), but whether I do or not, being honest about what that feels like.... who can support me, and what I need that support to look like is my jam these days. .
.
Practice. Practice. Practice. 
It IS the work.

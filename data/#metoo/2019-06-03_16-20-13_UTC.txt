Mesmerising and horrendous. WATCH THIS FILM. In order to better understand ourselves, our world, and to help one another and this planet, we must be aware and awake to everything that takes place within it, without compromise. It is our duty to know. From this knowing we can act. From this action change can take place. We are all connected - to each other, to everything, and to this. Joy starring Joy Anwulika Alphonsus, Precious Mariam Sanusi, Angela Ekeleme Pius and directed by Sudabeh Mortezai. Wild Woman is a public service in aid of ending sex trafficking, sexual abuse and all violence/ sexual violence against women. #joy #sudabehmortezai #endsextrafficking #endsextraffickingnow #blacklivesmatter #metoo #protectwomen #endpatriarchy #womenforwomen #intersectionalfeminism #womanism #femaleempowerment #healingsexualtrauma #colonialismtoday #capitalismtoday

When the tusk of a narwhal is damaged, the thousands of nerve endings inside of it pulse in excruciating pain and the animal suffers...deeply, in the raw, fully exposed. .

Because other narwhals know this pain, their deep well of empathy, understanding, and love overwhelms the needs of the injured. The knowing ones rush to the hurting and they take turns placing their own tusks into the broken, exposed bits. They show up, put pressure on the pain, and do only what the messy, complicated, beauty of experience can. They say “me too” and hold the hurting while they heal. .

June is National PTSD Awareness month. You’re going to see this come up. You’ll read horrific stories. You’ll learn about disruptive symptoms. It’s the stuff that swirls inside of me - inside of many of us - constantly. And, by the end of the month, you could be flattened by the weight of what you’ve read and witnessed online. .

Instead of adding to that conversation, I thought I’d tell you a bit about the magic of the sea. .

Befriend a narwhal and you’ll never swim alone again.

Teach your daughters to use their voice. Teach your nieces and cousins and whoever else that will listen. NO MORE being silent. NO MORE just not talking about it. No more going through it silently or putting on a pretty face. Domestic violence is still as prevalent today as it has been for, well, forever. Predators are everywhere. It could be your uncle, friend, your own father. I am a survivor of both. It's time to share your story. It's time for the victims to become the heroes and the abusers and predators to hide in the holes. They are the ones who need to be ashamed. They are the ones who need to be SILENCED. .

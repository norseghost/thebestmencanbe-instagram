What drew me to the Stevie Awards was their highly regarded international recognition for female business leaders and celebration of diversity as a good business principle. This aligned very closely with my own company’s core values as a globally distributed organization.

I also appreciated the fact that the Stevie Awards give both large established brands and smaller, newer businesses an equal opportunity to get recognition for their achievements. Past winners have included Apple, Ford, Procter & Gamble, and Samsung as well as startups just beginning to make their mark. With almost 100 categories to choose from I decided to enter in the category for Female Entrepreneur of the Year – Business Services (10 or less employees) which was open to women who had founded their own companies.

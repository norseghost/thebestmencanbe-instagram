ROSEANNE BARR
has attacked the #MeToo movement, branding the people who have come forward as “hos”. “Well, it’s because they’re hos,” she continued. “Like if you don’t run out of the room and go, ‘Excuse me you don’t do that to me,’ and leave, but you stayed around because you’re like, ‘Well I thought maybe he was going to give me a writing job,’ well, you aren’t nothing but a ho.” AMAZING!

#MeToo
.
My composition #Metoo is the movement of mass public response to a feeling that women carry daily, due to trauma. These histories have shaped our personalities. We endure, persist, recover, and thrive in spite of a lifetime of discrimination, abuse, and violence.
.
This composition shifts from the innocent through violation, loss and chaos, to the cry of pain and anger, into ultimate resolution where the musical voices come together in harmony 💗

Each week I am releasing PDFs of the sheet music to “The Future is Female” for you on my shop 💞

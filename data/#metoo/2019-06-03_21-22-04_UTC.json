                        "text": "Confession:  There is one part of me that dont believe in sisterhood anymore. When I was younger sisterhood was my entire life. I loved all my sisters and had completely trust in them and the safe place we created together. I had their back and I thought they had mine. It was amazing to feel safe and loved in my sister tribe. The  patriarchy was not a safe place to be but I was convinced that together we could  change the world. It turned out that sisterhood works best in peaceful times, when everything is relatively fun and fine. I learned that women could be cruel backstabbing bitches.  That a sister can hurt me and destroy everything in her way like no man can ever do. That it takes just one crazy person to ruin the entire tribe and years of work. I learned that in times of war it was every sister on her own. But there is also a part of me that never stops believing in sisterhood. I cannot stop myself from loving  and connecting with sisters all over the world  with an open heart. I chose to stand up for my sisters and offer my support even though I don't know if they would ever do the same for me. I challenge myself to trust in love and support from every new sister I connect with. I have a dream of peace between sisters... a dream about deep healing in the entire sister tribe so we can stand in our power and hold our ground. I am working so hard to make that dream a reality that sometimes I forget it can only happen if we are all working together for the same purpose. Each and every one of us... my vision is a sister tribe of female  warriors of light ... standing in our power, holding hands, having each others back, making the entire world a safe place to be. ... are you with me?#sistertribe #sisterhood #femalecircle #feminism #safeplace #spiritualteacher #feminist #jennygunay #lightworker #dream #confessions #lightwarriors #lifecoach #metoo"

Shortly after being crowned for the title for Miss Connecticut International in 2017, she competed at a national stage for the Miss U.S. international title.\ud83d\udc51\n\u2014\nThrough this process, she realized she wanted to do more to celebrate and recognize South Asian people in all walks of life. Working in corporate full-time, she founded her @DesiVibesMedia where she celebrates her culture through music and arts and hopes to inspire youth to embrace their identity and truly be themselves.\n\u2014\nThe concept of unity and family did not exist for Krishna until recently. Being the independent girl she is, she always found ways to \u201cfigure it out.\u201d As an introvert, she found a home in her thoughts and the books and movies she indulged in. As a survivor of sexual assault, she found her voice and the courage to speak against the injustices she and many women like her face in society  through #BrownGirlMag\u2019s #MeToo panel. And the sisterhood and love received from the amazing browngirls (shout out to @TrishaSakhuja_Walia) helped her realize the importance of community and unity.\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udcad\n\u2014\nThrough this photo series, @DesiVibesMedia highlights South Asian-Americans from different regions living in Connecticut and celebrate what makes them one. Watch this space to see more. #WeAreOne\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udcab\n\u2014\nConcept: @OfficialKrishnaParekh\nModel: @depsisaint11 , @officialkrishnaparekh \nPhotography: @Jessproutphoto"

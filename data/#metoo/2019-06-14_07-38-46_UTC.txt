I’m finally starting to feel at home in my own skin again. It’s taken almost 2 years, and I still have so far to go but I am grateful to be where I am. 
If I’m honest, sometimes it’s hard not to be angry. Really hard. There was so much fallout that I could very easily be bitter, but I can’t let him have that kind of hold on me. I won’t let him ruin my life. 
That’s why I refuse to stop doing the work until I have recovered every bit of me that was taken, that has been lost or in hiding since that Wednesday in July.

Say that it's wrong! 
The butterflies I'm your stomach will flight high and multiply,
But say that it's wrong,
Your hands will shiver and your heart will quiver,
Your head will spin and you would want to have an escape,like a twin,
You will want to run away after saying it, 
But just wait for a little bit,
Don't call it quits,
Say th
Even when you think no one will listen and you will be showered with criticism,
Even when people will call you names that are victims of political games,
But say that it's wrong,
Because,
No heads will turn,
No kinds will run,
No ears will open
And justice will weaken,
If you don't say that it's wrong! .

A woman’s choices that she makes about her life are solely her own business. If your sense of self is affected by a woman’s life choices (her sexual liberation, how she looks, how much money she earns, how well educated she is) then you must re-evaluate your sense of self. Your sense of self should not be built on other people’s opinions of you or affected by the way they conduct their life. Mind your own business and focus on being the best version of you that you can be.

nearing the end of #asianpacificamericanheritagemonth 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳 i’m here celebrating being a young Asian woman and advocating for Asian representation in media and reminding everyone that the “model minority myth” is not a myth at all (side note: the “model minority myth” affects other POC too, not just Asians), and we still face discrimination and racism daily. (yup, if i had a dollar for every time someone said “your English is so good” i’d have enough to pay for my college tuition).

i got this cool shirt from the Phenomenal Woman Action Campaign (phenomenalwoman.us) where they fight for women’s rights and all proceeds go towards their non-profit partners such as The National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, Native Voices Rising, The Council on American-Islamic Relations, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, and more.

in conclusion: don’t be a racist! don’t be a sexist! #mybodymychoice! #metoo! #loveislove! #erasethestigma! just don’t be an ass! YEAAAHHH!!!!!!!!

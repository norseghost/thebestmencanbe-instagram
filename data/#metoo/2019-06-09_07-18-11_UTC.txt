Breaking the taboo..
.
When I first admitted I’d had a problem with binge eating back in 2017 it took enormous courage. I had to haul myself over the wall of shame and pretend I wasn’t bothered about the ‘what will people think’ vibe going on in my head. .
The thing I couldn’t believe though was how many people private messaged me saying #metoo. They didn’t feel able to write that in the public post though.
.
It’s why I have produced the online programme Break Free from Binge Eating which outlines my own formula that has helped me to stop. .
You might not be a binge eater but I guarantee you will know one. Somebody who #hidethewrappers and feels all of the guilt associated with it.

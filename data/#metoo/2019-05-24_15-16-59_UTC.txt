It’s absolutely bonkers to look back on how far I’ve come. Just a couple of years ago, I went through the darkest months of my life. ⁣
⁣
I had placed all my love and self worth in someone else. He told me that I was absolute sh*t, that I was worthless, that I was going no where in life and that I was nothing without him. When I was put in the hospital from injuries because he attempted to murder me, he blamed me for pushing him too far. He blamed me for bringing out the violence in him.⁣
⁣
I stopped loving myself. I stopped respecting myself. And every single day, I wished I were dead. I felt trapped and alone. I felt like I had no one to turn to who could help me get out and stay out of this toxic relationship. ⁣
⁣
My healing journey has been turbulent, but I’ve grown so much from it. From darkness, my light has emerged and it is shining so bright!!! ✨ Rainbows everywhereeeee!!! 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈 ⁣

I never want anyone to ever feel the way that I felt. You are not alone. Help is available to you. I am here for you. I stand with you. You can and will take back control. You can and will overcome this. You are so worthy and more than enough. You are loved! 😘❤️🙌🏼 ⁣

Feeling a wee bit run down, so I cancelled training this morning to rest and snuggle this one. Learning to read cues, slow down and be kind to myself.

Life is vibrant, dynamic and sometimes demanding to the point of overwhelm. At these moments I inevitably find myself towards the bottom of “the list”. You know the place right?

Self love ... it’s not selfish, it’s not “me first”. It’s learning to say “me too”.
It’s checking in with the soul. Reconnecting to your body + mind to tip those scales back to balance.

Pics from last week. A little walk with this beauty before we launched into our days.
Sun up.
Crisp air.
Much gratitude.

Celebrating the start of the long weekend with putting some final touches on the column @alterityofficial will release next week.

Also, tomorrow I will have a personal piece published in ETC Göteborg - where I will sound off on the discussions surrounding the aftermath of the #metoo movement.

Having opinions on just about everything has always been my thing, for better or worse. In terms of getting my emotional ass kicked - mostly for the worst.

But with a world that seems determined to venture down the shithole: with rapist getting airtime, abortions rights being chipped away, racism and fascism making political headway and civil rights being questioned  I feel like that what used to be just an annoying habit is now a moral obligation.

It’s a moral obligation for all of us to be the vocal opposition to oppression, to stand with those affected, and to show a better way forward.

Even if it’s just through clinking opinions on a keyboard

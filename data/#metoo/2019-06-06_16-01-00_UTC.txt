Make a wish and cross your fingers! We’re taught from the time we are little girls to close our eyes and make magical wishes, then dream about “what if it really comes true?” This thinking has us rooted in the wrong mindset. If we want to succeed and really manifest our ideas into action and results, we have to get beyond the wish stage and get into the realness of what we desire. Roll up your sleeves, write down what you want, and stand tall in the defense of your dream.

Your life is a CHOICE.
You can be a warrior OR you can be a victim.
I choose WARRIOR 💪🏼!
.
I’m about to get real and I’m not doing this for sympathy. I’m doing it to show you that life has thrown me a lot of lemons 🍋 and I chose to make lemonade.

I got robbed when I was living alone in my early 20s.
I was in an abusive relationship...for YEARS!
I was sexually abused in my teens.
I moved from my family for a man who swore to me we were “forever” (forever was 3 weeks).
I had unexplained infertility. I tried everything (Clomid to IVF) to get pregnant. Nothing worked, not even once (but I did discover that I could give myself injections 💉(lots of them) when push came to shove.
My 1st husband and I went through the adoption process. Blood, sweat and tears. We were matched to a woman who was pregnant. This was in Sept. In November (unknown to me), my spouse started an affair. In February (still didn’t know) he called the adoption agency and told them he didn’t want to be a dad. The agency had to call me and tell me the adoption was off and why. Five days later I uncovered the affair. I lost my son (who was to be born in weeks) and my spouse. HARDEST experience of my life.
I lost my mom to cancer 2 days after my 1st wedding.
I lost my dad 3 weeks before my (miracle) baby was born.
I’n deaf in my right ear (happened in my 30s).
My husband has cancer and keeps to himself about it. I almost lost him a couple of years ago. I can’t imagine my life without him.
I was diagnosed with lymphocytic colitis in December after months of suffering with symptoms every day.
.
There was a time in my life that I literally had to talk myself into getting out of bed, opening the blinds and to find the courage to go out in public. I was SHATTERED.
.
BUT I made that choice. I got help. I faced (most) of my demons and I came out stronger 💪🏼.
I came out with an appreciation for the blessings in my life.
I came out realizing that life is what YOU make of it.
I came out realizing I’m a f$cking warrior.
I’ve created a beautiful life. You are worth it...you deserve a beautiful life. CHOOSE it, fight for it, create it!

Three sisters have grown up on an isolated island they’re not allowed to leave. They’ve been told it’s for their own protection because men are dangerous and the world is toxic. So-called damaged women come for “the water cure,” cleansing their bodies of harm from men. Then, their father—their King—disappears, and three men wash up on their shores. It’s a poetic, dark commentary on women’s bodies, trauma, and desire. The writing sometimes felt too vague to give me a clear picture of the place, but the feeling of love, fear, and vengeance was visceral. It’s a discussion-worthy book for the #MeToo era.

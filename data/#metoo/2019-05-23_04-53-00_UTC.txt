Jason Mitchell is one of my favorite actors,I almost had the pleasure of working with him 4yrs ago when we started messaging each other for my stage play "THE LIES THEY TOLD" but he became famous and that was it. I don't know if the allegations about him are true or not. But I will say this if they're just allegations why should he lose his career because of it?...Fellas!! flirting and being attractive to a woman is on a new level nowadays... If she isn't INTERESTED keep it moving! Yes they're some perverted men out there, but Damn not everybody! Some men just don't have a great way of approaching women that can come off distasteful.... But it doesn't always mean sexual harassment.. It can often times be a harmless flirt. But now his career is ruined because all I woman gotta say is you did it and that's it! BROTHERS BEWARE #METOO STARTING SEEM LIKE #BLACKYOU...ijs.....Sorry ladies just my opinion.

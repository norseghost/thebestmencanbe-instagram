WEX is providing a platform for all women to feel empowered and supported to take action on what they are passionate about. ⠀
⠀
For any really change to occur, you need to first recognize the problem and speak on that to create awareness and then you must have the group that takes action to solve those problems. ⠀
⠀
WEX is the second piece of the equation. We don’t focus on what is wrong in society for women like unequal pay or the glass ceiling or the little investment money going to female founders, we bring light to all the success women are having around the world and work to empower you to have that success for yourself. ⠀
⠀
The energy is positive and empowering because we believe that when you feel good about yourself, your dreams, your passion... you take more action. ⠀

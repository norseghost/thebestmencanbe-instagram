If you would like to support our work, whether you are a member of the Vietnamese community or not, we would love to hear from you. Our mission is to raise awareness of the sexual violence that took place during the Vietnam War, help the victims and their families before it is too late and most importantly give a voice to the defenceless Vietnamese women and achieve Justice for Lai Dai Han.

If you have been affected by events that took place during the Vietnam War, we are always interested in hearing your stories.

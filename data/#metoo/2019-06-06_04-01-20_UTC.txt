“Unsafe” abortions involve using dangerous and life-threatening methods to terminate a pregnancy due to the lack of access to a safe one. In less developed countries, methods such as inserting broken glass into one’s genitalia or drinking concoctions made up of live manure were reported. In developed countries, 30 women die for every 100,000 unsafe abortions. Physical consequences of these procedures include hemorrhaging (heavy bleeding), infection, and incomplete abortion (unable to expel all of the pregnancy tissue from the uterus). •

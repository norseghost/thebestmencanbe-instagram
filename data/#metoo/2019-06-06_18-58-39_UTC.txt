Just a week into our June fundraiser and we're just getting started! Your donation will help take us past that first 1% hurdle and provide direct services for local survivors!
.
Please consider donating today at RISEslo.org (link in bio).
.
Since the #MeToo movement took off, more survivors are feeling safe to come forward and get the help they need.
.
Calls to the RISE hotline increased 50%, and our counseling services are in higher demand than ever before.
.
That's why we're asking for your help to raise $20,000 by the end of June. Your gift will ensure victims continue to receive all RISE services for free and in a timely manner.

Please consider donating to help local victims. Any amount helps us toward our goal.

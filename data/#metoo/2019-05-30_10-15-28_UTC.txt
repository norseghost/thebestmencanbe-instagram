This order of DELHI EDUCATION DEPARTMENT is REGARDING "VIKAS KALIA"
THIS VIKAS KALIA WAS TEACHER BUT HE WORKED AS P.A. OF ex- DIRECTORS OF EDUCATION ie "AMIT SINGLA,PADMINI SINGLA ,SAUMYA GUPTA ETC.. THIS VIKAS KALIA NEVER TEACHES IN SCHOOLS BUT HE WAS A TEACHER.HE USED TO DO ENJOY IN DIRECTORS OFFICE AS P.A. BECAUSE ABOVEMENTIONED EX DIRECTORS USED TO COME IN OFFICE ONLY FOR 3-4  HOURS A DAY SO VIKAS KALIA ALSO ATTENDED OFFICE ONLY FOR FEW HOURD A DAY. HE IS CORRUPT PERSON,HE NEVER ALLOW EMPLOYEES & OTHER VISITERS TO MEET WITH DIRECTORS EVEN IN "MEETING HOURS OF PUBLIC". HE ALLOWED ONLY HIS RELATIVES FRIENDS AND TO THOSE PERSON'S WHO GAVE HIM BRIBE TO MEET WITH DIRECTORS. EVEN HE TOLD LIE TO VISITERS THAT "SIR/MAM IS NOT IN OFFICE"-BUT DIRECTORS  WERE PRESENT IN OFFICE, WE ARE EYE WITNESS
HIS WHOLE SERVICE PERIOD IS LIKE" ENJOYING PICNIC" IN OFFICE.
SO WHO CAN PUNISH  CORRUPT EMPLOYEE OF DELHI EDUCATION DEPARTMENT IF HE IS FAVOURITE P.A. TO DIRECTORS. NOW HE IS PROMOTED. WHAT CAN SAY TO DELHI EDUCATION DEPARTMENT. .,IT'S SHAMEFUL. 
WHEN & WHO WILL REMOVE CORRUPTION & CORRUPT OFFICERS OF DELHI EDUCATION DEPARTMENT?
WHO HAS POWER TO PUNISH FAVOURITE CORRUPT TEACHERS & FAVOURITE CORRUPT EMPLOYEES OF DELHI EDUCATION DEPARTMENT.

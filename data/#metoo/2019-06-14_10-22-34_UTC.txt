Ah it appears @sorrelsorrelsorrelsorrel is back at it again with useless, discriminatory content. -
I'm just gonna jump into this -
1) yes it fucking does. If all cops were bastards no one would need to make the argument that "there are good cops."
-
2) this is a very terrible argument. Just because there's other jobs out there that help people doesn't mean there shouldn't be people in other jobs that help people. God damn where does this logic come from
-
3) whether it's part of their job description or not doesn't matter. If they don't do anything they're seen as terrible and I'm pretty sure can get charged with conspiracy to murder. Not preventing a crime while being a cop is illegal, especially if you can easily prevent said crime. Stop treating people in danger as seperate to crimes.
-
4) and you're trying to STOP them from upholding the law!
-
5) what law are you talking about? I can only assume the judicial law, which is quite unjust towards men. Maybe towards others but I'd love to see some proof. If you're talking about street law, as in when a cop arrests someone for doing some wrong, how is that unjust and oppressive?
-
6) you're judging the entire police force based off shitty things like court law.
-
7) you're a bastard too I guess, because you're making content that harms and attacks an entire group of society. Well. Done.

So that was terrible to read.

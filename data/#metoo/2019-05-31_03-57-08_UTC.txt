Voice of the unheard

Maybe there's a people out there that look down on women's.
They think women is just PISS (Pain in the Ass) or something (sorry for the harsh words).
__
But they aren't. They have the same rights as men.
They have the same chance as men too.
__
Gender can't divide us and can't be differentiate how we must be treated by others.
__
We're same. We're equal. We have the same voices that everyone must hear.

After I watch Aladdin's, suddenly I realized that this film is all about gender identity. Even women can be a Sultan, Leader, or anything.

To my friends out there, I'm really proud of you guys. You guys are really incredible.

And thank you for everything.

"I won't be silenced
You can't keep me quiet
Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless, speechless
Let the storm in
I cannot be broken
No, I won't live unspoken
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless"

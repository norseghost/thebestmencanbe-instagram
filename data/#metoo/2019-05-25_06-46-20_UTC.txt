Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women’s Anger by Rebecca Traister ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ A complete force of a read. A totally unforgettable, empowering, thought provoking, infuriating, motivating book. Traister manages to explore and tear through the historical and political path of female rage so brilliantly, at times giving me both goose bumps and making me burn inside... From the suffragettes, to Rosa Parks, to #metoo and the election of openly misogynistic, racist (among many other things) Trump, to the campaign trail and media depiction of Hilary Clinton and Michelle Obama and so much more. How the power of anger drove each movement, how the all encompassing strength of rage managed to make change, how the collective unearthing of female fury got us to where we are today and will continue to make progress towards a more equal world. I don’t think I had quite realised how many glaringly obvious and completely outrageous discrepancies that women face surrounding the topic of anger. Men are seen to be motivating, powerful and strong when they’re angry. Women are seen to be unattractive, shrill, shrieking, grotesque and laughable. Especially when shown through the media. I would urge anyone who has even a remote interest in the world and working towards equality to read this.... I found myself highlighting SO many sections and although it is mainly USA based research, the main findings can most definitely be reflected in the media in the UK. An incredible glimpse through the lens of burning, hot female rage and its power to change the world. #romyreads #nonfiction #goodandmad #feminism #politicalnonfiction #politics #history

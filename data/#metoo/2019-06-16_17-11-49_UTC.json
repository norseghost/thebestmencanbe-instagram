Her story has struck me more then any other I\u2019ve ever encountered in my shop. The \u201cbefore\u201d photo represents her mother who at one time was this girls best friend. This was my clients dedication and tribute to her mom. This woman was supposed to protect her daughter. And let her down by getting back together with the man who sexually assisted her while she grew up as a child. Her mother chose her abuser-and knew about it-over one of the sweetest, most precious and darling people I have honestly ever met. Her relationship with her mother faded, and it was time to stop looking at a reminder of daily hurt. It was time to turn the vicious past into a beautiful bright future with a reminder that she is as bright and wondrous as that beautiful new rose and the stars that shine behind and with it. She never once dropped her smile, was sweeter then a sugar pie, had the most gentle spirit, and was so incredibly...peaceful. She reminded me of why I do my job. That I help people with their legacies while leaving mine. And that no matter WHAT you\u2019re going through, that is is going to be okay. Everyone\u2019s trauma will lead to light one day. We just have to make it through. Thank you A for helping with a milestone moment of change for me and resetting my understanding of what this was all about when I began my job. #metoo #rosetattoo #rosestattoo #rosetattoos #flowertattoos #flowertattoo #floraltattoo #naturetattoo #outdoorstattoo #spacetattoo #galaxytattoo #universetattoo #startattoos #nighttattoo #tattooredo #tattoorework #reworktattoo #tattoocoverup #coveruptattoo #freehandtattoo #brighttattoo #colorfultattoo #tattoosforgirls #femaletattooartist #aztattooer #aztattooartists #arizonatattooer #arizonatattooartist #arizonatattoo"

Today is a strange day for me. (TW: Rape) Exactly a year ago today, my life was irrevocably changed when I was raped by someone I trusted. I only know the date because of the text messages I have from this day. Friends and family have told me not to give him any more power by turning today into a day of mourning, and that isn’t my plan. However, it is impossible to ignore. There is no pretending that today does not mark the end and the beginning of so much. Instead of mourning, instead of sitting in silence, I want to take a moment to acknowledge how far I have come. There was a time not too long ago that I was horribly depressed, constantly fearful, and in danger of coming undone. I don’t think I’ll ever get back to the person I was before I was raped, but the person I have become in spite of it isn’t so bad. That is the key—I am not strong BECAUSE I was raped, I am strong in spite of it. Now, that does not mean I am 100% okay. I still can’t sleep without a weighted blanket. I still have to keep my anxiety meds on hand in case of a panic attack. I still get triggered when I am with partners I trust. It isn’t pretty. It never will be. But I am alive. I am living and loving and writing and being. I’m happy—not always—but I’m getting there. The reason I’m telling you guys this is twofold. 1). Sharing my emotions in writing is a catharsis and 2). I want to tell you that if you stick it out, it does get better. When you’re in the thick of it—whatever “it” is—it is so hard to see the light through the trees. That doesn’t mean it isn’t there, and I promise it is worth the wait. Thank you guys so much for supporting me over this past year. Thank you for making it to the end of this post, and for reading Valkyrie. I’m proud of that little book, and I still can’t believe I wrote it. Anyway, stick around. Stay alive. It is worth it.

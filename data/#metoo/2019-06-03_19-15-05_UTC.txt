This photo is so badass! The days of being silent and allowing ourselves to be treated poorly (by what use to be societal norms) is over. Women are taking a stand for themselves in every area of life and are demanding the respect they deserve. ✨ We are learning, we are growing and we are making a difference in the world by finding our inner strength and supporting each other through this transition. Let’s keep it up! #powerfulwomen #metoo #nomore #respect #healing #empoweringwomen #takeastand #womenbreakingplates  photo by @fabianvideo

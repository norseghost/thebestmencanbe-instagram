                        "text": "Google says Say Anything is Drama/Coming of age but it covers all my bases for a rom com: meet cute, love affair, someone pulls away, grand gesture, happily ever after. What I love the most about Say Anything is the disruption of the typical love story narrative with atypical characters: Lloyd Dobbler forever an icon for girls who yearn for tender hearted romantic men who are bravely vulnerable in their love like Lloyd is w/ Diane. Diane Court \ud83d\udc95 the brain with a body who \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how good looking she is\u201d & doesn\u2019t know how to fall in love while learning that her father is probably going to prison. There is plenty to critique about Lloyd & Diane\u2019s courtship but I won\u2019t. I\u2019d rather celebrate what makes this film special & unique. 1. Tender masculinity: Lloyd never wavers in his love for Diane even when she pulls away. He also never gets angry AT her. He\u2019s hurt. There\u2019s a difference and while I\u2019m not advocating for taking care of Sad Boys it\u2019s a refreshing twist to see a man acknowledge hurt without violence. 2. Lloyd initiates the relationship. This is ever more relevant in the #metoo era where men are using a teachable moment as an opportunity to be worse. To not talk to women. To be scared of being creepy. Here\u2019s what - there\u2019s nothing creepy about talking to women. How are you making it creepy? That\u2019s on you. If all else fails pretend I\u2019m a dude. Oh, that doesn\u2019t work well you probably should change the way you talk to dudes too. 3. Lloyd has friends that are women. Best friends. This is healthy! Men who aren\u2019t friends w/ women don\u2019t like women. TRUST ME. Finally, it\u2019s well written, well acted (JOHN MAHONEY LILI TAYLOR JOAN CUSACK) & timeless. They don\u2019t make men like Lloyd, in fiction or IRL and most romcom\u2019s don\u2019t even pass the Bechdel Test. This film made @vinylcrowe my favorite director for a very long time and my affinity is made more poignant by his relationship with Heart\u2019s @nancywilson who recorded an original song for the soundtrack. They broke up but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f THE SOUNDTRACK. Set in Seattle & filmed in 1989, it\u2019s an entry point into the og \u201cgrunge\u201d scene. \ud83d\udda4 #tbt #moviereview #sayanything #romcom #teenfilm"

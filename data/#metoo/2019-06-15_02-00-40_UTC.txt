Today, women across Switzerland held a nationwide strike to emphasize the importance of gender equality, and to protest the nation’s slow progress on equality. This protest, lasting 24-hours, tackles the overall hardships and systematic discrimination that Swiss women face on a daily basis. Currently, these women are earning 19.6% less than men, a number which is steadily increasing. •

Gender equality is crucial for a better, and sustainable future, as outlined by SDG 5. This demonstration is Switzerland demonstrates the impact that women have and the progress that has yet to be made. As Ursula Keller, professor at ETH Zürich University, stresses "If we don't fight for it we aren't going to get it." •

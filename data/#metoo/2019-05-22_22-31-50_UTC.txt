#Cannes2019 #WCW - ‘There are countless films made by women out there, the question is why we don’t necessarily know about them? 'We have women filmmakers, some of them are working in bars and some of them are in schools and some of them can’t get into the schools that’s where we need to start looking. 'We need to appreciate and buy tickets for films by women.' #Love #tildaswinton #journolife

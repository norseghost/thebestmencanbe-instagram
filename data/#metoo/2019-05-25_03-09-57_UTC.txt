It was my absolute pleasure to create a portrait for @jameelajamilofficial for Stories For South Asian Supergirls.⁣
⁣
Critics may say what they will about @nbcthegoodplace actress Jameela Jamil, but the outspoken advocate gives zero Fs when it comes to talking unrealistic and toxic beauty standards, industry sexism, #metoo, and everything in between. I appreciate her using her platform to question, challenge, and provoke.⁣

“Oh, I don’t care about that. I can’t not say this because then you become a double agent for the patriarchy, which has always been my greatest fear.”⁣

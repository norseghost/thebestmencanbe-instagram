We can get so caught up in trying to manage the situation and avoid anxious feelings that we don’t realise until we catch a break that the environment is so toxic.
˙
Just as we put up with physical discomfort, thinking it will go away, we don’t realise how bad we’ve been feeling until something happens and things become easier, like the first time you can take a deep breath through your nose after having a cold.
˙
Discomfort becomes your new normal until you notice one day that you don’t feel so bad.

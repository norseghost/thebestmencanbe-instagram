From my heart to yours ❤️ Sometimes we forget who the hell we are. Sometimes we lose ourselves dealing with other people. Sometimes we get so caught up that we can’t see what would seem to be so clear. Sometimes we have to fall back, regroup and start over. Sometimes we gotta chin check ourselves! As hard as that may be. Sometimes we gotta Kick our own ass, wipe ourselves off and get back to it! I am here to tell you that you are the shit! You matter! And to go and be where you are celebrated!! Life is too short for anything else! I pray that whomever needed this knows that this was confirmation! God put this on my heart this morning! I love you all so much! Live your best life! Surrounded by Love, Light and healing! All that other shit is a waste of time! The very thing that you cannot get back! ❤️❤️❤️ #lovemovement  #wordstolife #author #playwright #host #brandambassador  #healer #actress #activist #motivationalspeaker #domesticviolence #rape #abuse #METOO

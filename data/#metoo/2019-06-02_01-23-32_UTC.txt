Because society is full of shit, we often find ourselves ensnared by this idea of perfection. Of course, we know this. We know it’s bullshit. But we continue to get wrapped up in this. Stop it right now. Go sit, and tell yourself that there ain’t not ONEEEEE person in this world who is more beautiful than you. you’re hurting and i know because i’m hurting. let’s stop that and fix it. Let’s start healing . .

In fields where nothing grew but weeds 
I found a flower at my feet 
Bending there in my direction 
I wrapped a hand around its stem 
I pulled until the roots gave in 
Finding now what I've been missing 
And I know
So I tell myself 
I tell myself it's wrong 
There's a point we've passed in which we cant return 
I've felt the cold rain of the coming storm
All because of you 
I haven't slept in so long 
When I do, I dream 
Of drowning in the ocean 
Longing for the shore 
Where I can lay my head down 
I'll follow your voice 
All you have to do 
Is shout it out
Inside my hands these pedals bound 
Dried up, fallen to the ground 
But it was already too late now 
I pushed my fingers through the earth 
Returned this flower to the dirt 
So it could live; I walked away now
But I know 
Not a day goes by when I don't feel it's wrong 
There's a point we've passed in which we can't return 
I've felt the cold rain of the coming storm
All because of you 
All because of you 
All because of you 
I haven't slept in so long 
When I do, I dream 
Of drowning in the ocean 
Longing for the shore 
Where I can lay my head down 
Inside these arms of yours 
All because of you 
I believe in angels 
Not the kind with wings 
No, not the kind with halos 
The kind that bring you home 
When home becomes a strange place 
I'll follow your voice 
All you have to do 
Is shout it out!

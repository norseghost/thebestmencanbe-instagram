Rp @zerofoursixeight you have probably heard of Sky.
we were there as the life flooded out of her and her final moments have been shared extensively as a result.
but really, her story is anything from an irregularity. defencelessly convulsing until each heavily abused major organ throws in the towel is the end billions of young animals face in farming units every day — who aren’t even factored into the statistics that ring in our minds.
she died in the arms of activist and veterinary nurse @shakirafree, who describes the conditions we walked into when entering this piggery in Barcelona as no less than “a medical emergency”.
none of this is isolated to a certain country or rearing method. horrors will always occur when you relentlessly farm families for their flesh.
in livid memory of Sky’s mother, 1305. knowing they are out there kills me but being “out there” (read: in there, in those vacuums of terror) is *literally* killing them. #govegan #pig #adaytoremember #adaytoremember #piggie #baconlover #nightmare #pigsofig #ballpark #schnitzel #piglet #piglets #baseballism #hotdogs #piglife #piglove #puerco #hotdog #poorbaby #potbellypig #skinnypig #hamilton #imissyou #impressionism #vegano #metoo #seperation #donttakeourplanetforgranted

Sad but true.

We have a new post on the blog by one of our featured contributors [namasteallday]. She wrote a letter to her mom and in it, she wrote about how she never blamed her mother for anything that happened to her family since her mom was a victim of her father’s abuse too.

I thought that was really powerful. But I’m also saddened knowing that so many abusers have multiple victims in their lifetime.

I’m sure some have too many to count. I know my abusive ex has numerous women across the country who have stories of his abuse.

How many of us have to band together before these abusers see justice? I know so many of us have poured our hearts and our truths out in court rooms, police stations, and hospitals just to see nothing come of it.

I know even more of us have stayed silent because we’ve seen firsthand how survivors can be treated. We know that even if multiple victims come forward, there will still be those who echo chants about how we are looking for attention or how we must be lying since we kept our secret for so long.

I don’t know an answer on how we fix abusers. Some argue that once they’re a certain age, it’s too late for them to recognize the errors of their ways. But I want you to know, that there are people out there fighting for us—making sure that there aren’t more victims, making sure that your story is heard.
Sending love and strength to all of you today. Some days are hard, and that’s okay. It’s just a part of our healing journey. #WeAreHER

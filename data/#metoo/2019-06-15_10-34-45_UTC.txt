Please support @evawuk, myself and other victims of rape get justice in our human rights legal challenge and judicial review against the UK (in)justice system (Crown Prosecution Service (CPS)): https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/justice-after-rape/

In 2014, 1/4 reported rapes were prosecuted by the CPS. Now, only 1/25 reported rapes are prosecuted.

The CPS deny any change in practice, but the statistics speak for themselves, and the CPS can't otherwise explain why their website has removed reference to the Merits-Based Approach, which was the method of assessing rape cases based on their merits (strength of case/evidence). CPS whistleblowers are saying that their public prosecutors have been covertly  instructed to second guess what a jury would think, even if juries are ignorant in their belief of rape myths.

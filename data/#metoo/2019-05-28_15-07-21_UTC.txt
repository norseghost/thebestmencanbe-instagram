Yes, you. Even if your family doesn't want you. Even if that false friend didn't stand by you. Even if that jerk cheated on you. Even if your entire faith community turned on you. You don't have to prove yourself in order to earn acceptance, understanding and respect. Your true friends want you in their lives. Your chosen family wants you. God wants you. #metoo #mentoo #churchtoo #christendomtoo #christendomcollege #mentalhealthawarenessmonth #selflove

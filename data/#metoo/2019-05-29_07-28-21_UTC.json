Other women can learn from you. It will inspire them to believe they have the power to reach their goals too. \n#2. Stand up for women\nWhen you see discrimination, unacceptable behaviour or an unequal playing field, call it out. Report it. Don\u2019t worry about developing a reputation for rocking the boat. It is something to be proud of. \n#3. Share opportunities\nWe need to work together to promote ourselves. Look for and recommend women who would benefit from an upcoming opportunity and recommend them. Collaborate with other women. Keep in mind women who are further marginalised and disadvantaged.\n#4. Encourage other women\nEncourage women to put up their hands for new opportunities, to apply for promotions, to ask for training, to seek mentors and be mentors. Hold other women\u2019s hands, encourage them, give them a push when they it, and keep reminding them of their talents and abilities. There are a lot of people who find it easy to pull others down. We need to be the people to help them climb.\n#5. Build your network\nLook for women who are positive, encouraging, strong and determined to help other women succeed. There\u2019s strength in numbers, especially emotional strength which you\u2019ll need at some stage to help you keep standing up for yourself and other women. Build a strong network both at work and outside and stay in touch. \nWe need each other. The more we work together and support each other, the more we\u2019ll be heard. Your age, your role, your experience \u2013 none of it matters.\nYou can start empowering other women right now. Don\u2019t let anything hold you back. You are needed.\n#empowerwomen #supportwomen #speakup #mentor #sponsore #lead #recommend #encourage #fightforinclusion #sisterhood #inspirationalquotes #womenwholead #womensupportingwomen #genderequality #fightfordiversity #saynotisexism #metoo #saynotoharrassment #findyourtribe #womeninleadership #timesup #mysisterskeeper #womeninbusiness #haveeachothersback #supportotherwomen"

Thank you @MamaMiaAus for this important editorial commentary and for including our work.
These attacks were able to happen because white men built a society where they are never held responsible for their actions and the harm they inflict on those with less power and privilege.
As a result, most forms of violence go unchecked and unaddressed, primarily violence against non-men.
The only domestic terror threat facing Australia is the majority of entitled white men who misuse their power and privilege to avoid accountability.

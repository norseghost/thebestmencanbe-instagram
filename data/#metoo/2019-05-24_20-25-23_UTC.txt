~I am loved regardless of my âœ¨flawsðŸŒƒâœ¨~
Having to tell myself that I am beautiful and what happened to me isnâ€™t my fault is hard. Iâ€™m still a victim because I havenâ€™t learned how to control myself yet, but Iâ€™m willing to after this very hard year. I been to the hospital twice for being suicidal and on top of that having ptsd. I want to make a video of me explaining what happened to me and maybe that will help me grow as a human and shape me into what I am meant to be. #iwasforced #iwasmolested #metoo #iwasassultedtwice

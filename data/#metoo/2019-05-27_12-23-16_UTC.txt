âš«Discriminationâš«

As a society the first wrong step we take is to discriminate. At some point in life we all have gone through the point where we were called out names such as choti, moti, kaali etc.....
.
.
. Why do we discriminate on the basis of appearance. 
Is height, weight, color all that matter??
.
.
.
Just coz I am short doesn't mean you start calling me choti or tiddy or any such names.. Do you have any idea what I am going through... Do you have any idea that I might have some medical problem or such...
.
.
Just coz I'm fat doesn't mean you call me Motii or bhalu or anything...
Just coz of these words I am starving myself.. Do you realize??
.
.
Just coz I'm not attractive with a beautiful skin to flaunt you can't call me black... Beauty is not from appearance it is the soul...
.
.
You might just be joking but it is depressing to the other.. I'm sorry but you are mentally abusing and harassing the other
ðŸ›‘ STOP ðŸ›‘ 
CAN WE PLEASE STOP CALLING NAMES... NOT EVEN FOR FUN!!!! THIS IS NOT FUNNY..
.
.
.
I'M NOT LAUGHING!! NO ONE IS!!

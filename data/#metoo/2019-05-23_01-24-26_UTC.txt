Talk about God making your wildest dreams come  true. 🙌🏼
Not long ago, I was asked by a major TV network to share my journey of overcoming cancer. I agreed and traveled to their studio to shoot a 30-minute special about my story.
🙌🏼
I am SO excited to let you guys in on this little secret and give you the official airing details! ❤️
Mark your calendars!! My special will broadcast on TBN (Trinity Broadcast Network) on Sunday, May 26 at 2 PM EST/11 AM PST and again on Sunday, June 3 at 9:30 PM EST/6:30 PM PST. 👏🏼
If you watch it, you'll also get an exclusive opportunity to order a print copy of my brand new book BEFORE it releases to retail, "How I Beat Cancer." ❤️
This project has been a labor of love, so I hope you find much value in both the TV special and the new book. Can't wait to hear what you think!! Tag someone you know who needs to hear How they can Beat Cancer and ultimately PREVENT IT!

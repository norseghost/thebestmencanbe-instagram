Survivor, poet, memoirist & activist Maya Angelou died 5 years ago today. .
.
.
Angelou, who raped by her mother‘s boyfriend at age 8, knew first hand the power of her words.
.
.
.
When she revealed the name of her rapist he was later found beaten to death.
.
.
.
Angelou stopped speaking for 5 years, “ I thought, my voice killed him, and then I thought I would never speak again because my voice would kill anyone.”
.
.
.
It was a beloved teacher  who helped her speak again at age 13 by introducing Angelou to poetry.
.
.
.
Angelou once said, “at our best, we are all teachers.” 💜

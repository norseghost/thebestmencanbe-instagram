I am honored to be speaking at Missouri Missing And Unidentified Person's Awareness Day for the 3rd year in a row on JUNE 8TH.  There is nothing more tragic than the loss of a loved one..to not know where they are or if they are even alive is undeniably a nightmare.  To hear the heartbreaking stories from those in attendance rips my heart wide open. Their reality of not knowing where their child/loved one is truly is devastating. 
Fighting against child abuse and trafficking is definitely an emotional one.  It's very hard to stare evil in the face, but it's a fight we have to face. Children go missing each and every day. 
I hope you can join me June 8th to learn more about how we can make a difference in this cause!

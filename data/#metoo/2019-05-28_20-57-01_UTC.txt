“When I was 12 years old in Mexico City, a man leaned his body against mine in the subway. I did not understand what was happening. When we left the carriage, the guy waited for the person looking after me to look away, then he cornered me against the wall, put his hand behind my backpack and grabbed my buttock. I felt disgusted, and I didn’t understand why this had happened. No one had warned me about this type of situation, nor had I defended myself. I understood what rape was. I had been educated about being touched in private spaces, but nobody warned me that public transport was one of the places with there is the most sexual violence against women. People assured me that rapists were ‘weird’ types of men, ‘sick’ or called them ‘monsters’. But the guy that touched me was young and he looked normal, like anyone else.”

On May 22, the governor of Alabama signed a bill which almost completely bans a woman from getting any kind of abortion procedure and bans a doctor from performing one, even in special cases. The Alabama Senate passed the bill with a 25-6 vote. The bill was introduced in the Alabama House of Representatives at the beginning of April, and it outlines the potential consequences for Alabama doctors performing abortions: up to 99 years in prison. •

Perhaps most chilling is the fact that other states seem to be following suit: Kentucky, Ohio, Mississippi, Georgia, and Missouri have all passed “heartbeat” bills, which could prohibit abortion procedures after just six weeks of pregnancy. It is important to note that all these bills potentially affect not only women, but trans men as well. The ACLU has filed a lawsuit against the abortion law, arguing that it violates the Roe v. Wade decision and will disproportionately affect women of color. •

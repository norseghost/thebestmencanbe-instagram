The singer, 32, denied the attack after a concert in Wolverhampton in December 2016.

The ex-boyband member's tour manager Jamien Nagadhana, 32, was also found not guilty of sexual assault and assault by penetration.

Prosecutors alleged Mr Williams, of Croydon, south London, "jumped on the woman" as she looked for her phone.

During a nine-day trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court, Mr Williams said he met the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and two friends at a meet-and-greet event at a nightclub.

He said they then engaged in consensual sex in his hotel room, but this ended in embarrassment when he was "unable to perform" sexually.

But Mr Williams said she had asked to spend the night with him and also thanked him when they parted company.

Mark Cotter QC, defending Mr Williams, suggested the accusations against the singer were influenced by the "extreme reaction" of the complainant's friend after being told of the consensual encounter.

He said there was "no realistic answer as to why he [Mr Williams] would do it". Jurors deliberated for about two hours before Mr Williams and Mr Nagadhana were unanimously acquitted.

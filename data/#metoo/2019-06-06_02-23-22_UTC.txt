.
I was a child.
You were a man ...
at least by definition.
I was looking for validation
not an anatomy lesson.
But it was never about me.
Was it?

You sated your lust
full of yourself,
me full of you.
Love grew.
Rape?
But I never said no.
Statutory rape?
If only I knew.
what this fire
would drag me through.
Consensual rape:
rape by manipulation.
That’s it.
Consensual statutory rape.
It’s a mouthful
but true.
Love grew.
Part of me + part of you.
How can such beauty
bloom from you’re deceit?
I don’t know but she’s perfect 
unlike you + me.

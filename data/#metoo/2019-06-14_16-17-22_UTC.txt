Bushwick was awash in wheatpastes. I saw a half dozen from the Colombian @lik_mi Mi (is it LiCk Me or LiKe Me?). She, according to @wdwlls is "influenced by yoga and Kama Sutra teachings is curious about the topic of sexual taboos and creates work in a playful, child-like" disarming style. The first one is a saucy pin-up vandal and a sly Disney-esk wolf whistle character slavering behind, but the second, a self-portrait as a cat burglar is stealing away a great bag of what? I am a crusty old feminist so it took me a while to get used to women artists creating sexualized titillating works with semi-nude characters - a domain dominated by men creating soft-core porn works - especially in this trigger happy #metoo era. But @judy.chicago filled a room with 39 vulvas and @MarilynMinter creates sex positive works encouraging the return of pubic hair, so I need to blush and get over it. #citygraffclass19s IG 10

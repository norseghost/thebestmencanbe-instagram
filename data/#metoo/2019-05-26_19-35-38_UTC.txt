Indigenous communities are literally treated like shit in Canada, the US, Israel occupied-Palestine, and Australia, and yet people just brush it aside. Their homes were taken from them, and now they’re expected to live and survive in a world that seems to be doing whatever they can to make them assimilate into society. It’s very sickening and I hope that we’ll eventually treat the indigenous communities of these areas with much more respect, and allow them to live peacefully the way they want. (Also, if I got something wrong or am missing something, and you’re indigenous and want to educate me more, please do because there’s so much that I’m unaware of)

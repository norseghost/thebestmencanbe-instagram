When I was 11 years old, I was sexually abused by a family friend. I spent years fighting everyone including myself because I stopped seeing my value. I was broken and honestly it was not the only time I was exposed to abuse.

For over 20 years, I struggled to see who God created me to be. I carried a nasty secret and a huge dose of shame everywhere I went. Even though, I tried to work through some of the layers... self destruction was a lot easier.

Last year I went back to the place where everything started, where my brokenness began, and I convinced myself it was a healing trip. But, instead it was a triggering trip. So, I did what I do best - obsessed about changing who I am! I became obsessed with fixing myself. I was determined to be someone better but I failed. 
BUT GOD! ðŸ’–

I realized the problem was deeply rooted in my self reliance. I didnâ€™t invite God in the depth of my healing process... but He gave me another second chance.

Iâ€™m happy to report that as time continues to heal all wounds; I am much different now than I was when this picture was taken in February 2018.

Today, I have a God-confidence Iâ€™ve never experienced before. Iâ€™ve learn who God created me to be. Iâ€™m ready to help women who had experiences similar to mine understand; they are valuable, their experience is not who they are, and they deserve love & respect!

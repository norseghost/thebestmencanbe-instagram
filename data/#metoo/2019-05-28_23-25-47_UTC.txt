This is my "a change gon come" post. I have work to do and as a lawyer I have to check the boundaries of the advice I give. I am now in a new chapter in my life where I can file a document and make people accountable for their actions. I am figuring out how to use this tool for the seriously mentally Ill and their caregivers. That accountability works two ways. I am also accountable for the advice I give. Up until now I was just a big sister trying to change the world. Now I am responsible for the advice I give. I don't think of the harm to myself, I think of you. The many people people that have reached out to me over the years. Muslims overseas looking for a therapist that skypes, men that just needed a safe space to be vulnerable and women that needed representation! It has been lovely. I thank you for trusting me. You may still DM me at any time. Warning, I will have to personally get you to say that you understand that I am not giving legal advice - yeah kinda creepy- but after that we can talk on a 1 on 1 level. I will keep you updated on the work I'm doing. Maybe I'll figure out how best to connect at some point. Until then....Only Good Things. .

In the picture is an attempt by a festival goer to protest against OML, while it was reported that he was made to remove the placard by the security and crew later during the evening.
Even as the parent company of NH7 Weekender, OML, was marred in controversy with various sexual allegations against the senior members in the organization, NH7 Weekender proceeded as usual. Thousands upon thousands of fans attended the festival with no idea who OML was or what had transpired at the company. Various voices online urged people to boycott the festival while dictating the artists to take a stand and drop out of the lineup. Artists did not agree on the approach, except for two (Azadi Records crew and Disco Puppet who announced their stand and dropped out) and proceeded to play at the festival which saw the biggest audience ever in the last edition. The festival is gearing up for its 10th edition this year.

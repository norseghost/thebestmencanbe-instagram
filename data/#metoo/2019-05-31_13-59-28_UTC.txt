E N E R G Y  H E A L ✨ FREE WATERFALL MEDITATION to wash away the pain so you can stay present in the lives of loved ones, when you sign up @ www.realbeautiful.ca. 💗💗💗💗💗‘The time for those that escape is not as long as for those that wait’ Are you ESCAPING from the pain? It is REAL that people learn to dissociate from the loss and challenges life brings. It is understandable why. Everyone just wants to FEEL GOOD. But the truth is, if you know you are pushing the ‘hard stuff’ under the carpet, you may be withdrawing on a neurological level that is becoming a pattern that your body follows automatically. It impacts your ability to problem solve, and energetically discharge these experiences from your physiology.  You may not realize that you have been ‘missing in action’ from the lives of those that love you.  What have you done to discharge the energy of abuse, grief, & the other traumas that have happened to you.  Do you even know how? It is difficult to know in a world that has never taught us. #newknowledge Just decide today you will UNDO THE DAMAGE and heal so you can be there for those that love you.  EVERYONE has to do their own work. Check in with yourself. Are you facing the challenges of life, or ‘escaping’ them? Let’s get started together with the FREE #meditation offer above. When you listen to the Waterfall Meditation, think of a situation you are ANGRY/SAD/FRUSTRATED about and help it to wash away. Over time, the energy of the pain dissolves, and YOU can BE YOU again for those that love you.

Planned parenthood provides so much more than just abortions. Only 3% of all the services they provide is abortion. Is it worth shutting down an organization that only 3% of all they do is abortions? They have so many services and are an incredible resource. If anyone needs STD/STI testing or treatment or wants birth control they can help you. They can help your get what you need affordably and if your under 18 they won’t go and find your parents. It’s completely confidential and safe.

With this #foldingfan I was inspired by #Babydollpyjamas. Actually totally not #MeToo worthy. As in those pyjama’s women were dressed up as baby’s. Still, as the #younggirl I was at that age, I felt as a #princess wearing them! So, this fan is for a beautiful morning, waking up, having breakfast in the garden…sleepy, happy and #play-full. Or, when you are grumpy, to get you in this #mood.

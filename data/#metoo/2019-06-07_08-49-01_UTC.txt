The problem with privilege⠀
⠀
Privilege does not mean you’ve lived a charmed life. There are more innate factors at work here; it is the influence of your race, class, sex, gender, sexuality, physical ability on your social standing.⠀
⠀
Checking your privilege means understanding and recognising that certain categories of self in society bring with them certain advantages – greater (or given) opportunities in education, financial stability, employment, leadership etc.⠀
⠀
Nonetheless, the concept of privilege makes people feel uncomfortable. Why? Because it involves turning the spotlight on oneself.⠀
⠀
In acknowledging privilege, you’re also gaining awareness of how hierarchies are upheld, and how your attitudes, actions and views are influenced by the advantages gained through the social categories in which you belong – could you be inadvertently contributing to injustice or passively accepting injustice, allowing for it to continue to exist?⠀
⠀
As a result, being told to “check your privilege” can be seen as accusatory. The reaction to which is either to fight back with examples of your own experience of injustice – a tit-for-tat inequality tug-of-war if you will – or to withdraw from the conversation altogether or discard the concept as a passing craze. Indeed, online privilege calculators and quizzes aren’t helping matters here.

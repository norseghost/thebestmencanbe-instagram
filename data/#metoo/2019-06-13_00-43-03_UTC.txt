The team at Stay Alive Inc. would like to highlight the girls over at the @epsilonkkg sorority of Illinois Wesleyan. They made a generous donation to our nonforprofit and we couldnâ€™t be more grateful! By donating, they provided a great runway for us to take off on our mission to continue to build a platform for others to find their breakthrough. Visit our website for more info on how to help our cause!

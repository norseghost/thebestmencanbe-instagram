This is the argument for abortion. "but what if your sister was raped??" here you can see that rape accounts for <1% of abortions, (at least in Florida and that study in 2004) yet that's what the "pro choice" argument uses as a crutch 🤔 the VAST MAJORITY of abortions are carried out because having a baby would inconvenience the mother. But you KNOW that's a selfish argument, so you don't use it. I believe that all human life is valid- and has a right to LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Regardless of race, gender, age, religion, etc, OR how developed it is. You try to justify it by calling it "terminating a pregnancy" or saying "it's just a clump of cells" but if that's the case then why are women who miscarry so traumatized? 🤔 Y'all are all for equality when it benefits YOU or makes you feel good about yourself, but the minute it inconveniences you or makes you question the decisions you've made, then suddenly some lives are less valuable than others? Sounds pretty bigoted to me 🐸☕ but what do I know, I don't even have a uterus 😫

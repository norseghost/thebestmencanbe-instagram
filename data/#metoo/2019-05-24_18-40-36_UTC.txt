How deep and genuine is your relationship with yourself? How much can you connect with your own feelings? How much support and encouragement are you able to rely on from your self? 
When I am having trouble with my relationships with other people I look at how I am treating myself. Did I neglect my own needs and boundaries? Am I expecting someone else to give me something I'm not willing to give myself. Did I loose connection to feeling my own feelings or respecting my own limitations.

We can only be as genuine and loving with others as we are with ourselves. Start there first.

Started the weekend finding my balance. .
Balance for us busy folks can be hard. Whether you are a momma and running around with your kids and work - or - you are a busy bee who loves their work and staying busy. .
Balance can be hard, but finding balance is so important for our own sanity. More importantly finding time for YOU; doing something you enjoy for at least an hour can truly make a difference in your mood for the day, which will then radiate to those you surround yourself with. .
A big thanks to @twogingerstavern and @erinm.thomas with @themindfulnestyoga for coming to #cascadeiowa and leading a wonderful yoga session!

Heroines of Avalon and Other Tales &  Legends of the Grail: Stories of Celtic Goddesses

In the #MeToo Era, Women Take Strength from the Divine Feminine Essence Passed Down in the Legend and Lore of the Celtic Goddesses and Heroines 
Ayn Cates Sullivan Brings a Scholarly, Yet Spiritual, Recounting of the Powerful and Inspiring British and Irish Female Mythological Figures that Sustained Cultures and Still Resonate Today With Those Who Wish to Live in Harmony with the Earth

In times of yore, their presence was seen and felt everywhere in the Natural World...They spun the moon, made flowers grow and springs gush forth. They were the natural allies of the both animals and man. They had the magical powers that created whole peoples, and brought forth light. But they were often undermined, under attack and coveted by powerful figures and forces...And yet they rose strong and powerful, even when it required great sacrifice.

They were the Celtic Goddesses and Heroines whose stories have been kept alive for hundreds—if not thousands--of years, and who have inspired women throughout the ages to seek and take sustenance from the Divine Feminine, to nurture themselves and their feminine essence in the light cast by these figures. And to honor the balance of nature.

For my final major project; I chose to do a speech & a contemporary dance on slut shaming & sexual assault/rape. This is something I am very passionate about because I got slut shamed in high school & I wanted to speak out for young girls/women ✊🏽, who may be going through these lies. Now regardless if it’s LIES or NOT ❌no woman should be shamed for what they decided to do with their body or what they decide to wear🤷🏽‍♀️. I will be posting some videos from my play ; stay tuned !  #slutshaming #stopslutshaming #awakening #metoo #metoomovement #letstalkaboutit #likesforlikesback #rapevictim #rapesurvivor #explorepage #viral #feminist  KEEP YOUR HEAD UP & KEEP SMILING ❤️

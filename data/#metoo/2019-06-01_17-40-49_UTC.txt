You ain't gonna hide who you are tonight
No, take your time
We can move slow, with your hips on mine
Hey, you're so shy
Won't you come 'round here and waste my time 'cause all that I want is you

I just wanna see you
You could come over
I know you're shy
You can be shy with me
You know I need you
And I'm not quite sober
I know you're shy, baby
You can be shy, it's alright.

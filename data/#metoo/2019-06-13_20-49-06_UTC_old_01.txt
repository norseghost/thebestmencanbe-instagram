“Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,” by Terrance McNally (Broadhurst Theatre). First staged in 1987, a man (Michael Shannon) and a woman (Audra McDonald) have just made noisy, vigorous love on her pull-out couch. They’re coworkers: he is a short-order cook and she’s a waitress at a Greek diner, which makes it awkward. But he’s acting even weirder; keeps praising her, wanting to stare at her body and smell her and rifle through her purse. He doesn’t seem willing to leave. In the age of #MeToo, Terrence McNally’s 1987 play actually seems quite involved. Sex already happened between Frankie and Johnny; it’s in the quest for intimacy that things get rough. McNally navigates the sexual policies of his losers-in-love hit with exquisite verve and sensitivity. 32 years later the play’s emotional terrain is fresh and exciting - and evergreen. These aren’t triggered college kids; they’re older blue-collar and damaged; and while we root for them to fall in love, we also may worry - as Frankie does -that Johnny may be dangerous. #bethsorenson #thenewyorker #june102019 #june172019 #thetheatre #lovestory #terrancemcnally #ageofmetoo #vinsoncunningham #michaelshannon #audramcdonald #frankieandjohnnyintheclairdelune #broadhurstthestre #1987 #justmadelove #pulloutcouch #coworkers #shortordercook #waitress #greekdiner #questforintimacy #sexualpolicies #losersinlove #32yearslater #2019

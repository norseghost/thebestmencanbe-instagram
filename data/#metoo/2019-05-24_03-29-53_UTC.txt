Shakespeare in the Park's Much Ado About Nothing was absolutely PHENOMENAL, very likely the best adaptation of the show I've seen. Kenny Leon directed an all-black cast and set it in modern-day Georgia and it worked SO, SO well, the timeless themes of the show packing even more of a gut-punch when filtered through the lenses of #blacklivesmatter and #metoo. Danielle Brooks (Orange is the New Black) led the cast as Beatrice and was serving up some serious #blackgirlmagic with her charisma, grit, and amazing vocal chops. (Yes, the found ways to let her sing, as well as some other cast members!) The entire cast had perfect comedic and dramatic timing and balanced the two ends of the spectrum perfectly. Lateefah Holder was a positively delightful Dogberry as well!

Incredibly, the rain held off until we went back to the car...a beautiful night and some beautiful and powerful theater. Go see it (it's free!) before they swap over to Coriolanus in July!

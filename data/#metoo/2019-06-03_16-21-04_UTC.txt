ROSE MCGOWAN
I had to cover my exhausted eyes ðŸ‘€ ðŸ•¶ ðŸ˜‚
Rose McGowan is an actress, author and activist. As a child, I loved her as Paige Matthews on 'Charmed' (and Tatum in 'Scream' ðŸ˜±). Now, I respect and admire her for her activism. Whilst in her prime, she sacrificed her career to expose Harvey Weinstein, the King of Hollywood; her fight predated the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. Yet, even now that Weinstein is standing trial, she remains blacklisted from Hollywood. But that won't stop her from fighting the good fight. She truly is #BRAVE. Listening to her tell her story was incredible, and Sam Baker (former editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan UK and Red) made a great interviewer.

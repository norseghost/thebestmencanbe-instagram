I’m having a hard time reeling it in for this space that I’ve created. True and authentic but definitely PG. I found my voice, a different voice. One capable of exposing all of my hardest truths and the scars that years of trauma has left behind. And I can do it from a faceless account. A new space that I created for this purpose. To share the most explicit parts of my story without anyone feeling personally connected to the trauma I’m divulging. It’s my life but it’s art, it’s poetic. No one is offering sympathy or condolences, there is no one to say, “I’m so sorry” or “You didn’t deserve that.” These are all things I know.
.
That isn’t what I need. I need this. This separate healing place, one that offers release and light into the darkest recesses of my mind. A place where someone can identify to the words and find solace in a darkness that their soul has occupied too. But this new space is more an act of self love than selflessness, it’s more for me. This space is more for you.

So if you find more time elapse between posts, try not to worry. Just know that I am learning how to love myself better. I am opening old wounds because they’ve never healed. I am bleeding out years of suppressed trauma through the tip of my pen and it’s no longer ugly, it’s an ugly truth that is becoming a beautiful piece of art. I will no longer be the gatekeeper for the secrets they created. I will be free.

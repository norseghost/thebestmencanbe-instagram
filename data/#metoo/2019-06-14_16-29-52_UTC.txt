Happy #feministfriday
Like many women, I often find myself at a crossroads between: standing up for myself {defending my character and my values} and staying silent {choosing the path of least resistance and, for whatever reason, shame & judgement}. Recognizing this as a weakness, I’m working on standing strong and confident when making these decisions, and respecting myself and my choices to take either path. I hope you will, too💋💋🖖🏼

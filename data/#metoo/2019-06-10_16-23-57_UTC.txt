Spent the last two days with the amazing Laid Back crew (and the Miller Family!) on the 2019 Hot Rod Power Tour (zMax Speedway, Concord, NC and Martinsville Speedway, Martinsville, VA)! A HUGE thank you to Laid Back for using their poker run to raise funds for Family Safety Network. Many many THANKS!

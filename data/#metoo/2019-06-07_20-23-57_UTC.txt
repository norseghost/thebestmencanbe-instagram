to the quiet girls, start using ur voice. itâ€™s time to start speaking up and out about whatâ€™s happening behind closed doors. start the conversation and keep it going weâ€™ve already been silenced for too many years. i hope you all enjoy this piece, itâ€™s very personal for me but also necessary for others to hear who might be in a similar situation or dealing w any type of abuse from family, friends or partners. this was my first published piece in a newspaper for the #metoo movement and i will never stop sharing my story. thank u all for listening and the feedback and supportðŸ’šðŸ’ši feel that love and trust me i appreciate it more than anything ðŸ’š i love you and you should love you too.

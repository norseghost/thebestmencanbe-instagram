You don't owe anyone a relationship in your life (generally speaking, and) if they have abused or harmed you, even if it is a former partner, parent, or caregiver. For some folks that means choosing to have a boundaried relationship, for others it means estrangement, and for many it means struggling with complex and conflicting feelings about how to, when and what boundaries to set. There is no right or wrong process or way to relate to someone - do what works for you. Your well-being, health, healing, and survival are important. ⠀

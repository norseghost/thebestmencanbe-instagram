Soooooo yummy. Cleanest store bought 'bread'. Santa Monica Co-op as well as their sister store in Culver City are the only places I have found this product and the 25 other incredible products by this company in Southern California. Both stores have plenty of them which is great! Northern Cali
biggest selection is Good Earth in Mill Valley and Good Earth in Fairfax. In addition to the bread I depend on the Italian Herb Crackers as well as the Beet Chips xo

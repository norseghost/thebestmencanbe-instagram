It needn't be specified that there are relevant situations in my life that are in our socio-political spotlight. Too often I think they can be seen scaring the heart on my sleeve. Working with the MakeShift Circus Collective's performance, that will be on the boards this weekend, has brought a new realisation to my experiences.

My stories have an unusual bent and are shaded in subterfuge from others involved, but they are no less valid.

Going into graphic details about the physicalities that brought on the crushing mental and spiritual issues that still cling to me is not necessary to know when I fight. The way I fight is not to be condemned either, it does not hinder my effectiveness. My active silence as a weapon is chosen and honed in purpose. When I do speak, you will know what lies behind it. You will feel as I have felt. Because this is war.

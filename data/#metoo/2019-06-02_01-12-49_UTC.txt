Ode to the woman I once was. I have compassion for you. You. With your blood red blinders on. Believing the stories they told you. Upholding the status quo. Ring on your finger. Man to love you. Winning at The American Dream. Knowing no other way than to twist yourself into a heteronormative box that would never fit. A box that you know now never existed. Head in the sand. Blind to The Truth. Blind to the fabric that holds The Dream together. But now you See. Now you know The Truth. And you canâ€™t unsee The Truth. I have compassion for you. And sadness for you. And love for you. Compassion. Sadness. Love. All wrapped up in a neat blood red bow. . . .

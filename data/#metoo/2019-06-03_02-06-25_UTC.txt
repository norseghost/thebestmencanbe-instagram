I don’t know any woman who doesn’t have a # metoo story. From an unwanted look, gesture, touch, comment to sexual assault.  Come join us to create a very large community piece of art made of our #metoo stories.  Create a container for our stories and a visual impact for our shared outrage. Together we create. Together we heal. Together we change the culture and create new stories.

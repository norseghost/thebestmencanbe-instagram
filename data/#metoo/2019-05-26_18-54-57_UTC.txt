A bittersweet morning as we attended our last church service as a family. The kids and I leave this week, and @lt_meyer will join us in July. This place and the people will forever be in our ❤️. Luke said at the end of the service, as he put his head on my shoulder, “I’m really going to miss Acts 2!” #metoo #churchfamily #acts242 #militarylife #finalmove #airforceretirement

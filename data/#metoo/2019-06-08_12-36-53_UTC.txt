My name is Talia Mingey and I created this Survivors Writing Workshop Community because writing saved my life. I was the victim of two sexual assaults in college. Finding my voice proved very difficult and poetry seemed like a good place to pour my extreme emotions into. I never knew how much this simple act could help and become my number one outlet. Every time PTSD got the better of me, Writing was there. Every time I became suicidal, I just kept thinking about all the stories and poems I had left inside of me. Eventually I turned to the stage and began performing spoken word poetry. I went on to become part of a team that went to the 2018 National Poetry Slam. I spoke in front of thousands at the March to End Rape Culture in Philadelphia. I featured for venues like SoFar Sounds, The Wilma Theatre, and spotlighted at Pecola Breedlove & The Freedom Party. And my career is just starting! Now I want to help others find the peace, power, and solace that I have found in writing. There are not enough spaces where our stories are encouraged and celebrated. I want to create a space where survivors can be their unedited selves. No judgement or shame, just beautiful writing! I hope you will join me in my cause and maybe pick up a new skill or refine an old one. The workshops happen every third Wednesday of the month with the first being on June 19th! Join the Facebook group in the bio to get all the information, prompts, and general community.

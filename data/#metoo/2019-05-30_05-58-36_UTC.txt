May is mental health awareness month, and before it comes to an end I want to say this to anyone else out there who has struggled with their mental health following an assault - if you have ever felt guilt & shame after hearing things like “well why didn’t you scream?” from people you thought would be there for you, if you’ve ever felt like permanently damaged goods, if you are still struggling to trust again because you trusted the person who did this, if you are living with knowing the person who did this has moved on with their nice life while you suffer, if you have quietly cried yourself to sleep or broken down in the shower after having the brave smiling face on all day....please know you are not alone, it was not your fault, and it DOES get better. I hope you remember that it’s okay to not be okay sometimes, and find the strength to open up to the people who truly want to support you (and let go of those who don’t because you deserve better than that). 🖤 I also have to say thank you to my amazing friends for being those people for me (you know who you are 💕). Thank you for reminding me that I don’t always have to be the strong one when I try to get away with telling you “I’m fine”, for proving to me that I can still trust people, and for encouraging me to start stepping back out of my comfort zone (especially looking at you on that one @meowbrina 👀😘) and taking down the big walls I’ve built up, even when it’s scary. During the hardest moments you all reminded me that it will get better & there are still so many beautiful things worth living for, now it’s my turn to pass that message on to whoever needs to hear it. 💕 #mentalhealthawarenessmonth #metoo #mentalhealthawareness #sendinglove

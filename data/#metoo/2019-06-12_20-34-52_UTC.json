However, I did not understand that because I forgave someone did not mean that I had to continue to be in relationship with them.  Looking back on the way I dealt with hurt in relationships, forgiveness translated to: \u201cI will stuff the pain I feel about what you did so we can resume our relationship.  I am afraid of losing you, so I will rush to \u2018put the past behind us\u2019 and hope for the best, meanwhile, putting my heart at risk again.\u201d In reality, many of the people that I was dealing with were not safe people.  They had not earned my trust, in fact, they had broken it.  Now, I understand that forgiveness does not equal reconciliation.  And reconciliation without recovery or genuine efforts to change can be dangerous.\n\n#lovedvaluedpurposed"

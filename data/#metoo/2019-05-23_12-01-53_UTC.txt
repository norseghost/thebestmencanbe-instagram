ðŸ”Ž The exact number of Lai Dai Han is unknown. According to Busan Ilbo, there are at least 5,000 and as many as 30,000. 
South Korean sources claim that the number of Vietnamese-Korean mixed children is inflated because aid organizations supported them before proper accurate research was done.

The Lai Dai Han are demanding an apology. South Korea has never acknowledged claims of sexual violence allegedly perpetrated by its troops against thousands of women and girls, some as young as 12 â€“ or the children born as a result.

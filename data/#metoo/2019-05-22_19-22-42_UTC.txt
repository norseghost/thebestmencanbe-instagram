Here @god_sent_the_light we support Fathom Magazine we are not sponsored by them but we believe this is an important magazine contributing to the Christian community. Reposted from @fathom_mag -  NEW ISSUE What is a body? For some it's a tool—a thing to be refined Chris-Traeger style. For others, it houses a mixture of emotions—from shame to celebration. For still others, the body represents a list of struggles—malfunctioning muscles, breaking bones, or undiagnosed disorders.⠀⠀
⠀⠀
As believers who cling to the notion that God intended our frames of flesh to be more than soul-houses, we want to think well about our bodies. In this issue, we've invited writers from all kinds of backgrounds and life experiences to share their perspectives on one thing all humans have in common: the body.⠀⠀
⠀⠀
Join us as we dive beneath the surface of instagram photos and health magazines to explore the beauty of the body as God created it, as sin breaks it, and as Jesus redeems it. ⠀⠀

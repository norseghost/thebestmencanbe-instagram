It has been a slow crawl to finding the appropriate time and platform to share my story.  There have been several events over the last five years or so that made me want to go public with my struggle. But I was always afraid of what might happen. Of what people might think of me.

HIM? I've been discussed publicly, not always by name, but enough where people I knew would know it was about me. Lies. And embellishments. About what he did to me. About our relationship. About his role as a father (which has always been pretty much non-existent). Well I have found my voice. As time passes, and my story u folds for you, he will also hear what I have to say. Because there will come a day where my family and I will not have to look over our shoulders, wondering if he's going to turn up. 
Always remember, an abuser doesn't abuse everyone they meet. So it may be surprising for people to hear what I have to say. But I have nothing to prove. The truth is, he knows what he has done. And what do we do to cockroaches like him? We shine the light in them and watch them scatter.

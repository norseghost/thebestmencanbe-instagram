Never imagined a place I\u2019d devoted so much to would discriminate against women to the point where someone could admit my truth was in fact, the TRUTH. Where surveillance was proof but I was asked to \u201chave an open heart and if this still bothers you, seek mental help.\u201d I figured, I could fight for what is right or I could be disrespected. Nothing was resolved, just shifted. In public, I was constantly approached by past/present employees who I didn\u2019t know w/, \u201cI heard what you did to him\u201d. The replacement wasn\u2019t much better. Our very first sit down he explained to me that bc my rep was already tainted, I probably shouldn\u2019t be there. He quickly started becoming comfortable becoming intoxicated and spreading false accusations about my sex life involving several other employees. The lies spread about me as a woman completely changed my attitude and people\u2019s attitude towards me. I was done fighting. I started building networking and attending interviews for weeks leading up to my departure w/ the company. I didn\u2019t want to allow sexism, lies and extreme targeting to win. It wasn\u2019t until everything finally snowballed that I realized I\u2019d been blocking my own blessings. I was so determined to stand up for equality that I didn\u2019t realize my full potential was there; bitter, upset, hurt and stagnant. Less than 24hrs after my departure w/ the company, I had a call back for a management offer at a leading competitor. Just like that, the universe reminded me I was trying to make a path that wasn\u2019t for me work. The cold truth is that as women, we learn to stay quiet before we are severely hurt. I don\u2019t and never will regret being a voice for women. Despite the fact that having a voice came w/ a million and one punches along the way, I hope it made a positive difference for someone else. Let\u2019s move past \u201cshe lied\u201d or \u201cit wasn\u2019t THAT bad\u201d or discussing the male\u2019s title or accomplishments when discussing women\u2019s rights. But let us also remember how bad ass we are and how we have a better future paved for us."

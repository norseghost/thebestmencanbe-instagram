✨BODY ACCEPTENCE✨ {picture and writing from 2017}
I've begun to see my body for what it is: a vessel for exploring the world, a place where I can hide or play or scream or feel deeply.  I've always had issues with it, I've often felt so trapped in this body that didn't work. I've had chondromalisia from a young age, panic attacks, low blood sugar, interstitial cystitis, chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, tendinitis. My body has rarely felt like a capable vessel for sport.

But this year my body has been more than a skeleton or a cage, I've loved it, and I've nearly cried of joy in the moments I've felt it dance on the rock. My arms have held every ounce of me on one twist of the fist in a granite crack. My feet have found purchase on rocks the size of a pin and not fallen under my weight. Along side fellow climbers, different bodies with the same goal, I've learned to appreciate my body for what it can do. My arms are long, all the better for reaching holds. My hands large, all the better for jamming, and my fingers skinny, able (rest in comments)

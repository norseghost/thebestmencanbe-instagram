TW - talk of #MeToo , sexism, abuse & harassment in the music industry
⚡️
The band @thetutsband talked onstage on Tuesday about having spoken about abuse by a man, he subsequently has sued them for defamation. They now need to raise £35k for legal fees & are not allowed to mention his name. (Don’t ask me who it is, I don’t know). They set up a collective #SolidarityNotSilence where you can donate money. The Tuts are an independent London band, with no manager & no label.

Sexism is rampant in the music industry & women and non-binary people are abused. We know this is not the only case, last year @jessickaaddams opened up about her rape by a well known musician and this year @askulloffoxes talking about Ninja from Die Antwoord being an abuser & subsequently having her album blocked. Right now with the #meToo movement; women, trans, GNC and non-binary* people are not believed. Opening up and talking about it is dangerous, even if there are multiple people who have been abused & willing to testify & there being physical evidence. We fear more abuse & with The Tuts, being financially ruined, it’s not ok. The music industry, musicians and fans should all be safe and safe to disclose what happened to them.

*I include trans women in women. By talking about sexism in the music industry it doesn’t mean that I think men don’t get abused/raped, they do. This post is about sexism.
Also acknowledge sexism in the music industry is also worse for black people, people of colour, trans people, disabled (hey how many venues are accessible/have a stage wheelchair users can access), Muslims, LGBTQAI, Deaf, poor/working class, fat, autistic people etc.

The Tuts are a band of three women, 2/3 of which are POC and working class. Access for them to “make it” already has more challenges. They need your support.
⠀
But also support female, trans & non binary bands, give them money, go to their shows, share their music.

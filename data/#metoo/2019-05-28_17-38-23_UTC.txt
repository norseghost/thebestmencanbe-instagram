SUPERIOR 
Video 2 of 4 used in my 2020 trend report for high fashion label, Helmut Lang. This visual mood board represents the trailblazing in gender fluid clothing that Helmut Lang is known for. 
The brand has always aimed to re-imagine the everyday uniform. This trend, however, focuses on women’s wear and how today’s career woman seeking or holding superior positions needs to look and feel. This idea of survival of the fittest contrasted with corporate burn out are all ideas modern women face all while battling microaggressions among their male colleagues.

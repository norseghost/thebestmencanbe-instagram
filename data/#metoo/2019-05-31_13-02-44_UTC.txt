The idea that speaks with fire is the one that shines the most. 
I had a dream last night that women could not walk the halls by themselves, men had to escort them or they would be held prisoner. 
I was running through the halls shouting "Catch me if you can."
Something about that seemed liberating. 
But later through this dream, the other women and I realized this idea was not working, for we just looked like fools and we would not be made a fool. 
We never came up with a better idea before I awoke. And Yet,  something about that feels very liberating too. 
They keep telling us to shine but then blowing out our fire. 
But the sun still casts shadows

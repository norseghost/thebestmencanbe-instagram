"I didn’t grow up with a “good” female role model. My mom was not emotionally present and for a long time I struggled to create true deep connection with other women. I would have girlfriends, but I only showed a facade, never my true self (expect with my one BFF). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I filled a lot of my emotional needs by always having a boyfriend (sometimes I didn’t even like them, but I preferred that than being alone). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Over the past years I’ve done a lot of personal work. I’ve learned about the importance of being humble—saying I’m sorry and stop pretending that my problems are bigger than everyone else’s. I’ve also learned to be more compassionate towards myself and appreciate all the good things in my life. I've stopped constantly comparing myself to others. Thanks to that, I now have a beautiful community of women. And while I still choose to only fully open up with my long time BFF, I can connect, love and feel loved by other women (including my mom) as well. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

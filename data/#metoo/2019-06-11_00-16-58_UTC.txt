Have you been in a playroom before? Was it as a sex club? A hotel takeover? A resort?
•
As more people become interested in alternative relationships, more people engage in sexual activity in spaces like playrooms. And one thing to remember is that the Golden Rules stay the same no matter what!
•
⭐️ASK FIRST. Always ask first before doing something or trying something new in a playroom! If you’re switching from kissing to sex, swapping play partners or introducing a new toy - ASK!
⭐️NO MEAN NO. If someone says no - you better stop whatever it is you’re doing!
⭐️DO NOT ENTER A SCENE IN PROGRESS. If there is an orgy or steamy session going on - don’t just join in or touch those involved! A scene is in progress and proper consent is hard to obtain in the middle of a scene. Wait until after they are finished or organize a scene of your own!
⭐️RESPECT. Talking, making comments, laughing, pointing can be distracting. You can watch if you maintain a healthy perimeter but be respectful!
⭐️CONSENT IS EVERYTHING. A safe space is a sexy space!

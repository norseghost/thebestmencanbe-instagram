DON'T!
Don't Starve yourself each day trying to fit into an unrealistic mould of beauty and perfection. 
Diet culture will try to tell you that losing weight is a badge of honour, that it's your job as a woman and that it makes you valuable.
It'll try to convince you that weight is equated to worth, with low weight being a sign of high value.
But the truth is, the diet culture was built on a throne of lies.
Sometimes the weight you need to lose isn't on your body.
You'll never have it all completely figured out  when it comes to your body because it's fluid, dynamic and naturally changing.
Being with your body involves being in attuned relationship with it, knowing that it'll change, grow, evolve, decay and that's exactly what bodies do.
So, Break the body myths and love your body fiercely and bravely.
Our bodies and looks can never be our currency.

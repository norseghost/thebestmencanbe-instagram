According to the National Organization for Women the wage gap in pay for Black, Latino and Native American moms is very wide. For every dollar made by a white, non hispanic men these moms make around $0.50 cents, that’s 50% less. In the other hand white moms get paid $0.70 cents for every dollar the father makes. On this mom’s equal pay day today let’s support every mom out there that is trying to provide for their children while fighting the prejudice. Especially the ones in marginalized communities that suffer racism based on their skin color and country of origin. 
We love and support all of you moms. ❤️

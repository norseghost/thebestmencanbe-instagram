Day 2 of the @accaliaartsfestival : We are pleased to welcome @thesasssisters the sassiest vocal trio around as they perform an eclectic mix of musical styles.  Not only do The Sass Sisters sing Jazz, Pop, Country, Soul, Musical Theatre and Opera, they also play their own accompaniment. It promises to be a truly sassy summer evening.

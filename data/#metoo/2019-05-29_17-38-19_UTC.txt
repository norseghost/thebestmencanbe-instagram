This is a post by ‘notsofine’, saying: “Sometimes You just need to take a step back and realise how far You’ve come instead of how far left You have to go. You’re going to mess up and You’re goig to make mistakes and You aren’t always going to get it right. You’re human. It happens. It’s okay. What matters is You pick yourself up again and keep going. You’re doing the best You can. And You can do better. I believe in You and I am so proud of how far You’ve come.”

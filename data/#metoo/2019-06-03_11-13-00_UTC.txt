On Friday I headed over to City Hall to meet with our lovely mayor @sadiq , because he had a pretty important statement to make. 
A statement about how we ought to treat women globally, and a call to arms against the damaging and anachronistic approach President Trump seems to be taking towards our gender. 
Proud of this!

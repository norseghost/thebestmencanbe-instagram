Many members of the “pro-life” movement are the same people who support cutting funding to programs like WIC, food stamps, and other programs which help mothers and children. If they were really concerned with “life,” and not just controlling women, they would commit themselves to make sure children have enough food to eat, a proper education, and a place to live.
Not to mention that most “pro life” people are for the death penalty, support separating immigrant families, are pro-war, and are against gun control, when guns have killed or injured 248 children just in 2019 so far. (gunviolencearchive.org). As someone who is pro-choice, I believe that we need to improve the quality of life for the children already living in our planet, not force women to carry their fetuses to term and then not caring about the baby’s living conditions or lives from the moment they leave the uterus.

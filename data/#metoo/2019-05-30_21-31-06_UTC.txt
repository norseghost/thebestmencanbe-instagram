Ok kids let's talk about trauma. Trauma likes to rear it's ugly head when you least expect it. For me a a scent of Jasmine and pool volume ended up smelling like naphthalene and brought back a horrible experience I actually had worked through. As my hair dried I thought it could only get better. This morning I thought into wash the scent out... And it only got worse. After spending the night reprocessing all that bad it was a stronger feeling than ever. So. I took matters into a professional. I had my hair washed and got it out. The trauma is still back to being fresh. I've talked it out, I've processed, I've even finally remembered his first name... So here's your reminder, be kind to yourself, allow yourself to feel how you feel, and if you need to take drastic measures... Take them. I already had a plan in place for bleaching my hair and even cutting it if I couldn't function.

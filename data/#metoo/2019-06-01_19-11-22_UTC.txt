The last year has been kinda weird, no? Sometimes it feels like the emotional backlash of the #metoo movement was the rallying rebel cry of “Free Speech! I can say what ever I want!” Listen, you’d be hard pressed to find anyone in this country who *doesnt* believe in free speech. 
But...I just can’t shake this crazy notion I have that the founding fathers had something different in mind. I just can’t shake the idea that the intent of the first amendment WAS NOT to give people the right to act like assholes, any more than the intent of the Second Amendment was to condone murder. 
The free speech primal scream in the 21st century democratic-but-currently-heavily-divided United States sounds like an excuse for bad behavior. Yup. Like the college freshman that makes an asshole of herself at the frat party and writes it off as intoxication. (And yeah, yeah, I’ve been that girl once or twice before.) But it’s not something I strive for. And neither should you. 
And as a mom...I’m totally blown away by the fear and confusion of this message we are passing down to our children, consciously and subconsciously. 
Share your toys. Be nice. Love thy neighbor. And if someone disagrees with you, remind that idiot that in this country we can say whatever harmful, hurtful thing we want. 
And wanna know the kicker? These are THE SAME parents who organize school events to remind kids to “Embrace kindness” and “Build Bridges” and “Support Your Favorite Charity.” These are THE SAME people who will block anyone on social media who says something they don’t like. THE SAME people who whisper and nudge in secret, conspiratorial-esque groups and accuse *everyone*👏 *else*👏 of prejudice and racism and bigotry. 
So how about we try something different: How about we use that rallying “Free Speech!” cry ONLY when someone else needs help having their voice be heard?  What if we were to remind ourselves — with our inside voice — that my right to free speech is equal to yours. Could we try to remember that different or conflicting opinions falls within the boundaries of free speech — 
Even. If. You. Don’t. Like. What. They. Say. 
P.S. Happy Pride Day! ❤️🧡💛💚💙

This.
I've been reading this and I'm blown away by @amberrosetamblyn 's honesty, vulnerability, and perspective and what's been happening in our world and how it influences us as women. The societal norms of misogyny and sexism that are created in all forms of business and personal interactions and how she addresses them is quite insightful. I highly recommend it.

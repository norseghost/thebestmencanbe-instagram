                        "text": "\u201cConsider this: women in pain are much more likely than men to receive prescriptions for sedatives, rather than pain medication, for their ailments. One study even showed women who received coronary bypass surgery were only half as likely to be prescribed painkillers, as compared to men who had undergone the same procedure. We wait an average of 65 minutes before receiving an analgesic for acute abdominal pain in the ER in the United States, while men wait only 49 minutes.\n\nThese gender biases in our medical system can have serious and sometimes fatal repercussions. For instance, a 2000 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that women are seven times more likely than men to be misdiagnosed and discharged in the middle of having a heart attack. Why? Because the medical concepts of most diseases are based on understandings of male physiology, and women have altogether different symptoms than men when having a heart attack.\n\nTo return to the issue of chronic pain, 70% of the people it impacts are women. And yet, 80% of pain studies are conducted on male mice or human men. One of the few studies to research gender differences in the experience of pain found that women tend to feel it more of the time and more intensely than men. While the exact reasons for this discrepancy haven\u2019t been pinpointed yet, biology and hormones are suspected to play a role.\u201d -Harvard Medical School\n\n#endometriosis #invisibleillness #chronicfatigue #spoonielife #butyoudontlooksick #fibro #arthritis #lupus #fibromyalgia #autoimmunedisease #autoimmune #womenshealth #cysticfibrosis #multiplesclerosis #pcos #womensfitness #feminism #lymedisease #pcosawareness #infertility #womensrights #metoo #womeninmedicine #ttccommunity #ivfsisters #lupuswarrior #hashimotos #equalrights #chronicpain #ehlersdanlossyndrome"

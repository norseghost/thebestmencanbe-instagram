SAY IT WITH ME: 📢 IN-TER-SEC-TION-AL 👏  FEM-IN-IS-M⠀
STORY TIME: 📖⠀
I got a DM the other day asking if this is a black-owned business. ⠀
⠀
It's not.⠀
⠀
They thought it was because I post alot about minorities, including the black community. I understand the confusion. And it's actually sad. Because we often don't see races supporting other races as passionate as we do for our own.  SO why do I do it? Because I genuinely care about the hardships every race endures. Even if its not my own. 💕 That is true justice.⠀

If you can, tune into a special Newsbeat this lunchtime all about sex abuse in music. 
For the last 12 months I’ve been gathering stories from women who say they’ve been abused by bands and the people who work with them. Now we’ve taken some of those stories to the group that represents Britain’s music industry - UK Music. It says it’s taking the problem “extremely seriously”. There’s loads more to say - but it would be great if you could listen... link in comments! 
We’ve also had coverage on @bbcwomanshour, @bbc5live and @bbcradio2.

What ever “type” of rape you are a victim of, it is undeniably non consensual. The whole reason it’s called rape is because it’s the process of someone forcing another party to have sex WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. It’s really quite a simple concept, if anyone involved says ‘no’ or shows signs they’re uncomfortable etc. then it should stop. Also rape is rape and if it leads to a pregnancy it should certainly be acceptable for the person to receive an abortion. You are disgusting if you think it’s okay to force someone to carry a foetus and raise a child that they don’t want (even when they’re just a child themselves) ~ 🧀 #rape #consensualrape #sexualabuse #sex #consent #nomeansno #metoo

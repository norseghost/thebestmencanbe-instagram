Excited to perform Shattered at @lyrichyperion Sunday 6/16 at 8pm! 💕🎭⭐️
Shattered is a dark comedy solo show that uses humor to heal, while raising awareness about the psychological impact of sexual assault. It’s a fast-paced journey through dating, dysfunction and sexual devastation- told through the voices of 35 characters! 
Shattered is directed by @soaringsoloartist .

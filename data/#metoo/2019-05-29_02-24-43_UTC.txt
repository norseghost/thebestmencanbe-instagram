Complex-PTSD, or post-traumatic stress from chronic violence, has lots of symptoms. I have often heard of visual flashbacks, but just today learned about emotional and physical flashbacks. Often when the trauma occurs during the early years of life and pre-verbal stage, our brains wonâ€™t retrieve visual memories. Instead the memories will be released through strong emotional responses to present neutral stimuli or through physical pain that mirrored the pain our bodies held in the past. Watch your visions, feel your emotions, allow your body to release the pain. You can heal and deserve it. Thank you @bpdrecoverycoaching for the information! .

This is only the second time I’ve performed “Monster,” the first being at a benefit concert for survivors years before the song was even produced. I didn’t write this song to perform it; in fact, I still can only perform it if I keep my eyes closed. This is the most personal, most painful, most powerful song I’ve ever written and released, and the most private as well. Thank you @femalesunfiltered for giving me a safe space to share this song, and to @kayjaofficial for always being by my side, guitar (or drum kit) in hand. The full performance/interview is in @femalesunfiltered bio. Link to the “Monster” music video is in my bio. #MeToo .

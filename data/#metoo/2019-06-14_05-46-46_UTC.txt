For years, Americans have shrugged their shoulders over NSA surveillance and government access to digital data and said, “I don’t care; I have nothing to hide.” Now they are starting to see that maybe they do have something to hide. They are starting to understand that their own preferences and those of their friends and family can be hoovered up and stored in perpetuity and fed through algorithms to produce manipulative messaging intended to move beliefs and influence actions.

Although regulators and state attorneys general are launching investigations, the real hammer will be the market. Whether it is Facebook, Twitter, or some other social media platform, when users start to realize that the data they are sharing may be used against them or cause them to lose control over their beliefs or be manipulated, they will begin to shut off. If the company can’t be trusted with personal data, users simply will not use that platform and advertisers will go elsewhere.

Roger McNamee, Mark Zuckerberg’s long-time mentor, saw the risk early on and tried to get Facebook executives to manage it, but his warnings fell on deaf ears.  In an interview with Christiane Amanpour, McNamee said that in October 2016, he personally warned Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg of the magnitude of the risk, but failed to get their attention. According to McNamee, Facebook’s leaders kept arguing that Facebook is a platform company, not a media company and “we’re not responsible for what third parties do.” McNamee warned them then, - You have 1.7 billion members and if they decide you are responsible, it won’t matter what the law says.

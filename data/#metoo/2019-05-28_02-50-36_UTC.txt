Respect - Even today women continue to fight for their rights. Rights to their own bodies, rights to not be taken advantage of when taxing female products when so many men’s products have none. The fact we have to fight for insurance companies to pay for birth control yet they continue to hand out little blue pills like tick-tacks so men can get a hard-on any time they want. It’s pure insanity. How do they think women get pregnant in the first place. Hello! Are men not responsible for what seeds they plant? It’s an insult beyond insults. The list goes and on and just recently a man told me he believes no women (not a man but women) should  only be “allowed” to vote if she owns land. 😂 🤣 😆 He repeated it several times after I asked him to of course, because I couldn’t believe he was saying this with a straight face. This is also the CEO of a very large company. My point being, we need to look at all humans with respect when creating new laws for them, especially the ones who create life. Oh wait,  that’s all of us. We create it together so the laws should have equal value. These laws should have compromise and be clear. .

Rough sex seems to be a trend in women’s work. Our discomfort with the work is not purely about individual tastes, as we see in this Guardian piece by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett. It’s not just the mixture of love and torture that we struggle with.
-
And it makes sense for women to explore the depth of abuse, given where we are today. The #metoo movement brought sexual abuse to the surface, allowing women to voice their experiences.
-
These stories could echo some of that. They are valid outlets. And as Cosslett says, some are “brilliantly written”.
-
And rough sex in women’s work is not a new thing.
The crux of our discomfort, the reason I avoid many, is that these new female characters are often written as vacant as male dominance has always imagined women to be. Voids to be filled by male essence.
-
Depicting women who not only experience sexual violence, but now want it. Soliciting the violence. Women not fighting to have control.
-
Our discomfort therefore is fear. Fear that perhaps for some, male dominance has won. That women have internalised its demand of them. Our resistance depleted.
-
This is not where we want to be!

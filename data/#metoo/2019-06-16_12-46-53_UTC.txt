We used the ashes of patriarchal injustices to fertilize a Shumard Oak sapling in the music video for Patriarchy Song. That tree will nurture dozens of moth species, including Luna Moth, and its leaves will be blood red in fall. The blood of my sisters has been shed by my brothers for too long. They cut our bodies, our vaginas and our souls. We have had enough. ðŸŒŸ
(Images show RAINBOW in black dress, standing in a windy field, holding a shovel. Subsequent images show her boots on the shovel as it penetrates the earth, then her pink wispy hair from above as she nestles the oak in its new home, then a view of the beautiful new green leaves from above. Images are all rather dark and moody) â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

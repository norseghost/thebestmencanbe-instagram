The fundraiser for @beautyforfreedom couldn't have been more perfect! The space was literally boiling over with love and support, I'm extremely grateful and humbled to have been part of it. 
If you didn't get a chance to join us, don't worry! There's still time to donate to @beautyforfreedom @challengingheights and @denimdaynyc. Visit their pages for more information about who they are and how they're supporting victims/ survivors of human trafficking, sexual violence and forced labor. 
And, yes. I noticed my mouth is wide open during my speech for absolutely no reason ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I promise I wasn't yelling!

Going to college and getting (mostly) good grades\n2. Working at my University's bookstore twice \ud83d\udcd6\n3. Going to Canada twice \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\n4. Living in and taking care of my own apartment\n5. Switching from a Fashion Merchandising to a History major on my own accord\n6. Being an active member at my school's Fitness Center, the Well. Back in high school I was mocked in P.E. for not being \"athletic\" enough because I was too short to play volleyball. Now I probably work out more than those people from my P.E. class do \ud83d\ude1d \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n7. Signing petitions through change.org that are changing the world\n8. Going on awesome, breathtaking Peak Adventures trips \ud83c\udf32 \ud83d\udcf7\n9. Going to #metoo on-campus conferences and events \n10. And last but not least having a highly entertaining Instagram account and being able to reach out to so many people around the world \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udcf1 And also to make fun of the diet industry and dumb, old men in power \ud83d\ude1d \ud83d\ude05 \nNow my next step is to find an actual job/career. I have no clue on exactly what I want to do and I'm totally tripping. I only have a year left of college and there is SO much pressure to find a job and/or an internship. I need to find motivation to go out and look for a job but it just gets SO overwhelming and I end up crawling back in my Crab shell. What's a girl to do? (p.s., sorry if my eyes look red in this photo: just bad camera quality)\n#historymajor #historystudent #feminist\n#feminism #highschooldrama #livingmybestlife #lifeaftercollege #graduationanniversary #comesofar #lookatmenow #happytuesday #whatsagirltodo"

I am hosting a monthly writing workshop for survivors of domestic abuse, sexual abuse, and rape. Writing is a powerful tool and outlet. I want to help others find the solace and purpose I have found in it. 
The workshop will have prompts and exercises to help create something beautiful out of the ugly in this world. I want this to be a safe space where you don’t have to explain yourself. I want this to be a place where your story is never a burden. I want to create a community of survivors who uplift and accept each other fully. 
For now, I will be hosting it in person at my home in Media PA (dm for address). If it grows larger, I will move to a bigger venue. I am also opening it up to those that can't physically be there. I will be posting prompts, healing exercises, and anything I can to foster a community of survivors. I can also skype you in or facetime you in. I created this group so there can be an online community outside of the physical workshop. Please feel free to tag your own work, struggles, and accomplishments to be featured.

The first workshop is on June 19th at 6:30pm. It will be a suggested donation of $5 so there can be light refreshments. Anything I don’t spend on the food will be donated to a different organization each month that helps end rape culture and domestic abuse.

All ages and genders are welcome!

Hope to see you lovelies soon!

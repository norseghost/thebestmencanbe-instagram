I see when people pretend to have zero emotional intelligence. My ex is like this. Lots of crying and confusion about how they feel, but once you confront them about their behavior it’s all emotional manipulation. It’s not that men don’t have #emotionalintelligence it’s how we let them sell it to us so we do ALL THE HEAVY LIFTING. Regram from @latinarebels

Reflecting On Humanity: The Importance of the SWANS TRILOGY⁣⁣
⁣

Humanity can be described in many ways. I could come up with about 10 adjectives right now off the top of my head to describe both the current and past states of the human race. Embodying those adjectives artistically, however, is something I cannot ever imagine doing. Noise-rock behemoths Swans have done so in an incredible 3-album run. While none of these records are exactly “concept albums,” they definitely all have underlying themes and political notions throughout. ⁣⁣

For example, the 2014 album To Be Kind features a 32-minute track split into two parts. Titled “Bring the Sun / Toussaint L'Ouverture,” I interpret this hulking composition as a reflection on modern segregation and how it affects us. Singer and bandleader Michael Gira does this not primarily through lyrics, though. The building suspense and eventually triumphant climax of the instrumentation, paired with dynamic lyricism of “Freedom! followed by “Toussaint L'Ouverture” and Liberté! Egalitié! Fraternité!” is one of many elements that makes the song truly perfect for me. This triumphant declaration of freedom is a fantastic conclusion to a wonderful composition. 
Toussaint’s struggle in the French Revolution in the past parallels with the same hatred African-Americans face in 2019 from the same white privileged people that Africans did in the late 1700s. Displaying this parallel through art is truly amazing and simply brilliant to me. While this interpretation may be a bit of a stretch, there’s just something that makes me think that the imagery of the “Sun” in the first half of the track matched with the “Freedom” of the second half has a meaning past what is seen on the surface. This is what I love about Swans. Their ability to transcend the music itself and cause the listener to think about if the song they are hearing could have a deeper meaning is something that I look for in every artist, and how I tell the difference between ‘good’ and ‘great’. ⁣⁣

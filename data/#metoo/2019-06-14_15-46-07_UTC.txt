In April, as a part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, we organized two screenings of Roll Red Roll. If you didn't have a chance to attend, it will be broadcasted nationally on your local PBS station on June 17th, 10/9c. Please consider tuning in and spreading the word with your family, friends, and peers!

As important as child sexual abuse prevention is, being able to recognize signs of abuse in a child is just as important. The signs can vary child to child and aren't always easy to see, but if you educate yourself on the warning signs you might be able to spot them more easily. .

I personally experienced a lot of these signs. By educating ourselves as adults we could possibly recognize a child who needs help, stop the abuse, and get that child the help they need! ðŸ’›

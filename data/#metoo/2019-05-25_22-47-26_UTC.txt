My melancholy was gold dust in your hands; 
On your long hands I scattered my life; 
My sweetnesses remained clutched in your hands; 
Now I am a vial of perfume, emptied 
How much sweet torture quietly suffered, 
When, my soul wrested with shadowy sadness, 
She who knows the tricks, I passed the days 
kissing the two hands that stifled my life  Alfonsina Storni

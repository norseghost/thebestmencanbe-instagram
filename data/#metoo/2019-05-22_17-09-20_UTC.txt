Please watch and share this video (link in my bio) that I made for my friend, Narelle. She is a survivor of sexual assault and bullying on the job for over a year and had no support from her boss. This treatment in the workplace needs to END and it starts with sharing our stories. #sexualassault #workplacebullying #womensrights #brave #survivornotvictim #metoo #womenintrades #vancouverpoli #cndpoli #bcpoli #vancouvernews #feminism #speakup #timesup #bctrades

“He targeted single Native moms for whom the loss of employment would be devastating,” she said.

She struggled over whether she should say something to school administrators about Bordeaux’s behavior. “He’s such an important man; he’s done so much for Indian education. I thought, maybe I should just take one for the team,” Manning said.

The process for reporting sexual harassment at the Bureau of Indian Education and the Bureau of Indian Affairs is unclear and difficult to navigate.

Unlike most of the nation’s public schools, however, directly funded BIE schools are not subject to Title IX.

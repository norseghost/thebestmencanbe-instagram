Checking between the sheets for scorpions with a flashlight tonight after courageously crying during prayer with my spiritual business coach @sisters.of.the.mermaid.moon , I realized we all probably have many little brave moments like this every day that want celebrating. 
It doesn’t have to be sobbing on camera, or sharing a #metoo moment, or running down the street topless, in order to be brave and in need of recognition. 
Let us celebrate each other’s brave moments, be it speaking up in a relationship, or diving in a cold lake 💦 , or trying something new. —————
You’re invited  to share your brave moments below.  Let me celebrate you. 💖💪🏼💖

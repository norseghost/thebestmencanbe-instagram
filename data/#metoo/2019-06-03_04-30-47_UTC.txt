As Christians we have a responsibility to stand up for those who are being abused, neglected, or used. 
To stand by and watch Christian leaders abuse the power of God is unacceptable. 
If you see something, speak up. 
You were given a voice for a reason. 
Use it to preserve justice and righteousness. 
Do not hold your peace. 
Corrupt leaders count on the fact that they can intimidate you into silence. 
What’s happening at Miracle Arena is not ok. Pastors and prophets sleeping with the young women in the church is not normal or acceptable. 
Asking people to routinely sacrifice their rent to get a Miracle is not ok. 
Cursing members who leave the church is not ok. 
It’s fraud, abuse, and corruption. 
I WILL NOT HOLD MY PEACE AND WATCH MORE PEOPLE GET HURT.

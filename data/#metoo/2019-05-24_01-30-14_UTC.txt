I’ve never been more terrified in my life. .
.
We look for the light as women. And, I ain’t talking this hippie dippy shit - although I am a yoga instructor. Namaste. .
.
We look for a place where someone can see us. In case we are assaulted. .
.
The predator may get a jail sentence for a couple of months, maybe years if the Judge is self aware and NOT socially aware - but the person that had to witness and absorb the assault (I will NOT say victim) - you are the S(h)ero - this is the human that has to live with the consequences. (woman or man) .
.
Flight or mutha fu*kin’ fight. That’s what happens to your brain. Nothing and no one seems safe after that. .
.
You rob yourself. You rob others. Of LOVE. After that happens. Because you are protecting yourself from there on out. .
.
I was assaulted more recently than I would like to admit and I’ve been a hermit. My house. Mom’s house. Client meeting.  Nada más. No more. But, damn pain + anguish make your work so damn impactful. .
.
The true challenge is not just over coming my fear. The true challenge is to not see others as the enemy. .
.
I walked after sunset for the first time in a LONG time in #dumbo to see the Brooklyn Bridge from a new perspective. By myself. I looked for the light. My stomach dropped when a man walked beside me. I refused to adopt hate or fear.  Because I refuse to add hate to the conversation. .
.
My respite is this post to you. As #TeacherKing taught me on this trip - social media is a tool. To connect. To be heard. To help others overcome. .

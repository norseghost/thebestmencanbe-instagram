                        "text": "Family members often choose to side with sexual abuse perpetrators and against their victims, especially if the abuse was committed within the family.\u00a0They are pressured to \u201cforgive\u201d the perpetrator and consider his or her feelings, while their own pain, responses to trauma, and anger toward the perpetrator are overlooked at best and condemned at worst.\u00a0Perpetrators are embraced and favored by family members as they join together in shutting down acknowledgment of, or attention to, sexual abuse. Survivors, on the other hand, are blamed and viewed as the troublemakers in the family. This has a devastating effect on survivors. They are left feeling alone, unprotected and abused all over again. Denial, minimization, victim-blaming, scapegoating and ostracism are common. All of this creates a secondary trauma and crushes survivors\u2019 hopes of getting support from the very people who they assume will love and support them the most. It is common for survivors to be told they need to \u201cmove on\u201d, forgive their abusers, or \u201cstop focusing on the past\u201d. Many are told they are going against the will of God by standing up for themselves. Family members often accuse survivors of choosing to be negative and unhappy, a hurtful misunderstanding of their bravery in facing the truth and advocating for themselves in ways they never could as minors.\nThis is the cold hard truth. The fear behind \"coming out\" about any sexual abuse. When we accept and embrace the truth, it frees us up to begin the journey toward a healthier, better life.\u00a0Survivors who come forward to reveal abuse in the family have already been through a deep and lasting ordeal. They are showing courage, not causing problems. Instead of blame and rejection, they deserve respect, support and a strong dose of their family members\u2019 compassion.\n#sexualabuse #supportsurvivors #metoo #believesurvivors #breakthesilence #notalone #itsnotyourfault #childsexualabuse #sexualassaultsurvivor #gethelp #raiseawareness #rapevictims"

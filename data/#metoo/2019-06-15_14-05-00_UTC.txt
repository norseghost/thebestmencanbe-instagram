The last day I ever drank alcohol was my wedding day... | Part IV
.
The 11 months between my second assault and my wedding were some of the hardest months of my life. From the outside everything seemed picture perfect—I would soon be marrying the love of my life, had just gotten back from a 5 month trip overseas, and I was offered my dream job with a speakers agency soon after returning home.
.
But under the polished surface, there was a sense of shame I again carried...one that made me retreat into myself as I confided only in my fiancé and therapist about my experience in India. The shame said to me “you’re a survivor that other survivors look to for guidance, for strength. How could you let them down, how could you LET this happen again.”
.
I felt like a fraud. How could I get up on a stage and inspire audiences to take a stand against sexual assault, when I had just been assaulted…again? How could I pretend to have it all together? I again brainwashed myself into believing I needed to be strong, that I couldn’t show my “weakness.” And slowly, one mini wine bottle and secret swig from David’s liquor cabinet later—I started to fall back into the patterns of numbing, suppressing and hiding the painful truth.

August 27, 2016. My wedding day.
.
At the time of my wedding I was the unhealthiest I had ever been. I wasn’t eating, wasn’t sleeping, and was drinking in secret whenever I could get the chance. It was too much to bare—portraying a life that wasn’t real, the stress of planning and building my dream wedding, hiding the fact that I had been drinking again, and the anxiety of coming face to face with so many people I had desperately avoided for those 11 months. I felt exposed, naked—like everyone was going to see straight through my armor. They were going to see the real me, pain and flaws and all. I was terrified.
.
I sat crouched down in the closet of the cabin where myself and my bridesmaids were getting ready. I was having a panic attack. My Maid of Honor walked into the closet, handed me my kryptonite and said “drink this quick, it will make you feel better…”

Just attempting a #momentofzen after spending the morning trying to stomach dodgy-codger Donald Trump siding with nerd-alert dictator Kim Jong Un and North Korea’s testing of short-range ballistic missiles. God these two really are a delusional, narcissistic match made in autocrat-Tinder-heaven.
.
Extremely sensitive to criticism or rejection from others; preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, or true love; a need to win at all costs; constant need for praise and admiration; a lack of empathy; frequently demeans, intimidates, bullies, or belittles others - these are just a few of the tell-tale symptoms of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. And these two “world leaders” (jeez, what, our world!?) are text book cases.
.
If you’ve ever had the utter displeasure of meeting someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, you’ll know that these losers are master manipulators, torturers, twisted and warped in their views. They thrive on causing chaos and driving wedges between people/communities - problems that only they, in their infinite self-proclaimed wisdom, can possibly remedy.
.
So I dare you - no I double dare you - to spend five minutes on Trump’s incendiary Twitter today and tell me you can’t tick off each and every one of the above at least three times over. You’ll be doing this face: 😳 And then this one: 😬 And then back to this one: 😳
.
We all have to stop dismissing this man’s extreme mental health issues and start getting very bloody concerned (I am looking at YOU Republicans!) at what we have watched unfold. How much terrifying behaviour has to be laid out in front of us on the world stage, before we all agree that ol’ Uncle Donny is a little cuckoo **points index finger at side of head and draws a circle** .
And now, back to my sunlit desk, @mariekeeyskoot’s wonderful guide, and humming Bob Marley . . . (the humming is a little jaded, let me assure you)
.
LOVE YOU ALL!! **eye-twitches** Xx

@kihmberlie shared this on twitter and we couldn't help but share the lesson we got from this. Queen, you'd never be 100% ready and if you keep waiting to be ready, you'd be waiting for the rest of your life.

Use what is readily available regardless of your current circumstances and make it work. Everything will fall in place eventually. Perhaps what you're waiting on, is waiting on you to take action. Use what you have.ðŸ™‚ | Thank you @kihmberlie for the inspiration. ðŸ’–

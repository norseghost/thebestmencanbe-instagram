Please let us be guided. The fact that you go to a church or the alleged molester is your pastor, doesn't compel you to defend these terrible allegations. Jesus did not die for you to be foolish!!

But wait fess, before we crucify only the pastor. How do you small small gehs even open your leg for your pastor, ride him like a donkey, make him look like he's got epilepsy when he nuts, and still call his wife mummy on Sunday? Na wa o!! You girls too are mostly evil. In fact, your own evil dey fear Devil ðŸ˜ˆ

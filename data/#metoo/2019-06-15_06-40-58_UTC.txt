Where’s the big movement to STOP this from happening? Where are the #metoo or #notinmycoastguard hashtags? When will military healthcare providers & military leadership stop penalizing members for mental health illnesses? When will the manuals be revised?  When will the rehabilitation and healing begin & the rejection & isolation end? The way the military treats their own mentally ill (who often times are made ill by the military service itself) is with degradation and utter disregard. It’s disgusting. #ptsd #addiction #alcoholism #depression #anxiety #mentalillness #suicide #militaryfitness #mentalhealthawareness #ivegotyoursix #military #mentalhealth

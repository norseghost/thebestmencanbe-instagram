I talked about my fight against female genital mutilation, racism and the boards I sit on.\n\nIs this heaven?\nIf Sierra Leone was hell, Australia was going to be heaven. I\u2019ll never forget when we landed on the 9th of June, 2001, at Adelaide Airport I wanted to kiss the ground. Australia was an opportunity to live a full life. But then it happened. Here, I was called a black monkey. I went to school and was told to go back to where I came from. People wouldn\u2019t sit next to me on the bus. Even last year, when I went to the supermarket to buy milk, I was called a black c... by some white dude. We came to Australia for safety. There is no war here, but with racism there\u2019s a new form of insecurity\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about oppression, let\u2019s talk about racism, let\u2019s talk about the patriarchy shall we? Let\u2019s get into it. I want to start talking about how to make this place inclusive and genuinely safe for everyone. That conversation has its own backlash because people don\u2019t like strong, ethnic, black women. Very quickly we\u2019re labelled loud and aggressive. But you know what? I\u2019m reclaiming the angry black woman \u2013 because we should be angry. When one woman a week is killed due to domestic violence in Australia we should be angry. When there are 11 girls at risk each day of FGM (female genital mutilation) in Australia we should be angry. When we can\u2019t walk down the street without being sexually harassed we should be angry.\n\nFor more see link in bio."

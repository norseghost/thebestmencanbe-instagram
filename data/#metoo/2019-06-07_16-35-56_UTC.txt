[Podcast] Apologies: What's Possible When a Good One Is Made⠀
⠀
To err is human, and as such, it seems like a smart idea to get better at apologies. But is it even possible to apologize in certain circumstances, such as the sexual misconduct being revealed in the #metoo movement? Is an apology always the answer? Above all, what makes for a good apology? What becomes possible when one occurs, for giver and receiver?⠀
⠀
We discuss all this, plus the story of a very healing apology, shared by our special guest Nina Hasen, who was one of the commenters on a facebook post that sparked this dialog. (post here: https://buff.ly/2zFIXuO)⠀
⠀
Whether you wish you could say you're sorry for something you did, or you wish someone would apologize to you, this episode is designed to help us deepen our relationship to wrongdoing, and creating a path to making things right. ⠀

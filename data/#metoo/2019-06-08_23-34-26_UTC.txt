.It's better to die before coming to this cruel world.I think due to the cruelty and some devil that's the only option to save yourself.Nobody is more helpless than a father of a daughter now days. After seeing the incident of around the country many are thinking why do they have a girl?
The politicians and some people can't stop themselves from dividing the country in the name of religion and they use rape as a medium as well.
You morons just think what's happening in the society.Devils don't have religion they don't have caste.They only see girls as prey. They only see them to fill their appetite. I don't think this is the way we are going to develop.
It's a request from the government of India that people voted you as they thought you to be the proper man to handle the country.Please have a look on this issue as well. 
As punishment should be as same brutal as the crime.

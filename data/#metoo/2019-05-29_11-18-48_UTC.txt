Today I want to talk about something that’s very important to me. Sexual Assault is a serious problem and affects 1 in every 3 women. It also affects men, though women are the majority. Either way, THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO END. We can’t just keep sweeping it under the rug or blaming the victims and moving on. We need to treat this like a big issue because it is one! Sexual assault is any form form sexual pressure or action that is not consensual. Silence is not consent. “I don’t know” is not consent. “Maybe” is not consent. Even if a person SEEMS completely fine with the idea, it is not consent until there is a VERBAL, ENTHUSIASTIC, HONEST, SOBER, and MUTUAL “YES” given by both parties. It cannot be convinced. Kissing and other intimate actions are not consent. And consent must be given EVERY TIME! No matter if you’re married, have slept together before, or this is the first time. Also, consent must be asked and given EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. In other words, ITS OKAY TO CHANGE YOUR MIND. So many cases of sexual assault go unreported because victims are scared of how family and friends will react, confused about what consent really means, and scared of their assaulter. If we spoke more openly and supportively about these things, I believe more people would feel safe to do the right thing and report assault, and then less assault would take place! If you are a victim of sexual assault, I encourage you to reach out to support groups, law enforcement, family, friends, and/or to me. The more people speak, the less afraid we have to be and the more we do to end this problem-saving ourselves and so many others from future assaults. I believe this should be something that people discuss freely and openly without hesitation or “weirdness”. I encourage discussion in the comments on this post. Whether it’s agreement, questions, or whatever else. Start the discussion. I took the first step to speak out and I encourage everyone to do the same. Create a post on your own page. Talk to friends about sexual assault. It’s not easy, but it can save so many people. Think about 3 girls you know and realize the stats say it’s likely one of them have been sexually abused. #metoo ~Kristi 💕

Length: 6h 44m
Page count: 272

@rosemcgowan memoir / manifesto exposes the sexist industry that is Hollywood and the world in which we live. McGowan‚Äôs unique upbringing gave her an even more unique skill set to bring women together and stand up to unjust and unsafe societal norms women have to face daily.

Overall:
üëçüëç I read this book in less than 24 hours. To often when females are sexually assaulted people can be quick to say that the victim was asking for it or should have known better. McGowen does a great job in showing how this is never the case. Reading this book will bring up buried memories of moment where you knew something that was happening was not right. McGowen is so relatable and her message is extremely powerful. @rosemcgowen thank you for writing this book and sharing your story, the world really needed to hear your message and it will stay embedded in my soul.

Side note:
Rose McGowan is also a musician and if you listen to the audio book you can hear one of the songs at the beginning and end of the book.

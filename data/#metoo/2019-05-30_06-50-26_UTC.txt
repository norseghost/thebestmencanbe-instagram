Religion contributes largely to violence against women.

This popular verse, Ephesians 5:22 -23 is a scripture from the holy Bible - a collection of sacred scriptures. It says; wives, submit yourselves to your own husband as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Saviour. During church services and particularly marriage counseling, this verse is constantly used as a reminder to women that her job is to always submit to a man.

On the contrary, the verse went on to say; Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt get to hear much about the concluding part in most religious gatherings because men have designed religion to favour themselves.

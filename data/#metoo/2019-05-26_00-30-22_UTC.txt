When I Hit You by Meena Kandasamy 
Genre - Fiction yet also deeply personal as stems for her experiences 
Style - First person intense and fast, poetic, characters are devoid of names 
High point - The vividness, the urgency of Kandasamy’s writing - how easily the woman is made to disappear in her marriage, to be compliant, but then use her words to find her way out 
Low point - The woman is stripped of her voice and autonomy, reduced to the world of the domestic and sexual (at her husband’s whim), how the world around her responds (or doesn’t) 
Take away - Writing as hope, escape, and as salvation

"This was actually the first spoken word video I posted on Instagram. Being a survivor of trauma, most of my writing is based on what my healing process looks like. I wrote this when I read somewhere that nearly every woman has been subjected to harassment or abuse by the age of 25, which is absurd to me. The inspiration for this piece was based on my hope that one day, men and women can build healthier relationships with each other based on respect, healthy boundaries and equality." #writing #poets #poetsofig #poems #poetrycommunity #spokenword #inspo #inspiration #selflove #selfcare #femaleempowerment #metoo #traumasurvivors #dplwrites #throwbackpoem #actorlife #actor #filmlife

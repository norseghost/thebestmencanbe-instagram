he took my innocence
in his hands
choked me with it
and called it love
i still donâ€™t know
how to breathe
without fingers
gripping my throat

if my body is a map
i am all ocean
and i am drowning
in the places he made sure
you cannot touch
gentle hands cannot stand
against the raging seas
on my skin

this body is a panic button
only he knows how to press
suffocating me into silence
guilt ridden with shame
is this survival
or am i already dead? -jhm

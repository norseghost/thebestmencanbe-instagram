Last night watching @danielsloss at the barbican was incredible! If you haven't seen his Netflix specials or the new show, what the fuck is wrong with you!?! You NEED to see this show, I have never laughed so much, seen such amazing dark humour (the best kind of humour) and experienced the atmosphere change as drastically as it did in the latter half of the show! There were people around me who seemed to get agitated at the last part of the show, I worry as to the reason (if you've seen the show you'll know why). Personally I felt it was empowering, to those who seemed offended ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–• #danielsloss #slossnessmonster #itsnotaswitch #itchytits #comedy #comedyshow #metoo #letstalk #darkhumour #york #yorkbarbican #uk #vsco #ig #wewererightatthefront

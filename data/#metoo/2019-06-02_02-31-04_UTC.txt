When we keep the secret of our  abuse and oppression to ourselves, we become complicit with our abuser. They want us to stay silent. Freedom comes when we break the chains of our silence and speak up. That’s when we liberate ourselves from their fear.  It’s hard to do that, but when you do, you own your own freedom.  #freedomisaninsidejob #abuse #silence #speakingup #metoo

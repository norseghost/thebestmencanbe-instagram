‚Ä¢ 
The Word for This is ‚ÄúSHAME‚Äù
‚Ä¢ 
I cannot (still, will not)
pretend I didn‚Äôt
anticipate, dress and wait
by windows in
late-morning light,
dread and delight learning
early to curl into each other, white
tights not yet unclean,
back
(behind)
to the wall, resigned to
calculate the price
for which I‚Äôd sold my
right to be my own.
‚Ä¢ 
It was tempting to stay at the surface; I wanted to turn away, to focus on body image struggles over the years (now too, who am I kidding?), or the deep sense of failure at how body and brain are collapsing under the decades-old fire of fight/flight wiring that‚Äôs finally burning itself (and me) out, and wondering whether what‚Äôs left will have (has) any value.
‚Ä¢ 
See? A lot in there. But.
‚Ä¢ 
Children are sexually assaulted by family members in countless ways, and the shame of loving the person who hurt you, of having sought their love, is‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have a word for it. And because the behavior was sanctioned, open, seen by all, encouraged ‚Äì because I was shamed for being (over)sensitive, for not catering to his twisted needs, for having a body that didn‚Äôt deserve its own space (because it took up too much? is that possible?) ‚Äì even typing ‚Äúsexually assaulted‚Äù is a challenge, still. Is that the word for this?
‚Ä¢ 
I don‚Äôt have a word for the filth of the hug I owed as thanks for this gift or that, knowing his hands would squeeze and pinch and grab, the child willing to tolerate, not only because she wanted the toy or the doll, but because she was told it was all just his form of love.
‚Ä¢ 
Knowing contempt and anger were the only form of love I deserved.
‚Ä¢ 
I have to forgive her, forgive me (is the opposite of shame ‚Äúresilience‚Äù? the phrase needs examination). Because I‚Äôm still holding back from receiving the love that‚Äôs downstairs from me right now, no strings, no anger, no price point. Just relentlessly unconditional, and a safety that‚Äôs still too frightening to accept.

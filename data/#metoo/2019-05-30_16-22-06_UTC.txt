There are currently only 10 women serving as the highest representatives of their countries, out of a total of 152! Women represent 6,6% of the total number of Heads of State in the world 👎🏻
Women are just as capable and qualified as men. So why are they excluded? Time to step it up! Double tap if you agree ❤️
Notes: Only elected Heads of State have been taken into account; Slovakia elected Zuzana Caputova as President on 31 March, she will take office in June; Marshall Islands’ Hilda Heine holds positions of both Head of Government and Head of State.

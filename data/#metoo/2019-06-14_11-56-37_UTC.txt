A large chunk of women and girls feel entitled to men’s money. We raise our girls to be decent but somehow, we forget to teach them to be emotionally and financially independent.

A man asks a woman out on a date and she shows up with four of her friends. Once a man picks interest in a woman before she even makes any commitment, she uses that as an opportunity to extort from him first and most times, the answer is no. You are in a relationship with a man and anytime you visit and make love, you feel entitled to getting paid. A man is not entitled to pay for a woman’s toiletries, hair, airtime, cab fare e.t.c.

This standard society has set is what prevents a lot of women from getting to work and leaving abusive marriages. A lot of women are completely financially dependent on a man that if they decide to leave, they have nothing to fend for themselves or their children.

Women want equality only when it’s convenient. We fight for equal pay but when it’s to support a man with a bill in the home, the story changes.

Women need to stop putting so much pressure on men and get to work so they can assist the man in the home, especially a struggling man. No matter how wealthy a man is, he will always respect the woman that brings something to the table no matter how little.

Women, get to work!

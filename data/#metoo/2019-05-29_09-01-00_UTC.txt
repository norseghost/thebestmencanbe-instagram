After experiencing bullying, we can be skittish around people, particularly people we’ve met only recently.
˙
This is a reasonable response: most of us are more careful about locking up the house after we’ve been robbed.
˙
This response can make us more sensitive to comments intended as jokes, or to any feedback.
˙
You may also find that you feel naked when around groups of people, or in small groups where you feel you are going to be asked about your previous experiences.
˙
This can make it attractive to avoid people altogether.
˙
It can be useful to prepare a ‘go to’ for talking about your bullying experience. If you’re in a very new workplace, you can leave it out of the conversation altogether and announce that you moved because you ‘needed a change’.
˙
If you’re in the same workplace and the bullying has been resolved, you can decide whether to deflect and say that you ‘can’t talk about it’ or casually refer to it as ‘a bad patch’.
˙
Find something you feel comfortable with that will help you to avoid having to go into detail.

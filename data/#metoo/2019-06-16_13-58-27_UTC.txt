My latest pieces were made on denim in honor of Denim Day, a day of awareness-building for sexual assault and victim-blaming. **triggering content ahead** In Rome 1992, an 18-year-old girl was raped by a 42-year-old driving instructor who took her down an isolated road and forcefully raped her on the way to her first driving lesson. She reported the rape and the man was arrested, prosecuted, convicted, and in prisoner. However, in 1999, he was able to appeal the sentence, claiming that there was proof that they had consensual sex. His defense claimed that since she was wearing tight jeans, she would have had to remove them herself so she must have agreed to sex. His convictions were overturned and he was released from custody.

Cases like this speak to the massive issue of victim-blaming and other myths about why rape happens. Victim-blaming is only one of the reasons that out of 1000 surveyed sexual assaults, only 5 lead to convictions (DoJ 2017). All of us must spread awareness and compassion for those who have had their agency taken away and their boundaries violated. The most important element is believing them!

Fun fact: this is the first piece I’ve ever had sell for money! The proceeds from the silent auction it was in went to my workplace, supporting survivors of gender-based violence ☺️ Do what you can to make a difference — small or big —you have the power to make an impact!

"What is your Superpower?
CASEY: My enthusiasm and optimism â€“ I can get people on board with an idea, I can help my clients feel like the badasses they are, and I am good at freely and truthfully expressing my love and admiration for people.  I donâ€™t believe in holding back praise and positive attention from the people I love and respect.  The women in my sisterhood deserve to hear how awesome they are â€“ and Iâ€™m never faking it.  I genuinely believe in them, and that helps them believe in themselves.
JULIE: I can guess people's height visually about 99% of the time, and I can generally tell by ear where someone is from when I listen to how they speak."

The other day I caught myself on my phone several times while with my family while at dinner. I have been taking this luxury for granted. There are so many who don't have the ability to sit at a dinner table and eat with their families and would give anything for this all over the world. @wfpusa is a great organization that provides food assistance and a number of different humanitarian services to various countries around the world. They also have a strong social aspect, motivating women around the world and teaching them their worth, which is so so important, especially since this is something I am personally invested in and would love to help with in the future. In the time I was on my phone checking social media, I could have been having meaningful with my families or spending five seconds donating to @wfpusa so they are able to continue doing all the good they have been providing since 1962.

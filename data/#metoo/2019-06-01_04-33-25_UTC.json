Something I thought wouldn\u2019t happen. \nHealing can be tricky. It\u2019s not linear. \nJust when you think you\u2019re good...you\u2019re not. The process starts all over again. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s debilitating. It can cause you to lean on things you normally wouldn\u2019t lean on. You do things just to get by. \nI\u2019m not a crier. I never have been. But I\u2019ve cried more times than I count. I cry for what was lost and not know what\u2019s to come. \nI\u2019m not healed. I\u2019m not sure I ever will be, but I\u2019m hopeful, for once, that I can move on. That I can speak my truth even if people don\u2019t believe me. \nMy heart aches every damn day. I\u2019ve given up a lot just to be able to smile without forcing it. \nI\u2019m hopeful, even though I know I\u2019m gonna have days that are gonna suck. I\u2019m hopeful, even though I know I\u2019m gonna be happy one minute and cry the next. I\u2019m hopeful, even though someone took something form me that I can\u2019t get back. I\u2019m hopeful, that despite everything, I can still smile.\nI\u2019m hopeful, that as I become more comfortable sharing my story, I can help someone who is afraid to share theirs. \nMost of all I\u2019m hopeful that the small circle of people I have beside me believe me and are there for me. They love me and are there for me. They encourage me to stand strong. \nI\u2019m hopeful that I can regain control and not let it control me anymore. \nI may not ever be the same but I\u2019m making progress to become someone stronger than I was before. \n#survivor #metoo #speakup #youarenotalone #ibelieveyou"

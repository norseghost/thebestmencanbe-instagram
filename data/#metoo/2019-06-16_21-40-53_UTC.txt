“It is a classic case of rich man’s justice,” said Boies. Add the fact that wealthy predators often target victims in financial need. That was allegedly Epstein’s M.O. as he sent recruiters into working-class neighborhoods in search of teenagers to give him “massages.” The rich exploit the poverty of their victims to extract promises of silence — backed by the force of law because the NDAs are binding contracts.

What’s needed is a simple change to the law, Boies contends: “Simply say that agreements to conceal evidence of a crime are not enforceable.” The Epstein case is particularly creepy but not unique. The #MeToo movement has revealed the pernicious misuse of NDAs to enable crime. Powerful men such as producer Harvey Weinstein and television executive Leslie Moonves reportedly made use of the agreements to hide evidence of sexual assault or harassment. This secrecy in turn allowed offenders to target additional victims.

That’s where the public interest comes in. Crime is not just a matter between an offender and a victim; crime is also an offense against the public order. The public has an important stake in punishing past crimes and preventing future offenses. Purchased secrecy interferes with those aims.

Some attorneys say NDAs are the only protection the rich and famous have against unfounded accusations. But that doesn’t bear much scrutiny. A person who might falsely claim to be a victim has more to fear from sunlight than from secrecy. And anyone who pays hush money to cover up false allegations is only encouraging more extortion.

I am beginning to worry that the fresh breeze of openness that appeared to be blowing through the stink of the Epstein case might be smothered by secrecy. Attorneys for Epstein’s Palm Beach accusers are losing confidence that their clients will ever tell their stories in court.

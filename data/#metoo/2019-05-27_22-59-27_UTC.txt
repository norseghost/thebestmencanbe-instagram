For years I was trapped in my anxiety. Not able to get a hold of myself. Each day I felt myself slowly sinking into a deeper depression. With each panic attack I felt my life passing by at the speed of light yet in motionless state.
.
During this time my biggest question was Why? Why me? Why is this happening? Why can't I just get over this? Why won't this just leave me? WHY?!
.
The Why question kept me stuck, kept me in bondage to the thoughts and feelings I was suffering with. The Why was holding me hostage!
.
What I learned from this experience is that I needed to hit rock bottom, I needed to get to the point in my life that I was ready to work through the real issues that were driving the anxiety, intrusive thoughts,  and panic attacks.
.
As I started to get real with myself, and others, I was then able to start the healing process. 10yrs into this process and I have to say that I've come to embrace this time as it has changed me into a person I could have never been.

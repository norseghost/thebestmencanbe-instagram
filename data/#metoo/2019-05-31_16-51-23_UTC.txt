I got giddy. Doesn't usually happen to me. BUT

THIS was my highlight of my day and week. What an amazingly beautiful real, raw, authentic, funny, inspirational woman creating BIG change. .

Tarana is the REAL deal with a big mission. 
I look forward to possibilities with @taranajaneen.

Thank you for BE-ing you. Alone we are strong. Together, we are so much darn stronger. .

With so much appreciation,

PS. Yes that look is Tarana trying to figure out how she knows me and my response.  This picture made me smile as there is such a story here.

"Trips that you plan for the whole next week..." Would I even be a real #Torontonian if I wasn't posting random photos with Drake lyrics for captions? More seriously though, I have actively avoided Chris Brown songs since allegations of abuse against him surfaced so many years ago. Releases like this with top dog artists like Drake are problematic and frankly, disgusting. Where does one go when even someone as pervasive like Drake collaborates with Chris Brown despite not just allegations, but actual proven cases and convictions of abuse against women? He was arrested as recently as 2018 for battery. The shocking part I think is that after all this, people really say *women* need to be careful when claiming abuse against men? Allegations can derail men's careers? How? When? Is it because Chris Brown's victims were largely black women? Discussions and dialogues are so important. Silence is lethal. Truly.

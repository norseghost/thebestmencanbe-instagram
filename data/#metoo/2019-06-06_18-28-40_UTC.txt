We are always in favor of legislation that protects children from sex abuse and penalizes predators to the FULL EXTENT of the law. In regards to this legislation, please keep in mind that all predators don’t thrive on sexual desire. Some thrive on seeing others in pain and they thrive on committing acts of violence and control. In addition, without proper oversight, the parolee can take supplements to try and override the chemical castration process.
Therefore, we don’t want anyone, especially parents, to assume that this will “fix the problem” and let down your guard. Parents keeping their kids AWAY from predators and understanding how to identify predatory behavior and protecting their kids from it through deliberate and intentional measures has to continue to be our focus.

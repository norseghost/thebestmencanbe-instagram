My "Women Empowerment" look...when I got my hair this far back, tight and tucked in...no earrings, assertive...you know it's on! Today I represented women, children and men everywhere scared to stand up due to the consequences, due to lack of resources or support. I'm here for all my people! I saved lives today, alongside mine and I'm going to continue to make this my mission, my passion for the rest of my days.  #strong #reslient #enough 💪♀️#women #love #endabuse #advocate #survivor #mama #justice #metoo #wonderwoman #sexualabuse #domesticviolence #domesticviolenceawareness #stillgoingbadonemanyway #women

if you EVER say you are ashamed of your skin, i get it. i won’t tell you to just stop and embrace your skin bc it’s not easy. and that’s okay, it will take time. i hope that one day you learn to accept and embrace the skin you grew up hating bc it really is who you are. you should be proud of you who are. and i know you might not be sometimes, bc the media makes you believe you’re not beautiful. well, fuck that bullshit. no matter how light or dark your natural skin is, you are beautiful. don’t let other people decide you’re not. lol okay sorry for making that sappy bye. {m}

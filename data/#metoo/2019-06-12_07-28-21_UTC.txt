#Repost @equalitynoworg “For a woman to be sexual was seen as a sin, for her to have pleasure was a sin." Most people think FGM is something that doesn’t happen in the #UnitedStates, but they’re wrong. 
Jenny grew up in a strict Christian community in #Oklahoma, and was just five when she was subjected to FGM, along with her older sister. Now in her 40s, Jenny is one of the few women raised Christian in the U.S. to come forward with a story of being subjected to FGM. Like Jenny, another Christian survivor, Renee Bergstrom, now in her 70s, was subjected to FGM in a Church clinic. There are already an estimated half a million women and girls in the United States who are at risk of or have been subjected to FGM in the United States. Stories like Jenny’s could be just be beginning of understanding those numbers even further. 
Physical abuse, sexual assault and control of women’s sexuality are global issues, and must be treated as such.

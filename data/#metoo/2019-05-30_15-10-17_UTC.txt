It was movie night last evening. Holy shit. Darrell Hammond unfolds his childhood trauma story. Riveting. Telling. It’s an epidemic folks. Quit hiding.  Only when we are we willing to shine a light on the darkness can we emerge into our (own) healing. More to share soon. Bickford Covington will be speaking more on this epidemic. It’s hard because we have to first overcome the shame and hiding. #trauma #shame #consciousculture #conscious-culture #safechurch #metoo #kavanaugh #outthem

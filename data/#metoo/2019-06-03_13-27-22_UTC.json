                        "text": "Consent - noun.\npermission for something to happen or agreement to do something...ONLY VALID WHEN HUMANS ARE INVOLVED. Its ruins the beauty of these beautiful landscapes of pure creation when I noticed there is a human element in it. At first, I saw this landscape, the sea and the sunset behind it while driving at 100kmph and then after a while I looked down and closer. This flock grazing looked unusually thin with respect to all the food around them and I stopped the car to take this photo. Getting out of the car I felt the difference, it was around 10-15 degrees outside. As I went a bit off the road closer to them the gave me this stare in the eye from behind the fence and started walking away from me. It's like when you see a person on the street person who is out of his/her mind and you start walking away from them or when you feel insecure of someone\u2019s presence around you. The truth is we are that mentally ill/dangerous person from whom animals want to stay away. Recently, consent has become a trending topic. Especially in terms of physical sense. It's funny that there is a book full of consent involved for us in relation to another person but stripping another being NAKED (shaving the sheep) and leaving them out in the cold with no shelter around is ABSOLUTELY FINE. Hanging half a ton being, on one leg upside down and cutting their throat with a blunt knife while they are still conscious is ABSOLUTELY FINE. We having their \u201cconsent\u201d of killing them and worse, making their life miserable! on paper! And then the species who have yet not understood their own brain DECLARED them as the most intelligent species on earth!\n#conservation \n#metoo \n#natgeo @natgeo @wwf"

McDonald’s, the largest restaurant company in the world with 1 million employees in the U.S. alone, has a sexual harassment problem that has long gone unchecked. Yesterday 25 new lawsuits and charges were filed accusing them of condoning sexual harassment in the workplace and retaliating against employees who speak up.⁣ These cooks and cashiers make $9/hr on average.⁣
⁣
I received a letter from @mcdonaldscorp CEO Steve Easterbrook stating that McDonald’s has reprinted and shipped posters to all their restaurants with their sexual harassment policy and that they’ve “encouraged” their owner operators to comply. This is a start, but McDonald’s needs to do way more than just ‘encourage’. ⁣⁣⁣

I teamed up with @timesupnow, the @aclu and #fightfor15 do something about this epidemic. Please sign in bio to help!  #timesup #metoo #sexualharassment #mcdonalds

Thanks to @mattfagerholm and @killerandasweetthang for this in depth conversation with @isabellefur and @annarosafm about @tape_themovie ...“For me as a filmmaker, Tape was about trying to find a cinematic language that shifts from the male gaze to the female experience—not the female gaze because for me, as a woman, it’s not ever about the gaze, it’s about the experience.“ link to full interview in bio. #femalefilmmakerfriday #tapethemovie #metoo #tellthetruth

I've gotta admit: I'm a bit nervous about this episode, and not just because of all the accents in the name Thérèse. Our penultimate episode of this season deals with a BIG and important topic: the #MeToo movement and its ramifications for the art world. Our current #ArtCurious episode circles around a work of art that has long been accepted (or at least tolerated) within one of the U.S.'s top art institutions, and only in recent years has it become a problem. It has led to some serious questions, too: should we judge an artist's work within his/her/their time period and milieu? How does a work's meaning change with our contemporary perspectives?

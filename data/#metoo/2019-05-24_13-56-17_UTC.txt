What heals you?

Water always heals me! I've not had a break in over a year, a year filled with confronting my narcissistic maternal granmother and dealing with her highly toxic responses to my new boundaries, losing my granfather suddenly to cancer and the grief that was constantly interrupted by my granmother character assassination. I've grown ive learnt to let people believe what they wish. Those who know me know I bend over backwards and sacrifice myself and my sanity in the process. Learning to have healthy boundaries with my family has been a very painful learning process but it's been an essential one! Seeing healthier ways of being, experiencing a life without the pressure of living upto unattainable narcissist standards is so odd and surreal to me! We get so used to the bs our parents never dealt with we don't even realise we are allowed our freedom! As this water flowed away from me I gave it my worries, the false bs expectations of my family and the lies I've internalised as fact. I am allowed to be 100% me, I'm allowed to be proud of my growth, my journey, my healing. And you are too! Feed your cares to the waters, cry them out and wash your soul, splash about in a bath tub if that's all you've got, do a happy dance in the shower as you release the weight of others ideals, other's issues and preconceived notions! You're amazing! You CAN and will and are absolutely allowed to thrive in your own wayüòäüôè! #nfiniteheart #t3lesto #mentalhealth #trauma #MeToo #healing #survivornotvictim #fighter #cptsdwarrior #counselling #fight #youvegotthis #strong #rest #relentless #brave #time #water #LakeDistrict #love #bethegood #nature #adventure #you #allowed #amazing #shortbreak

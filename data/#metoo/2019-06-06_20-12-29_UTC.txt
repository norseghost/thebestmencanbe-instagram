You have a voice and no, you don't need a microphone to use it.
You are ultimately the only one who can share your story that can provide yourself and others with closure.

I recently opened up about my domestic violence story with an article titled, "#metoo" which received a lot of feedback both positive and negative.

That article provided myself with closure, and set me free.
.
It's your turn beautiful.

The #Metoo Movement was a very good initiative which gave women a platform where they could come ahead and voice their opinion against sexual abuse, harassment and so on. Having said that, even men come across such unpleasant experiences. Many are exonerated, some with honourable acquittals, but the damage to their reputation, careers, life and family is irreparable. #Mentoo aims to put the brakes on alarmingly rising numbers of false cases by focusing on protecting the identity of both victims & accused until proven guilty. It is a movement that protects society, men, women and families without discrimination and is a movement for a free, equal and respectful society that will bring law, order and punishment to the guilty irrespective of the gender.

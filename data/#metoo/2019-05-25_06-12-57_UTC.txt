Business As Usual (1987, 87min) plus An Epic Poem (1982, 27min)
When Babs (Glenda Jackson), the manageress of a Liverpool fashion store, confronts the area manager about his sexual harassment of one of her staff (Cathy Tyson), she is promptly sacked. The incident exacerbates existing friction at home between her unemployed ex-shop steward husband (John Thaw) and her left-wing son (Mark McGann), who quarrel over tactics for fighting her unfair dismissal. This being Thatcher-era Britain, it's definitely a job for the union, and a little working-class solidarity goes a long way. It's a truthful, uplifting portrait of the changing attitudes towards women and their rights, the main theme being Babs' awakening to an untapped inner strength and confidence.

Lezli-An Barrett is a writer-director who throughout her career has encountered the discriminatory film industry practices typically faced by female film-makers. Business as Usual is rarely-screened and at present unavailable to buy for home viewing, despite featuring a number of very recognisable acclaimed actors. Business as Usual positively showcases Liverpool of the 1980s and celebrates the resilience, dignity and spirit of the people. The subject matter of sexual harassment is more relevant than ever in the era of the #MeToo movement, we are excited to show Business as Usual to a new audience. We will also screen Lezli-An’s earlier short film An Epic Poem (1982) and we are thrilled to announce that she will be taking part in a Q&A after the screening.

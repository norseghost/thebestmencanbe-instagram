Gillibrand has been one of the leading voices of the #MeToo movement. Sheâ€™s also pro-choice, and an advocate for affordable child care. Her track record is conservative but clearly sheâ€™s become quite liberal. She is also a practicing Catholic but claims to disagree with many of its views like LGBTQ and reproductive rights.

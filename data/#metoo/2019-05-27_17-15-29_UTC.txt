they sayin the future is female, sayin #timesup #metoo - everybody needs their platform to speak their truth - shift minds and shake up culture, change the narrative we live thru.

Lately I feel my patience wearing thin.
My frustration is in learning perseverance in the midst of systemic oppressive powers that be. Progress can be a slow pill to swallow, even slower to digest. I'm just outchyea trying to fight for spaces, funding, recognition and visibility for my peoples and our communities. I just want us to have a seat at the table to speak on the future that will affect us, not be spoken for by colonized white minds with capitalist agendas.

But maybe that's the game we gotta play. Get on some social entrepreneurial type type and create a sustainable economy for ourselves, be our own goddamn gatekeepers to the opportunities and spaces we need in order to Thrive. We BEEN stayin alive. I'm ready for that next step that comes after #metoo that comes after #timesup that future I want now so bad it hurts cuz I feel the world's pain in my heart.

To the powers that be, Maybe imma let u keep that seat warm for us, cuz eventually people in power get old, and people Gunna die. Cycle of life. I'll be ready, mind and heart healthy, the last of the millenials - but we lookin to Generation Z on the rise.

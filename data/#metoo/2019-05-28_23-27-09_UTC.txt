Self-care Is a journey, and the first step is to simply acknowledge that you deserve to be loved and cared for. Do you feel like you’re struggling to get through the day? You’re not alone. I've felt and been through it all.

The journey of spiritual healing began in 2016 when facing several life circumstances head on and began to witness how life was being directed from places of abuse: emotional, physical and mental including substance abuse. After recieving a very powerful wake up call from struggling with PTSD, eating disorders, physical and substance abuse and the many challenges that correlated with them. As these challenges were becoming increasingly loud, I came very close to ending it all. After reaching out to a colleague in the field, I was introduced to Sacred Journey Therapy, Energy Healing facilitated through Cranial Sacral Therapy. 
I fell in love with the work and enrolled at The Sacred Journey Institute located in Illinois. Soon after, throughout this training I anchored in how changing my life meant living from the present and not the past. Not only was I able to lift myself out of a very dark time, I created an illuminated shift from deeply buried patterning and cycles that contribute to keeping an individual locked into pains and suffering. Sometimes very harsh circumstances. 
After looking fear and evil in the face, I have immense gratitude for what it has given me in return. The opportunity to help others and cherish my spiritual gifts  is an incredible blessing. 
Life is sweet. Live fearlessly. Love unconditionally.

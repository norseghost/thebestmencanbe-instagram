Inspiring words from Tarana Burke, the civil rights activist who founded the Me Too Movement. In 2006 Burke began using the phrase “Me Too” to raise awareness of the pervasiveness of sexual abuse in our society. “We come to this work because we are this work” she shared with delegates at #copesepb2019 convention delegates. #algonquinterritory #anishnabeterritory #taranaburke @taranajaneen #metoo #metoomovement @moveuptogether #inspiration #leadership #canlab #union #womensrightsarehumanrights #blackandwhite #nikonz6 #lifeontheroad #socialactivist

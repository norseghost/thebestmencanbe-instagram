I’ve revisited so many magical spots in Asia after first discovering them 6 years ago during my year long trip, but Gili T (and Bali of course) hold an especially profound place in my heart 💜 I landed here almost by chance after surviving a traumatic and heartbreaking experience. I came looking for healing, looking to ground, and looking to put the pieces back together, and this island delivered - above and beyond the call of duty. I felt nourished, I felt nurtured; I was moved by the natural beauty, the peaceful pace, the wonderful people that I met, and the sensation of spirituality in the air and in the ocean. I opened myself again, and started to work towards regaining my ability to trust in this world; and most of all, I just felt so damn happy to be alive. My time here breathed new life into me, and gave me a gratitude that I never knew was possible for this #onepreciouslife 🙏🏼 #metoo #thankyou #trust #neverstopexploring

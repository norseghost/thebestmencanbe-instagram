We save nearly everything from losing lottery tickets to parking tickets to receipts. Every time we see a photo booth, we stop and take pictures. Are we hoarders? Possibly 😂 But I’ve made a scrapbook full of this “junk” I’ve saved up over the years. We look over it together and smile knowing one day we’ll be able to show it to our children and they can see just how cool their momma’s used to be 😛

I’m gonna share some photos of the scrapbook in my story so you guys can see it! •

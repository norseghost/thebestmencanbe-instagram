Believe it or not, I was once an extremely shy, scared and timid little girl... For the past several weeks I‚Äôve been taking the time to review my life and write my story to share how I went from being very afraid of expressing myself and being SEEN To following my dream of being a singer and rocking Mic‚Äôs üé§ on stages fearlessly for over 25 years now. Shizzzz!

I‚Äôve heard that it‚Äôs known to be a life transforming experience to write your own story and look at your past with fresh eyes -seeing how far you‚Äôve come.. And now I‚Äôm experiencing just that. There‚Äôs so much I want to share with you guys and I‚Äôm going to save it for my talk this Saturday morning and San Francisco at the @alcazartheatre 
So, If you‚Äôre a woman or someone who identifies as such, or simply just a male or other ally who loves & respects  women and wants to learn more about our inner workings then Come and experience my talk + performance with new music. 
And come check out @ginahatzis @mariacardenas976 @lusciousluciapavone @cindymanit @msmichellemeow and @dr.abiola and this blessed collective 
of mighty women of all backgrounds and ages sharing stories of how we‚Äôre growing through the unexpected, & often unbelievable challenges into our potential.

I had no idea how amazing and powerful this too much woman event was going to be until I got off the phone last night after my first call with these beautiful women and some elders  who are LIVING & PRACTICING  their truths  unapologetically to help make this world a better place for all.

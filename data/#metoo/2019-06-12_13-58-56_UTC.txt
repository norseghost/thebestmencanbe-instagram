Thank you @JenWilkin for tackling this important passage and the issue of silencing those who have been abused, assaulted, harassed, or mistreated. I have seen this especially in school and church settings. I’m sad to say that I have lost count of the women I know personally that experienced this in life. The #metoo movement covered a broad spectrum, of which I am included. And I did receive advice to “ignore it” “don’t report it” or “change your behavior” the few times I told someone to get help. 
Unsettling as it is, the #churchtoo movement is cross denominational. None of us can truly claim, “not my church, not my school, not my community, not my family.” The statistics, both male & female, tell a different story. The victim shaming is also predictable and a main reason why victims stay silent. 
I’m am a huge proponent of bringing these pains into the light, so that healing can happen. The value of solid counseling, prayer, and a supportive community cannot change the past, but can bring healing to the wounds and allow the victims to thrive as survivors. 
To the countless survivors I know- I pray that you would know the freedom from releasing the secret, experience true healing from the trauma, and be overwhelmed with hope for your future.  https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/june/tamar-jen-wilkin-absalom-david-1-samuel.html?share=LevQyE853ESY%2bvnFblyfoxBZQoQPj0SZ

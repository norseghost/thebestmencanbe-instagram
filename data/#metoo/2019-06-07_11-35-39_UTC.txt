The three very different artists which we are showing @bundeskunsthalle right now have at least one thing in common: their work challenged/challenge the norms and values of their time. 
POWER PLAY. Anna Uddenberg, until 22 September 
By identifying, distorting, ironizing and exacerbating particular components, structures and stereotypes generally associated with comfort and cosiness, the artist turns conventional readings of femininity upside down and demonstrates that these encodings serve the enjoyment of others, and that femininity is often still associated with exploitation – here as well, reference is made to the viral #MeToo debate.

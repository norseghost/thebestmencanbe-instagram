“I fell to my knees and slumped against the side of the shower. Through my tears, I leaned forward, resting my forehead on the bottom of the tub with my arms stretched out in front of me. It was then, in horror, that I saw the bruises on my wrists. A small ring of greenish brown had formed around the base of both hands, and I could no longer think clearly. What did it all mean? Where did I go from here? I couldn’t run away. We were not only roommates, he was my best friend - the only friend whom I could tell my secrets without fear of judgement. Where could I go? To whom could I turn now that HE had hurt me?” -R.

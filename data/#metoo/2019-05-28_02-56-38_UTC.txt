I would mix it with half pumpkin seed  protein powder which makes a bigger more economical supply. Often $25 for a large bag of Raw Pumpkin seed where is this is about $45 so if you put the two together you'd be stretching the bone broth protein powder and bringing in a keto Raw-Raw element. Or go 100% Raw plant-based protein powder by skipping the pricey blends that often are filled with grains like rice. And is totally amazing SuperFood nutbase when ultra clean, naked & protien rich ! The best price on this Axe product is at Sprouts but I'll also be ordering them wholesale when I am complete setting up the little Superfood Co-Op! #craveadifferentkindofbuzz

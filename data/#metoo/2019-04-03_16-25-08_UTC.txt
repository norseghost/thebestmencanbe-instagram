Partagás Lusitania was named after RMS Lusitania, a British Ocean Liner - a civilian ship -  that was sunk by German U-boats in 1915. This incident changed the US outlook on the war, given the fact that 128 American citizens were killed. It’s considered to be the turning point of America’s decision to enter the Great War and a major event in world history.

Song of Daughters
LYRICS:
What you built was trying to destroy us
The sun grows warm and brighter every day
Distract, despise, define and deploy us
We’re still the wave that’s coming out to play, to play
So clear the way

Did you think we’d sit around obeying
While on the ground, the sand just slipped away
Surprised you’d sink as low as you’re displaying
But we have found the chains have deep decay, we broke your cage
So clear the way

We’re closing in, the wheels will change direction
Our fathers’ sins, will rot into the earth
And tumbling down, the greedy gold erections
With every daughter born to know her worth, and have her say
So clear the way

Well did you think we’d keep the blindfolds tied up tight
And wear these gags around our mouths without a fight
Beneath your feet, we feed on iron to bear your weight
And now we’re rising from your dirt, so clear the way, clear the way

We rise, we rise….so clear the way
Surprise, surprise….so clear the way
Come face to face…so clear the way
We’ll take our place…so clear the way

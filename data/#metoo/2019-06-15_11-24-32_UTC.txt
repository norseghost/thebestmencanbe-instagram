Yolk of me ..... You proclamations of my unequal worth
Due to the privileges I incur, due to the form of me
Shackles me
You hold your masculinity like a trophy over me 
You reason my biology
Tying me to sinking sands
Binding me in your short sighted views
That limit me
Neutralize me

You cut me to the core
Dissemble me
Turn my insides, Inside out
Rip out the yolk of me 
From me
Tranquilize me

You drown my femininity in high tides
For this womb inside me
Devalues me, for you
You ask less of woman 
For you

This form of me
This sinew
Just a vessel to be used
My end predetermind
Iâ€™m a full gone conclusion
To you
You tie my ending with a noose of my femininity 
Ready to hang my
Hopes and dreams with your steadfast impenetrable opinions
Inflexible in your stance
As hard as steel
Ready to break me

You domesticate me with your opinions
Inequality is nature you say
Common disparities you say
Tick tock
Your watching my clock
Your sight cannot see past the mist 
That clouds you
Your glass ceiling
With your reinforced views
Pigeon hole me
This womb it seems
Will trap me
I think
How unfair
Your lack of responsibility
Unburden me
Unshackle my femininity

You speak without shame
Using our differences to
Suffocate me
You tell me
This is the way
Fall inline
Line me with the grit 
To break your common sense
Make me turn your stark views
That cut the form of me
To see me more than a woman born to breed 
Tick tock

You cut me to the core
You will always see my footsteps fading in the sand
Cut your views from a different cloth
Unshackle me

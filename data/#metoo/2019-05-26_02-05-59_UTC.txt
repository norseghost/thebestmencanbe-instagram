Rape is a physical, emotional and mental violence! Some victims of rape wonder about their specific circumstance and wonder if it constitutes rape. Chances are if you're wondering, "was I raped?" you probably were. Rape happens any time sexual intercourse takes place without your consent. Note that many circumstances can indicate your lack of consent including: -An inability to give consent due to age
-An inability to give consent due to diminished capacity (perhaps due to a disability)
-An inability to give consent due to inebriation (typically due to ingesting drugs or alcohol) #MeTooEthiopia #Rape #RapeCulture #MeToo #Ethiopia #metoo #metoomovement #metooafrica #metooethiopia #survivor #ethiopian #ethiopia #women #men #change #breakthesilence #yourenotalone

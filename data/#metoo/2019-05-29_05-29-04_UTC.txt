I always felt weird when people told me it wasn’t my fault. Like there was something deep within that needed it to be my fault. Turns out, feeling guilty about trauma is our brain’s coping mechanism.
If you feel guilty, that means you had a choice. If you had a choice, that means you were responsible for it happening. If you’re responsible for it then you could stop it from happening again.
And that gives us a feeling of control that quite frankly we did not have at the time. The truth that we had no control is difficult to come to terms with and should be discussed with a licensed professional that can assist you in sorting through it. You don’t need to feel guilty for feeling guilty. You are coping. You are moving forward. You are loved. You are cared about. You have hope. You are a survivor.

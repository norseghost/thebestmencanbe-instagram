So I wouldn‚Äôt normally post things like this however I felt disgusted receiving a few videos overnight of a man sending me unwanted, absolutely horrendous videos of him pleasuring himself.

So as a 29 year old, there are things from my past that I would have hoped we would grow out of. It seems that one thing that still follows me around is the receiving of UNWANTED DICK PICS!

Not only did I receive a disgusting and appalling video as per my screenshot below, when I sent what I did, he proceeded to respond saying ‚Äúsorry wrong person‚Äù yet he has sent them to me before? Before you ask, YES I did block him and NO it‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve received something of the same nature recently.

I keep a lot of my social media public for personal interest and a hobby (especially Instagram) but I cannot explain to you how disgusting it is to STILL be receiving such unwanted, putrid and crappy messages. 
Men, if you read this and you‚Äôre considering sending these types of messages or videos to women, please consider; have they asked for it? Have they consented? Is it going to offend that person?

IF I receive them again, I will continue to name and shame! 
Happy Thursday all! üòä

May is Sexual Assault Awareness month, and I promised myself I would always write about sexual assault to make sure they are part of everyday conversations so that people can realize the full ramifications of what sexual assault does to one's life, but more importantly so that people who have experienced an assault never feel alone.
.
This is the fourth year for me doing this, and this year, I have to admit, I am not really feeling up to the challenge anymore.
.
Working with someone over the past several months – who has likely helped me more than anyone over the past almost 15 years - I am starting to see how what happened to me has become an identity that I wear almost all the time because it gives me an excuse to not follow my dreams, essentially it has become a comfortable sweater that protects me from living. .
The identity I was given and accepted on that day in July 2004 is one I have used to make excuses for my failures and for everything that goes wrong in my life since.  It allows me to live in a world filled with anger that has done nothing, but destroy relationships, but also me.
.
Let me try to explain….with what will likely be a really long post! .
Over the weekend, the person I work with helped me do an exercise related to one of the sounds that has bothered me for a long time – the clicking of the deadbolt lock from that day.  That sound has haunted me for almost 15 years.
.
So, why am I telling you this…
.
My ‘coach’ had me take that memory/sound/vision and merge it with a good thought, good sounds, good memory, and here is where things went weird. .
First, I took the sound and the lock and buried it in a beautiful forest where I walk sometimes, which is what my good memory was.  I could clearly see the pile of dirt that I dug for the lock, I knew that I had put the lock in the hole, I could see the dirt put back and covered with leaves – like a freshly dug grave. What I did to the lock should have contained the lock and silenced it completely, but it didn’t, the noise only got louder and wouldn’t go away. (Continued below)

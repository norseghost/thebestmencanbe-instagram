{Gifted} thank you so much to @livmarmar at @4thestatebooks for sending me this proof copy of My Dark Vanessa 🌸⁣
Touted as a 21st century Lolita, I picked this up yesterday and flew through the first half. While this is by no means an easy read, it’s compelling, compulsive and deeply unsettling. Set in 2017 at the peak of the #MeToo movement, Vanessa is forced to redefine the great love story of her life as abuse, irrevocably altering her entire identity. ⁣
It owes a great debt to Nabokov, Poe and Wharton but instead of being a weakness I thought this frame of reference only added to the overall power of the narrative. A barnstorming debut and a completely unputdownable read, My Dark Vanessa publishes next January and I’m sure it will be one of the books of 2020 💭

- The reason I want to speak is because I want women to live like people, please let women live like human beings.
- I don't wait for someone to tell me about my rights, but I want you to shout in your voice.
- No one can live my life on my behalf.
- Even if the speed is different, I want you to think deeply about which direction a woman can truly live as a human being.

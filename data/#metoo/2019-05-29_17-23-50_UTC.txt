I took the advice of one of my guests (and friends) @stefanossifandos and decided to go hit things for long periods of time! It feels so great to fully engage my entire body and power for an hour at a time, and then collapse on the floor afterwards in a pool of sweat.

I'm pushing myself out of my comfort zone. Will you all share with us the ways that you are doing the same?

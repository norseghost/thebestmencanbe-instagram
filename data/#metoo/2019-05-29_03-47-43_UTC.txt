I happened to see a few articles like this and all i can really say is that if true this gives us a different side of MLK Jr that we have never seen before. Either way this is a bit of a WTF. But can an icon like him really have done it? It seems kinda sketchy that these audio tapes by the FBI were revealed only recently around the time when the #metoo movement is around (#metoo is a movement for awareness of rape, but in some cases men have been falsely accused and lose their reputation and future, while the accuser, exposed or not, loses almost nothing). Why now? Why did the FBI decide to suddenly let the world know that MLK Jr watched a rape happen and not tell us before? This is the FBI we are talking about, the same organization that can uncover a truth can also cover up another. These are just my thoughts, and i may be wrong, but i would like to hear some opinions.

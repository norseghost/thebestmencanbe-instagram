“Men, too, have a part in the redeeming work of God and a role in what’s being done in the church in the area of church abuse. ... As we work to be more like Jesus, we need to give our brothers the opportunity to respond appropriately while we learn from the male leaders that have been wrong in the past.” – @meganlively

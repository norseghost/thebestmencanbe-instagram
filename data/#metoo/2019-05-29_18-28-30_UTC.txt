In the #MeToo movement, actor @terrycrews has been one of the loudest male voices to speak out about his reported sexual abuse, and he told Bold TV, “I’m an accidental activist. I just literally ended up in a spot, and I looked around, and I was like ‘Who’s gonna do something about this?’ And it was me. I was the only one standing there!” Bold TV caught up with Crews and his wife, Rebecca King Crews, at the 2019 Shorty Awards, where Crews received the Phenom Award for his activism.

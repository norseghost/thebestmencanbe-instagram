Rosie Batty was yesterday appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in recognition of her service to the community as a campaigner and advocate for the prevention of family violence. We are so grateful for everything Rosie has contributed to the conversation about family violence in Australia, and are glad to see her work honoured and recognised in this way.

We are also glad to see Rosie honoured amongst other incredible women in the Australian honours system. We are calling for more women to be nominated and honoured, in line with the work of #HonourAWoman. You can read more about their work at honourawoman.com

Oh hey! It’s me! Chilling in the @nytimes :) I am incredibly honored to be featured in a piece on campus activism in The New York Times! A lot of ups and downs had to happen in order for me to transform from being a "pot-stirrer" in high school to an activist fighting for what I believe is right. Thank you to every single person that has raised their voice, stood beside Culture of Consent, and to those that silently support us in the background. I cannot wait to see what my last year at Rhodes College will hold. Let's make change and continue to #AskForBetter! “The #AskForBetter was our way of taking the #MeToo movement to the next step,” Ms. Bako said. “It was not only ‘me too,’ but ‘here’s what I want to follow after that, these are our demands, what we want. Listen to us.’” Link is in my bio! #nytimes #AskForBetter #MeToo #MavenGirl

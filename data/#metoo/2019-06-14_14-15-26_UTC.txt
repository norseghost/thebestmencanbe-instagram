Peckish started with a 20 something year old girl crying tears of joy, sitting at her retail job, watching the news and hearing that same sex marriage had been legalized in all fifty states. -
Peckish started when that same 20 something year old girl heard the stories of women all around her cry out in unison for the #MeToo movement. - 
Peckish started when that same 20 something year old girl cried tears of sadness and support watching Dr. Ford share her story. -
Peckish started when that same 20 something year old girl became angry and outraged by the abortion bans popping up around the U.S. -
Peckish started when that 24 year old girl was no longer happy fitting into the mold of a 9-5. Peckish started when she realized she could be doing so much more in this world. -
Peckish started with small fires and small curiosities that became big dreams and will turn into even better legacies. ❤️

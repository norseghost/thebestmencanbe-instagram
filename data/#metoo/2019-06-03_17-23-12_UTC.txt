A special thank you to the Ladies Ministry at Northside Church of Christ in Riverside for welcoming RARCC to the 3rd Annual, “You too? Speak Up”. Events like these provide a safe space for our communities to speak on sexual assault and how to prevent it. Amazing job ladies, we admire your love and care for the Riverside community! .

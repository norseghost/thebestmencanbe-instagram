Reposting this amazing message of unity and love.  The word “Yoga” is Sanskrit for ‘to yoke’ to unify mind, body, and spirit.  Yogic practice brings us to “samadhi” - a state of union with the divine (however YOU define that). Union is the end game. And there is no union with the divine that doesn’t include every other living and divine creature on the planet. Period. #yoga4change_ #yoga4changeofct #yogact #hamdenct #hamdenconnecticut #nonprofityoga #loveistheanswer #mindfulnessct #mindfulness #blacklivesmatterct #metoo #ctnature #kindnessmatters #nohumanisillegal

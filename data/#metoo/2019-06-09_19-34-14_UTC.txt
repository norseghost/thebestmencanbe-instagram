Flutra...pronounced 'flutura'...is the Kosovan / Albanian word for butterfly ü¶ã Possibly my spirit animal and a word I love to learn in every language. This is the view over Prizren where I ran 16kms for #footstepstoinspire on Saturday 8 June. I chose Prizren over Prishtina because there is a lovely river trail...hihihi little did I know it led to the top of this hill and I had to run up it 3 times üòù Prizren is a city with a long, fascinating history, a cross-over of ethnicity and lots of natural surrounds. Many people only come to Prizren when they visit Kosovo and it is quite well known for Dokufest and other festivals. I'm really glad I also spent time in Prishtina. Understanding a country and its complexities usually means exposing oneself to all the different angles. So grateful I understood this early on in the journey because I think it is why I'm learning so much on the Footsteps To Inspire journey. ‚†Ä

Nope. .
Noone.
.
Not even Batman.
.
It's a hard reality but 
NOONE IS COMING TO SAVE YOU!
.
What does that mean?
.
It means that no human being is going to lift you up off your feet and carry you to your desired destination. .
Even Batman (my favorite super hero, by virtue that he is a regular dude) cant pick you up. Noone can. Noone will.
.
However, there are people who can help GUIDE you in the direction of the end result you look to accomplish but this can ONLY happen if you are already moving in that direction. .
Noone can carry you where you wanna go. Which is why we when people talk about the idea of finding their "purpose" it drives me CRAZY.
.
You cant find your purpose until you start walking. When you start walking, you find missions. When you find your mission, you realize a greater sense of purpose in completing the mission. Completion of the mission lends itself to greater results and rewards in life. Finding greater results and rewards in life empowers us with purpose. .
The reason we want people to carry us or "SAVE US" is because we dont want to walk through any of the stuff that "life stuff" and we just want to reach the ultimate ending. It's like we wanna get to "the end" without reading the book. .
Heres your action plan:
.
First, acknowledge that you must walk through the fire.
.
Next you must take one powerful step (a powerful change)
.
Only after you take one powerful step, then you must ask for help and collaboration.
.
Then after you seek help...you keep walking and allow the help to "guide" not "carry"
.
Then you confront your demons.
.
Then you fall, and rely on the help to add clarity.
.
Then you keep walking in pursuit of the completion of your mission.
.
Then you complete your mission.
.
Then you find your purpose
.
In that order. .
But dont look for someone to carry you.
First...
.
Get on track with completing your mission.

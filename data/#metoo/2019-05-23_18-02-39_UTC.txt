A trigger can be a word, a person, a date, a smell, a touch even an event. The body remembers even when you don't and it can trigger the connection from the body and memory. Trauma is an experience that you go through, it is not an event. It's like living in a time machine desperately searching for a way to move forward rather than backwards with the memories.
I can remember before I remembered  my secret I was at the mall and everything was fine but I had a complete meltdown in fear. All because somebody walked past me wearing old spice the cologne of my abuser. I froze up in a panic felt like I couldn't breathe. I had no idea WHY. I do now.,üëç‚òÄÔ∏è
Some of my triggers include cameras, video cameras, old spice, slaps to the face even on TV, darkness when I cannot see, and when I could smell alcohol. Once I was able to identify that these were triggers it was much easier for me to handle and no longer needing to freeze and  panic

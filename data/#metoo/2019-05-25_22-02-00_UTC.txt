What gets us into trouble sometimes is our own mind. Think about it! How many times have you reacted without a game plan, not taking time to really think through how you want your story to be written? You’re going to hit a lot of bumps on the way to success and if you can step back for a minute and really think about what you want to do when life turns on you a bit, you’re going to be unstoppable. The hits won’t knock you down. They may bruise you for a bit, but you just keep going!

"I was adopted when I was 11 and my foster father stated he didnt look at me as a girl...he looked at me as a woman in his house. He at first tried to do little touches I guess to feel me out, I didn't like it so his response was oh I'm just playing. Then he used to just go on trips but didnt want to take the other siblings just me. Thats when the touches turned into him just throwing himself at me. I asked why me he stated the other siblings talked to much and even though I could tell the foster mom. ...she would take his word over mines and I would just end up back in the system. Till this day I can never tell anybody who took my virginity. And I'm 31 years old." - J. .

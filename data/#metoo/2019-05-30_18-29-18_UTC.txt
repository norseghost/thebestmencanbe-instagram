I thinks it’s about time that I introduce myself.
•
My name is Christina Brooke-Lynn. I am a survivor, a pug mama and a good vibes spreading kinda gal.
•
People tell me, “oh, I see you’re into fitness too!” Yes. And no. I’m into growth. Into losing myself, finding myself, and rediscovering myself. Over and over and over.
•
When I was in middle school, I was molested by a kid older than me. When I was 15, two months before my sweet 16, my family’s home burnt to the ground and we lost every material possession we had. I left a domestic abuse situation, I survived a pretty rough car accident and I am alive when someone assaulted me then made the decision for me that my life was no longer worth living. I have struggled with food, alcohol, self love, self worth and even life itself.
•
Am I into fitness? That’s a strong “yes.” But I’m also into holistic health and healing, I’m into spreading awareness, I’m into mental health and I’m into positivity. I’m into supporting women, I’m into lifting heaving things and I’m into living my very best life. Every. Single. Day. I am healthy. I am happy. I’m just glad to be here.
•
I didn’t start an Instagram account for followers. I started Instagram for a community. A community of warriors. A community of people who lift each other up, who understand that we are each on our own unique journey, and who want to support one another with love and kindness.
•
I want a community of people who have been through some shit. People who have gone down some dark roads but managed to survive and tell their story. I’m here to tell my story. Through pictures, through writing and through gym routines. Most selfishly, I’m here for me. I’m here to track my journey and my progress. I’m really hoping to meet some badass babes along the way.
• 
I’m not overly creative. You most likely won’t see anything fancy here. What you will see? Me. The good days. The bad days. And the everything in between days. Here you’ll most likely see some gardening, some KiKi the pug, some workouts and a whole lot of me.
•
Let’s be friends. Let’s chat. Let’s support one another. Life is about so much more than just surviving.

Thank you @ceecee__88 for sending me this picture while I’m in Croatia! What an honour to be featured on the same wall as @grovecampus 🙏! I can’t believe that being completely naked & utterly vulnerable about my journey has given me so many incredible opportunities. It’s beautiful to be at a place where I can honestly say that all of the struggles had a purpose. It was all in divine order, to bring me to right here. I’m finally in a position where I can share my truth with others, with hopes of helping perhaps just one other human, who might be feeling alone with their own battles. I am beyond words. My heart is so full! Thank you @lululemonmtl @lululemon for seeing us fully and for featuring us to celebrate #internationalyogaday ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨Check out @lululemonmtl’s stories over the next week leading up to June 21st!

Jacob Anderson, 23, was charged with sexually assaulting a 19-year-old in 2016. Four counts of sexual assault were dismissed in exchange for a charge of unlawful restraint. The victim and her supporters have denounced this plea bargain that will mean no jail time or requirement to register as a sex offender. I strongly suggest that those of us who stand for change read the victim impact statement in this case and write to Judge Ralph Strother expressing our disappointment in the representation of justice in sexual assault cases. Demand change.

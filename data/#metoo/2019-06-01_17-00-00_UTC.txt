they say that guns don’t kill people, people kill people. but people kill people with guns. and i’m tired of the “good guys with guns stop bad guys with guns” where are the good guys with guns when there are school shootings? where are the good guys with guns when a mosque is shot up? where are the good guys with guns when someone shoots up a synagogue? and why do some “good guys” with guns shoot people of color without a reason. if you’re afraid of gun control it’s because you’re a criminal. gun control/ background checks will not hurt truly good people because if you aren’t a criminal then here will be no problem with your background check.  good guys with guns do not stop bad guys with guns. it’s like fighting fire with fire, it only makes the problem worse. #nomore #guncontrol #gunreform  #activism #feminist #feminism #genderequality #metoo #believesurvivors #youngactivist #teenactivist #makeadifference #genz #intersectionalfeminism #bodypositive #bethechange #bethegood #imoverit #lgbtq #youngfeminist #makingadifference #loveislove #fightlikeagirl #notmypresident  #explore #love #foryou #follow #like #impeach45

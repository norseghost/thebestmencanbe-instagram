This is a post by ‘chinon’, saying: “I wish issues with daily hygiene due to mental illness were talked about more. I feel like it’s the alphabet in the room when it comes to sypmtoms of debilitating disorders. So I’m proud of everyone who brushed their teeth, washed their face, showered and/or put on fresh underwear today. And it’s okay if You haven’t done any of those (I know I’ve only done the first two); I’m still so proud of you for managing and surviving another day. Keep going You’re doin good.”

Announcing the Kung Fu Nuns' next Self-Defense Workshop for women! Organized by Live to Love India, this hands-on workshop will take place at Hemis, Ladakh in the Northern Indian #Himalayas. During this unique week-long program, the Kung Fu Nuns will teach participants physical self-defense, conditioning skills to stay strong, and lead group discussions on the realities of sexual abuse. This is a rare and wonderful opportunity for women of all ages to come together and support each other in growth and self-protection. 
The Kung Fu Nuns' Self-Defense Workshop is part of the Summer Youth Programs, which also include heritage preservation and community empowerment activities. See flyer for details and registration.  See you there!

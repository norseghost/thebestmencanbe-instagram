Ladies: how do you say no?
.
We talk a lot identifying consent, but less about how to say no when you don’t consent. I don’t mean just about sex; I mean saying no to anything, whether it’s upgrading to the deluxe package car wash or volunteering at that charity drive or being teased in a way that you don’t feel comfortable with
.
This is an actual question (all of my questions are actual questions) because I’m realizing that with all of my life experiences, I still have no idea how to say no
.
Today a male friend told me I looked nice and squeezed my arm. Whatever, he’s a touchy-feely guy and I like him a lot. But he never half-hugged me when I showed up in sweats. Then he slapped a mosquito off of my leg for me and for some reason, that crossed a boundary with me that I did. not. want.
.
Normally I’m all about hugs and touching, but I’ve been through some trauma recently that has left me jittery and very much NOT wanting to be touched by men unless I am reaaally comfortable with them and I initiate it. But I didn’t know how to react. I just froze and and pretended it didn’t happen. Later I thought of a joke I could have made to politely say no, but it happened so fast that I didn’t think of it at the time
.
Honestly I almost felt like crying afterwards — not because my friend is in anyway a bad person, but because I feel like I don’t have control over my own body. I have dressed down my entire life to avoid this kind of attention, but I want to be able to express myself while maintaining control of my body

Suggestions? Basically every girl I know has been through some similar situation and I want to know how you handle these things 🙏🏽with strangers, good friends, acquaintances, or family

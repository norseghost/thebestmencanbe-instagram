Recently I came across the profile of @echosummerhill who has been digging into healing past trauma for the past year and a half. It lit a spark in me to dig more into mine and heal so many scars and wounds. .
Despite the fact that I have come a very long way with healing old wounds - I still have a very long way to go.

There are something's that are best healed when you confront them on your own time and doing. Some times you just need to reflect and be honest with yourself.
.
Therapy has been amazing for me also. Allows me to take a deep look into my pain and allows me to have lightbulbs moments like I had yesterday. It's amazing when you can connect dots and be like "oh okay that makes sense and this is what I have to change"
.
Journaling these past two weeks has been very enlightening and I'm ecstatic to see where it will take my healing.

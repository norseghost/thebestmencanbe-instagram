Manifesting 101. Children not instilled with good energy from the start, or those who have undergone traumatic experiences will have a more difficult time manifesting. This is because everything in the universe has a source, except an empty human being. You have to become the energy of the thing you desire in order to receive it. If you've mostly received negative input from others and haven't felt pure emotions like unconditional love, peace, joy, prosperity, safety, attachment, protection, how will you know which vibration to become? All you know is the reversed energy or a void. It becomes like a guessing game and you end up frustrated with yourself that you still can't match the correct vibration for a sustained period. Give yourself credit. You are trying every day to get better at this energy game. The wounds are there to prevent you from being able to manifest fully. And your ability to ascend is in direct proportion to how wounded you have become here. This is one misconception about the law of attraction : you can't fake it. In order to match higher vibrations, you have to heal the gaping low vibe wounds (aka Chakra imbalances). That's not something a class can teach you. It requires your own undying personal effort.

It\u2019s a formula: here\u2019s your info on risks, benefits, and alternatives; thank you, here\u2019s my choice.\n.\nBut this narrow view of informed consent as a simple information exchange misses a whole lot: most of all, the power dynamics that are built into the setting where it occurs. As it turns out, power is a major part of the discussion around consent in general.\n.\nIt\u2019s hard to talk about informed consent in birth when our cultural understanding of \u201cconsent\u201d in general is so skewed. Our national definition of consent is still very broad; everyone agrees that \u201cyes\u201d is consent, but many people also believe (and law, unfortunately, sometimes supports) that consent can also mean the absence of no, a capitulation to pressure, or a moment in time where we said yes and then felt obligated to stick with that yes even when circumstances or our minds changed. ...\n.\nNew article at birthmonopoly.com/consent !!!\n.\n#consentculture #consent #informedconsent #birthrights #metoo #laboranddelivery #birthmonopoly #mothermayithemovie #laboranddelivery #hospitalbirth #birthrightsarehumanrights #feministbirth"

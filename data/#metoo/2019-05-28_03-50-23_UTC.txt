Keto-Raw Fusion 50% minimum (up to a 100%) SuperFood FAT, 25% Superfood PROTIEN, 25% non fast-converting/non-starchy superfood CARBS like raw medicinal high antioxidant vegetables that are colors of the rainbow! So just knock out the protein and the carbs if you feel like all fat during that particular meal. 
Thats if you don't feel like any carbs or protein in that moment of the day, at that meal. Your body is going to tell you. Or your mind's going to  attract addictive substances. And so goes the dance of this whole eating thing LOL. As a people(s) we are so addicted to carbs that we think we might be missing something if we eat all fat at a meal or snack. There are plenty of times where I'll just settle into a whole avocado with some pecans on the side and drizxle olive oil over it (add a little salt and pepper and squeeze Meyer lemon). xo

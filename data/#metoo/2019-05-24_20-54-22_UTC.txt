Any day above ground is definitely a great day. Life is hard. Sometimes trying to remain optimistic and in positive vibrations can be difficult when things start to fall apart. The bad times will come and they will also come to pass. Easier said than done, but remember that any day above ground is definitely a great day! Just keep going.

Since placing the ##blackmadonnaja it is men who take care of her.  It is the men who have punched through the concrete slab in Manor Park, Kingston placed soil and planted flowers and created a garden around her.  There she is shaded by a healing noni tree, a tree the men planted, the spirit of the tree is believed to have powers to heal emotionally while itâ€™s fruit & roots heal one  physically. 
In the parish of St Thomas a garden has been planted for her, melon and pumpkin were some of the plants that are now growing in her garden.  In that parish she overlooks the sea.

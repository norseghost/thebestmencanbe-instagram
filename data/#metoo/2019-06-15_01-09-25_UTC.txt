Dear friends, 
If I had the proper warnings of benzodiazepines written right there on the label, there is a high chance that I would not have had a grand mal seizure from missing a dose of Valium, would not have stopped breathing and died in respiratory depression from combined/concomitant use with an opioid (prescribed in combination with each other after endometriosis surgery), would not be still suffering in benzo withdrawal 189 days after stopping Valium, and would not have a neurological brain injury due to the doctors keeping me on the medication for over 10 years. If there is a Black Label Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è, (the highest level of warning that the FDA can give to a drug), written 1st thing on each FDA benzodiazepine fact sheet about the Warning of combined use of Opioids and Benzos, then they should also BE PRINTED ON THE RX BOTTLES. NO EXEPTIONS! This drug needs to have more warnings and Precautions. PERIOD. There are too many people suffering. Too many people that have been lost. As well as a HUGE percentage of Opioid Overdoses occurring because of the Benzodiazepines ALSO being present in their systems. Please help to raise awareness of the dangers of these drugs. Benzodiazepines are currently an unspoken Epidemic that is happening to millions of human beings right before our eyes. Please, Let‚Äôs put an end to this poison. üñ§

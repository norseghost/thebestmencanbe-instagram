Today, Dr. Paula Johnson, President of @wellesleycollege and co-chair of our Sexual Harassment of Women in Academia report, testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. The testimony was on H.R. 36, the Combatting Sexual Harassment in Science Act. The bipartisan bill addresses sexual harassment in #STEM fields by supporting sexual harassment research efforts to prevent and respond to sexual harassment and by establishing an interagency working group to coordinate the federal science agenciesâ€™ efforts to reduce the prevalence of sexual harassment involving grant personnel.

The purpose of the hearing was to assess federal science agency policies and procedures for addressing sexual harassment involving federally-funded researchers. The Committee also explored lessons learned, enduring challenges, and future opportunities for preventing and mitigating the negative impact of sexual harassment in STEM.  #theNASEM #science #engineering #medicine #ScienceToo #MeTooSTEM #MeToo #sexualharassment

Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away... well not really. After a long discussion with a colleague about feminism, I thought I got through to him and had explained thoroughly why sentences like „it has Never happened to me, not in my presence...“ are neither helpfull nor true. But I had to end the conversation, when he told me about his mom being frequently grabbed and touched sexually riding the subway when she was young and how that did not affect her at all!! I was so mad, I stood up and very calmly said, „I have to leave I am getting very mad and will not be able to talk to you about this any longer right now.“ Please help me, what would you say in a moment like that?? #aaaaa #fuckno #changeofperspective #feminism #feminismus #metoo #metoomovement #redenistgoldschweigenistüberbewertet #speakup #no #muddi #workingmom #listen #educateyourself #nosilence #nomore #fucksilence

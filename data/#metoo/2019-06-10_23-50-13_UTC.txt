This is cheesy but weirdly spot on. These characters from @amcthewalkingdead tell a tale. One is horrific, fully committed to himself and his place in the patriarchy. He's cruel, self-absorbed, racist, a womanizer, uses fear to manipulate and frankly, icky. (no offense to @michael_rooker) The other is kind, sometimes difficult but always trying, loyal and deeply good, even when it costs him. Daryl isn't necessarily the most popular character because @bigbaldhead is pretty. He's the most popular character because he's what vulnerable, strong, kick ass men with a heart look like in our best dreams. (Aside from the whole eating possum thing) There's a reason we love #daryldixon and this is part of it. #winetalking #stilltrue #welovedaryl #downwiththepatriarchyðŸ˜ˆ #metoo

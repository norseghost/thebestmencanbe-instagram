When I was thirteen I was assaulted by someone close to me. I loved in a painful silence for a very long time and truth is I’m still very much so living in it. People always say that you should never speak to strangers and to never get in a car with someone you don’t know. No one ever tells you the bad guy can be the one you sleep next to at night. No one tells you, your worst nightmare could be the person you are in love with. I wish more people would tell the truth. #explore #explorepage #metoo #secret #anonymous #truth #nomoresilence

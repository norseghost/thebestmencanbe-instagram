Martin Luther king, Ghandi & Rosa Parks ordinary people who all encountered immense obstacles. 
As Rosa Parks put it “I’ve learnt over the years that when one’s mind is made up, this diminishes fear, knowing what must be done does away with fear” 
Your soul on fire means -
-It is about being brave when things are hard, -It is about letting go of control and leaning into faith
-It is using the voice to drown out the hate
-It is to never stop believing people can be good

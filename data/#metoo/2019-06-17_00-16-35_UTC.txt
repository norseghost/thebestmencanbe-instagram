Around schools in our community or in public whether its with your mates or with Family people have been using the N word a lot. This is not right at all. The reason you cannot say the N word is because there is a power imbalance in society, since ‘White’ people have more power, theres always a racial connotation to the word when other races say it. Regardless of your ethnicity you cannot say the N word, only black people or mixed can saybit because it can bever have racist connotation when used towards black people by black people because theyre on the same level in society. No matter if its in a music or someone gave you ‘the n word pass’ You have no right to say it because you are not from that community. LETS JUST NOT SAY IT. #Whatsthestory

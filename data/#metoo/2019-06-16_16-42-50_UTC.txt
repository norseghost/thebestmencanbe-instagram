It starts with us. WE are the ones who can uplift, encourage, & support other women. We are so used to “society” telling women they are supposed to look one way and act another, BUT WE ARE SOCIETY! We have the power to change the way women are seen and supported! 🙌🏻👏🏻⠀
-⠀
So let’s take that supportive and friendly womanly energy we give other women drunk in the bathroom, and spread it all over! 🥰⠀
-⠀
Compliment a girls shoes, tell her she has beautiful hair, support other women’s hustles, etc! If you want to tell someone something, that’s even the slightest positive... TELL THEM! It’s that easy! 🤗💕⠀

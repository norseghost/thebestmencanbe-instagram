The attacker this time was a friend I had known for four years. And he was gay.\n\nWhat struck me in the aftermath was how ill-equipped the college students were to report the assault. This time, there were witnesses. There was widespread concern on campus. Yet no one knew what to do.\n\nAnd I was still alone. I felt the old familiar split down the middle, like a tree cut by lightning. There was the me I remembered being\u2014waving my hand from a cab window where I was jammed into the backseat with three other young men. I remembered playing pool and beer pong with my brother's classmates, strolling through Manhattan with them. \nBut now there was this other person. Terrified of being seen, I cowered in my brother's dorm room behind a locked door. For it felt as if the assault was a consequence of being seen. Existing as a non-normative gendered body in a space shared by other bodies, particularly male bodies, felt unbearably vulnerable, an invitation to be assaulted again. \nAfter I was strangled, I wanted nothing more than to disappear. My silence, I believed, was my protection.\n#metoo #toxicmasculinity #misogyny My story at mceaston.com"

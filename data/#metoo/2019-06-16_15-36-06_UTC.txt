Meet Red Bolt who built the house I was raised in & won’t see this, he only uses the internet for Wikipedia & to see how the goat market is doing on Craigslist. My Dad is a professional cowboy, carpenter & so much more than that. He wanted boys, got 3 girls & taught us all how to work hard & always maintain our integrity. I’ve never met someone so respected by his peers & it’s not from what he says but what he does and says. He’s also invincible in a fun cowboy way! 🤠I’ve seen my Dad literally walk off a broken back in two places, get bucked off by a horse he’s training then get right back on. We were once splitting wood & his thumb sliced open to the bone but we still finished the rest of the cord before he went in the house, washed it with soap & the dish brush then refused to go to the hospital. Born in Oklahoma, the youngest of five Bolt Boys, I’m so proud to call this man my Dad. In the photos you’ll see the pizza oven he recently built for Mom & the donkey he road around the streets of Bakersfield as a kid, pulling a cart instead of the impractical bicycle. “You can’t haul anything with a bike.” Both my parents, my sisters and I share our middle name, Lee. My father is a proud Native American of the Choctaw Tribe, we even have the “Indian #” his Mother was issued by the gov. He raised us with tribe knowledge, to respect nature, hunt & only shoot when we had a kill shot & we were going to use the whole animal, etc. In HS I was being bullied for being good at sports, he said: “You don’t have to say anything, just go out there and be better than them.” 🙌🏽💜 “I love you” is something my family is getting better at expressing verbally. As my Dad softens from the love he has for his grandchildren he’s even hugging me more & says the words, too! 🤯As a kid I knew he loved me when he’d help me saddle my horse, or show up to my softball game, or build my entire 5th grade cabin project out of a tree he chopped down & carved out his own hand crafted Lincoln Logs (I got an A). He’s a man who expresses his love through his actions & dedication to the family & our ranch. Retired at 71 he still wakes with the 🌞as there is always work to be done. Love you, Daddio.

                        "text": "Yesterday I was pushing a cart across the parking lot of the grocery store wearing jeans and a t-shirt, no make up, and had both of my little boys in tow. A car with two grown men stopped in front of the store doors so I had to pass them to walk in. They whistled and hollered at me through their open windows. I gripped Truman\u2019s hand and walked quicker. \nOne man yelled out the window, \u201cDamn, look at that body!\u201d Truman turned around and waved to them as they sped off chuckling to themselves. \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d Tru said. \u201cWhy do they want to look at your body?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t want him to remember the incident so I tried to brush it off and said, \u201cOh boys just say silly things sometimes.\u201d\nBut then anger flared inside of me and I realized that\u2019s not the right answer. And that\u2019s not the right example for my son. If women have to be constantly objectified, even at the grocery store with two small kids, something has to start changing. \nI squatted down in the middle of the store entrance to look at Tru in the eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me feel good when men yell at me. It makes me feel embarrassed and sometimes scared. My body is MINE and it\u2019s for no one else but me. We should never yell to girls about their bodies or tease them about it. We never want to make someone feel embarrassed or scared, right? I want you to be kind and respectful to girls and not be like those guys. Your job is to make girls feel loved and safe.\u201d\n\u201cGot it!\u201d Tru yelled and squeezed his little fist in his attempt at making a muscle. He ran ahead and I don\u2019t know if he retained anything I said, but I felt much better. \nI\u2019m sick of ignoring it. I\u2019m sick of saying \u201cOh, that\u2019s just men being silly.\u201d No more. I think this generation is starting to teach our boys at a young age that this behavior is not okay and won\u2019t be ignored.\nSo here is to raising our boys to compliment instead of cat-call, and to sympathize rather than sexualize. I\u2019m ready for a generation of protectors to start emerging. \n#justletmeshop \n#bethechange #berespectful \n#metoo #metoomovement \n#stopobjectifyingwomen #parkinglotlessons #raisingboys"

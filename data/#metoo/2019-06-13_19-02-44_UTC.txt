Working on sculpting a Dream Guardian named Tin-Bot-2. The idea is that these characters absorb lost dreams and return them to their first owner. With my illness I come up with new dreams and lose them just as quickly. So, I wanted to create stories where your dreams chase you instead of the other way around.  #dissociativeidentitydisorder #multiplepersonalities #mentalhealthawareness #mentalillness #depressionkills #majordepressivedisorder #anxiety #metoo #ptsd #traumarecovery

#Grooming is a tactic that impedes our ability to detect abuse that is impending or already occurring.⁣ ⁣
“Grooming is the predatory act of maneuvering another individual into a position that makes them more isolated, dependent, and likely to trust. It is a tactic of overcoming the survivor's defenses by slowly desensitizing their natural reaction to abusive behaviors. Grooming works by mixing positive behaviors with elements of abuse. At the beginning, all behaviors are positive. Slowly, abusive elements are added in amounts that surprise the survivor to an extent, but do not push alarm to a high level. Overtime, the inappropriate comes to feel normal.⁣⁣
⁣
A predator will identify and engage a victim and work to gain the target’s trust, break down defenses, and manipulate the victim until they get whatever it is they are after. Overt attention, flattery/ego stroking,  physical isolation, charm, gift-giving, gas-lighting, secrecy, and threats are all hallmarks of grooming.⁣⁣
⁣
Because the primary aggressor's real goal isn't understood by the survivor, they often miss the harmful implication and dismiss the internal signals of alarm that do arise. Often, the first violations are boundary issues but not physical violations.  Eventually, the primary aggressor's intentions become clear, but by that time, there is considerable ensnarement. ⁣⁣
⁣
Grooming is practiced by narcissists, antisocial predators, con-artists and sexual aggressors, who target and manipulate vulnerable people for exploitation. There is no prototypical victim. Almost anyone can be vulnerable to grooming.⁣⁣
⁣
Groomers usually possess a lot of charm and personality. Many people cannot bring themselves to believe ”such a nice person” could do such a thing. Most offenders also possess power – be it political, monetary or absolute power in the case of a husband or parent. ⁣⁣

6 main stages of grooming:⁣⁣
• Targeting the victim • Gaining the victims trust • Filling a need • Isolating the victim • Sexualizing the relationship • Maintaining control”⁣⁣

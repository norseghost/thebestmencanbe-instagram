Normally I don’t like to include politics in my artwork however I feel there is so much going on within the country that I can’t be silent. I decided to make this piece to reflect some of the problems the country and the world are currently facing. #art #sequentialart #artistsoninstagram #abortionrights #climatechange #metoo #guncontrol #gayrights #pridemonth #scadart

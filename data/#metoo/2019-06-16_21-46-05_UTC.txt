I believe we have found a venue! Things are still being ironed out, but it looks like we might have a new home! This is the historic Minshall House, one of the oldest buildings in Media. Itâ€™s a warm space with welcoming yellow walls and a gorgeous garden. We are still talking about details to see if we can host the June workshop here, so look out for a future announcement! So excited!

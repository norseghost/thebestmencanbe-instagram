I am not easily moved to tears but this story really hit me hard. An innocent man is dead now after a 16 year old girl falsely accused him of sexually assaulting her on a bus on April 23rd, 2019 in Logan, Utah despite camera footage showing otherwise. Her brother, in a fit of rage, attacked this man so brutally that he later died of a swollen brain after hitting his head on the pavement. This man was Michael Fife, a homeless man that was once a US soldier. A man who people said would give anyone the shirt off his back despite having nothing. He was 62. The #meetoo movement has officially gone too far. Careers have been decimated, lives have been destroyed, but now men who have done nothing wrong are literally dying as a result of being falsely accused. To the people who make these false claims, do you not see how dire the consequences of your actions can be? Do you not see how they spit in the face of everyone who has actually been sexually assaulted? I don't like to bring people down and Instagram should be a happy place, but something this important and overlooked needs to be discussed because it seems like nobody is talking about it. It is unknown if the girl and her brother will be tried as they are both teens. The link for Michael's GoFundMe page is gf.me/u/thtv28. He leaves behind his son.

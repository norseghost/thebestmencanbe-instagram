That woman came out in 2017 and said she lied and let him be lynched just because he was black.\n\nSo rightly so the other kids in the class were outraged but then the class took a slight turn with the boys in class saying that whistling and cat calling girls and women isn\u2019t a big deal and we should take it as a compliment to which the girls said they get yelled and honked at all the time from men in cars and that they didn\u2019t think it was a bad thing. \nThis prompted the teacher to ask if ANYONE found it inappropriate to catcall, whistle or honk at girls in the street to raise their hand.... TIGAH ROSE WAS THE ONLY ONE!! The boys then mocked her and asked why is that a bad thing, we are just giving you compliments and the girls agreed.\n\nWhat in the fuckary are we teaching our kids?! How is it that in 2019 our year 10 boys and girls think this is ok to do to young girls whether they know them or not or whether it is from the car or walking past them in the street?! Tigah Rosie was clearly upset that she was the only one that called this vile behaviour out and that\u2019s when Aiva piped up and said that only yesterday she had a man look up from his phone and stare at her as she was walking past, she put her head down, sped up and walked into the school gates as fast as she could. \nContinued in the comments!"

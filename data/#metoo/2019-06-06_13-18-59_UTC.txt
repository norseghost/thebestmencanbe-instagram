⚡️Summer Shred⚡️, Sneak Peek Edition! .
I'm only doing this once this summer! 
So if you've been watching me wondering what the heck I'm doing in my transformation posts....THIS is your opportunity to see and experience for yourself...FOR FREE. Ya better jump on this! 
Because the most effective way to do something is to DO IT, I've decided to give you an EXCLUSIVE look at the workouts I do. 
What it is: 14 Days of one of my favorite programs available on BOD. 
To get the best experience possible, I'm asking you to commit to these 14 Days with no excuses, completing every workout. 
After its over, if you've completed every single workout I'll be available for a 15min 1:1 call with you to talk though your experience, how it felt and what your goals are moving forward. 
This is ONLY happening once this summer, so get ready to work and have fun together doing these home workouts together! 
Steps to join:
- DM me your email - I'll send you a link to sign up
- Once you sign up, email me a screen shot of your receipt
- Then you'll be added to our private group on FB + we will kick it off on 6/10 
Don’t sleep on this, it’s only happening once this summer!☀️

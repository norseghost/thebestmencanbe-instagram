The best #tbt Eva eva!!! My momma been in this game a looooooonnnnngggg time and here is evidence of her on screen in #uptownsaturdaynight .... I wonder what it was like to be in LA in the 70s on a set with black Hollywood royalty!  I just canâ€™t even imagine... this moment also defined her life in a real way.... so thankful for the connections and the opportunity to learn and grow and tell really good stories ... the one Iâ€™m writing about her is bright and full of love, forgiveness and self reflection ... she so cute ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°#readilyavailablematerial #momsanddaughters #blackhollywood #metoo #gentlereminders #lions #writer #script #biggiesmalls

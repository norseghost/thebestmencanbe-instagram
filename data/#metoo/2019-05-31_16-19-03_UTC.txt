Such news in India is so rare that Iâ€™m actually feeling stumped,at a loss for words & overwhelmed.
That one of the biggest & most respected film studio & family in #Bollywood finally takes a stand at the right side of history is a sign on the wall for #India MeToo. 
This has been a tough 8 months for the ones fighting for this change & most of us are in therapy, hurt & depressed in different ways seeing all the accused in multiple cases rehabilitated, back on the saddle, unmoved, unapologetic. 
Yesterday the news was that this serial pervert who is an open secret of the industry having molested minors & all ages of women, many of whom finally spoke up during #MeToo finally overcoming the shame, might be back on #IndianIdol this season on @sonytvofficial 
This morning I received news that Kailash Kher, another person who had victimised even minors, was performing at the Gateway of India for the Sarang Utsav by @mtdc_official on June1 with nothing less than the CM in attendance. Took the wind out of my sails. Thinking no one cares? 
I was wrong. Karma will catch up. We will make sure it does. Wake up everyday & fight the good fight. 
Change is coming, make no mistake. 
We are the change. 
I am the change. 
Thank you  to everybody who understands why this is the most important fight. For dignity, safety, fairness & equal opportunity. ðŸ”´

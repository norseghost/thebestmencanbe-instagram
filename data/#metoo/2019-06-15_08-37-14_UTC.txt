Violence is never linear, homogenised or as banal as it appears. On May 30, agencies carried a news report about a woman in Lakhimpur district, Assam, who killed her husband and appeared at the local police station with his severed head. Guneswari Barkataky not only killed her husband but also surrendered herself for the crime she had committed.

What does this tell us about the femininity of violence? Or the complications and troubles associated with the victim, who not only committed the crime but also chose to face accountability for her actions?

And where does the debate on martial and domestic violence feature in this particular incident, where the stakes of women are high in a brahamanical-patriarchal, misogynist and heteronormative state?

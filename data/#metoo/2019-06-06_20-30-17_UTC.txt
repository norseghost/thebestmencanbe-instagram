Don't miss the latest episode of Intersectionality Matters, "The Anatomy of an Apology", featuring @eveensler and philosopher Kate Manne
.
"NEW EPISODE! A year and a half after allegations against Harvey Weinstein propelled #MeToo into the national spotlight, how should we be thinking about culpability, accountability, and reckoning with harm? When an apology is given, what concrete actions must be taken to move the conversation from recognition to remedy? And what does intersectionality have to do with it?" - @intersectionalitymatters, hosted by #VDay Board Member & @aapolicyforum Co-Founder & Executive Director @kimberlecrenshaw

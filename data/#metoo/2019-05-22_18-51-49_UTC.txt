New research reveals 60% of managers who are men say they are uncomfortable participating in common job-related activities with women, such as mentoring, working alone together, or socializing together. A year ago, that number was 46%. And senior men are now more hesitant to work with junior women than junior men across a range of activities. One-on-one meetings: senior men are 12 times more likely to hesitate to meet with a woman than a man. Business travel: nine times more likely to hesitate. Work dinners: six times more likely.

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandburg wrote in Fortune: “It’s time for men to rethink what it means to be a good boss—or even just a good guy. We’ve had many conversations since #MeToo with men eager to say, for the record, they never did anything inappropriate at work and never would. That’s great. But not harassing women isn’t enough. More deliberate action is needed to support women and make the workplace better for everyone. That means taking a hard look at whose work we celebrate and whose talent we invest in. It means making sure our hiring and review processes are as free from bias as possible. It means going the extra mile to mentor and sponsor people—like women—who are often outnumbered and underestimated. Our careers have been possible because people along the way believed in us and made sure others knew it. They gave us challenges that let us stretch and prove ourselves and offered generous advice about how to succeed."

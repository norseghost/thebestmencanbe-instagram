Now, on our own terms, calling out Cat! ;) @s.pacequeen

Cat Masangkay was born and raised by two Filipinx immigrants in Queens, New York City. Growing up, Cat felt conflicted by the cultural disconnect between her and her parents; she just wanted to assimilate into American society. When she went away for college, Cat realized how integral her Filipinx heritage was to her identity and how she was ashamed of it for so long. Cat came back to NYC to realign with her purpose and to reconnect with her heritage. She is now immersing herself in Filipinx communities and culture as well as learning Tagalog.

There is a darkness in her eyes, there is sadness that is palpable. Yet there is eternal hope. This juxtaposition provided much confusion, and angst.  The photo is very hard to share. There has been so many difficult and unfair events that have dulled her hopes... yet her soul was always on fire. No one saw or cared that there was a death of her youth... as she was merely a pawn in a chaotic, dysfunctional story, with everyone simply trying to survive! And she finally thrived!  #thrive  #survive #dysfunctional  #soulonfire #pain #metoo

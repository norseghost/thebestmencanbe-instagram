There was a moment tonight where I longed for my garden. I wanted its quiet. I wanted its color. I wanted its beauty. I wanted its reminder of my importance in its world. I water it, prune it, treat it for pests and other diseases. It makes me feel strong in a place filled many delicate things, and sometimes we just need to feel the strength our garden gives us.

I wanted to be there more than anything else. Just for a minute or two. Enough to gather my peace, find my strength, and be filled with beauty again. All because sometimes people make jokes about things they do not understand; things that are deeply painful and carry life-long scars. Just because you don’t understand it or it didn’t happen to you, doesn’t give you license to make a joke. Some things are just not funny. They never have been and they never will be. You never know someone’s story or pain, so take a beat, think it through, and change course; because those jokes only make you look bad. #metoo #mentalhealth #backyardgarden #gardentherapy #naturetherapy #dirttherapy #sexualassaultisneverok

For those underpriviliged young children and youth who live on the margins of the larger society in Nigeria, having the opportunity to be creative and enjoy being with others to express themselves artistically is a dream come true.  One social enterprise is making this dream a reality - the Children’s Art Workshop in Lagos is the brainchild of social entrepreneur, Sia Alexander and is making a real difference to the lives of young people in underpriviliged communities. 
The Children’s Art Workshop provides free art-based workshops and fieldtrips to local Lagosian youth from impoverished communities.  It utilises the site of the Nimbus Art Gallery as a community gathering center for children in the local area to come and eat, play, dance, create, make music, design, write, perform, etc.

Beautiful beings! Starting next Wednesday June 12th Iâ€™ll be leading a yoga class on the patio of Homegrown Bistro!  The photo lists the dates of the classes.  After each session, we will have a light salad fare provided by Homegrown! All proceeds for the event will go to It Happened to Alex, a local nonprofit specializing in providing empowerment and services for those affected by sexual abuse. This has been 2 years in the making and super excited to share with you all this summer! #empowerment #charityseries #karmayoga #soar #thelimitlessflight #bereceptive #dharmamademedoit #metoo #yogaonthepatio #wellnesswednesdays

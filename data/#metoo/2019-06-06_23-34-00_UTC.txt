Even though we’re in the midst of campaigning we are not forgetting our theme this quarter which is SEX AND CONSENT. Friends, no means no. Not maybe. Not possibly. Not sort of. Not wait a minute. Remember that you have a voice and you have permission to walk away. Stand tall. Ask for help if you need it. We are here for you and have professionals that can support you so DM is if you’re stuck. Pinky promise ❗️

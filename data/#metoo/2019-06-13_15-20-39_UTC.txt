Today is here, and we are so excited! 🍽☕️ A portion of your check from 17 participating establishments will be donated to Family Safety Network. With these funds we work against domestic and sexual violence, advocate for victims, provide emergency shelter and safe transitional housing. With these donations we are able to provide resources to victims in our valley. #tetonvalleytoo

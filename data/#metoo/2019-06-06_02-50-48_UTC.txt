Common is so transparent and raw in his new book. It is powerful to hear a black man, from Chicago, speak about his pain, his passion and his determination to exemplify love with such vulnerability. He also discloses his own experience of sexual abuse. Men can make a real difference when they take ownership of their trauma along with responsibility for healing it! Thank you @common ! We need men to heal .... really heal .. in order to help stop the cycle of abuse/rape/misogyny etc. Consider gifting this book to the men in your life for Fatherâ€™s Day! #letlovehavethelastword #chicago #blackmen #blackwomenmatter #healing #believesurvivors #common #love #muterkelly #transformtrauma #timesup #metoo #tellsomebody

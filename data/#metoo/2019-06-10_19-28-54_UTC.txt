UNSPOKEN Audiences were treated to the film #UNSPOKEN, directed by #Jamaican born, #New York based director @dir.danae at the 8th annual #garifunafilmfestival, which kicked off over the #memorialdayweekend in #Venice, #California.

#moviesynopsis In the 12-minute short, UNSPOKEN, director #DaneGrandison brings the conversation of #MeToo to the backyard of her hometown – that is, Kingston, Jamaica. Based on the novel, The Bed Head, by Jennifer Grahame, UNSPOKEN explores the lives of characters – that is, Caroline and Icy -- who are bound and burdened by duty. One is a married woman, and part of Jamaica’s affluent society while the other woman is the hired live-in help, expected to oblige her employers’ personal requests. The undertones in the story are about two women connected by living untold truths and heartbreak. Shot in Kingston, Jamaica, UNSPOKEN explores the unsaid truths of power, class, and money within a society at large. .

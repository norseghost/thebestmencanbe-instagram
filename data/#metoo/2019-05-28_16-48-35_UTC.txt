“Women can’t enact change. A myth of epic proportions. Many of us women have been told to pipe down. Dont be too loud, too bold, too outspoken. Don’t be too ambitious, too smart, to aggressive. If you are then maybe men will be intimidated by you, bosses will say you aren’t likable, friends will call you pushy and tell you to relax. I have heard all these comments from men and women alike, especially as I pursued a career in the legal field.

Tone it down, lighten up, don’t be “too much” have been consistent themes in the advice that has been given to me.  But if we take a look at history, we see that pushing a little, and in some cases a lot, has yielded great rewards personally, professionally, and culturally for women everywhere.

Being bold about the consistent wage gap between women and men is creating change albeit slow. Being honest about how women are treated in the workplace launched an entire movement. (#metoo). When we as women speak up about our rights, our needs, our truths, and get a little bold and pushy and ambitious, change is guaranteed to happen. We enact change every single day when we show up as our true authentic selves. When we cease to shrink and hide but rather step into exactly who we are.

It is often not without criticism, judgment, and even massive loss. But when women show up and speak up, change happens. I am where I am because of the bold, aggressive and tenacious women that came before me. Those women who didn’t back down paved the way for me to stand tall. I am me because they were them.”

So I eluded to the fact that this post was meant to be made, in the spirit of pride month I have a LGBT related rant. So as many of you remember we had encountered many, many interesting characters. From tucutes to people who used emoji pronouns. We have met so many people who treat being gay or trans, etc, as a trend and honestly it’s pretty fucking disgusting. Because using emoji pronouns doesn’t mean you’re trans, identifying as ‘autigender’ is not a thing and using your autism as a gender is frankly disgusting and this is from the perspective of someone with autism. Eef and I have both encountered accounts that want to rub elbows with the LGBT community to earn oppression points and fit in. It’s gross. Straight up, it’s disgusting.

When tall and gangly Jana Novak is unexpectedly scouted by a modelling agency and catapulted to superstardom, the seedy underbelly and predatory nature of the fashion industry begins to emerge and threaten the ordinary girl from south London. Juno Dawson's latest young adult offering is an honest and raw expose of an industry perceived as glamorous but rocked by allegations of misconduct, made even more timely by the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements.⠀

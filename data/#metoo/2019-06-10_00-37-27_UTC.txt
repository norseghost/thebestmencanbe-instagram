* it looks like empathy, to understand all sides, but i’m just trying to find myself through someone else’s eyes
*
From “NINE” by Ryan O’Neal (sleeping at last) link in comments

I waited a long time for this song. And it’s worth it. It almost hurts too much to listen to it.

Fundamentalist evangelicalism took so many of the beautiful parts of who I was created to be, and twisted them to give power to greedy and controlling men. Men who wanted to own and destroy. It’s magic, wild, holy, and joyful to see myself through my own eyes again. 
Born to carry love in this world? Yes please.

All of the kids are out of school on summer break, which typically results in them having more free time,more freedom, and opportunities to participate in recreational and social activities.
We encourage you to revisit the conversation about boundaries, body autonomy and good touch and bad touch. Regardless of your child’s age or gender, this is a necessary conversation because sex abuse occurs at daycare, day camp, athletic programs, summer camp, and at home with relatives and family friends.
Check their social media accounts and cell phones. Who are they talking to? How do you know they aren’t being approached by predators via social media apps and gaming consoles? Refer back to our series on social media apps and the various features that allow predators to engage them anonymously and secretly.
Lastly, juvenile sex trafficking is an extremely lucrative business. Talk to your child about engaging people they meet in familiar public spaces like the mall, park, beach, local community center, or the local store/bodega. Also, talk to them about going to “hang out” or “meet up” with friends of friends.
Whether you’re working or a stay at home parent, you need to be concerned and you need to have these conversations! Please don’t assume your child knows better or they aren’t at risk. #childsexabuseawareness #stopchildsexabuse #childsexabusesurvivor #parentsofchilldsexabusesurvivor #sexualassault #endchildsexabuse #endrapeculture #childabuse #sextrafficking #atlanta #ATL #Georgia #church #girls #teens #awareness #rapevictim #victim #children #prevention #trafficking  #survivor #tips #blogger #speaker #metoo #advocate #volunteer  #socialmedia

                        "text": "Trauma, anxiety and depression sometime stems from childhood injuries. Both physical and mental, especially abuse. Abusers can manipulate victims to stay quiet about the sexual abuse using a number of different tactics. Often an abuser will use their position of power over the victim to coerce or intimidate the child. They might tell the child that the activity is normal or that they enjoyed it. An abuser may make threats if the child refuses to participate or plans to tell another adult. Child sexual abuse is not only a physical violation; it is a violation of trust and/or authority. \nAccording to \u201cAmerican Nurse Today,\u201d Used with permission from Perspectives in Psychiatric Care.\n\nPsychological issues for this population often include anxiety, poor self-esteem, dysfunctional relationships, eating disorders, and PTSD. PTSD results from a threat to self or others accompanied by \u201cintense fear, horror, or helplessness,\u201d according to the Veteran\u2019s Administration National Center for PTSD. Maladaptive coping such as denial is overused. Those with a history of childhood sexual abuse have increased reports of fear, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, aggression, anger, hostility, poor self-esteem, and suicide attempts. Higher rates of depression are reported. Depression has also been shown to be associated with impaired immune functioning. Increased cytokines (inflammation) and cortisol (stress) have been identified as mechanisms by which immune system function is impaired and related to depression. Incidences of dysfunctional relationships, intimate partner violence, and self-destructive behavior are higher.\n(https://www.americannursetoday.com/long-term-health-outcomes-of-childhood-sexual-abuse/)\n#sicknotweak \n#breathe \n#mentalhealthblogger \n#childhoodsexualabuse \n#ptsd\n#mentalhealthmonth \n#childhoodinjuries\n#abuse\n#depression\n#research\n#metoo\n#trauma\n#manipulation\n#mentalhealthconditions\n#mentalhealthawareness \n#mentalheeling"

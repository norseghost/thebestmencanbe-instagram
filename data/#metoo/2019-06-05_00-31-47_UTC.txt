Tomorrow we start raising $$ to meet our year-end goals! Until now our Co-Founders have been doing their own crowdfunding, soliciting their family, friends, and fellow activists to keep the page running. But itâ€™s not enough! We need to raise 30k in 30 days to keep the lights on & meet our year end goals.

Now we need YOUR help to provide survivor services, resources, calls to action, and education to #EndAllAbuse

Stay tuned for our snazzy fundraiser video TOMORROW!

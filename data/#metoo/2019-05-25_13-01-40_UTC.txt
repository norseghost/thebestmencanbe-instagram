Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 80 women, and his former studio have reached a tentative $44 million deal to settle lawsuits with his accusers and other parties.
-
About $30 million would go to the accusers, studio creditors, and former employees of Weinstein Co.
-
The remaining $14 million would cover legal fees that Weinsteinâ€™s associates faced, including board members who were named as defendants in lawsuits.
-
The settlement would be paid by insurance policies and will not affect ongoing criminal lawsuits against him. What are your thoughts on the potential deal?

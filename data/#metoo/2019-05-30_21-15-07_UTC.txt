The last curtain call is only a couple of days away, two weeks sooner than planned, and I'm already teary-eyed and nostalgic. I've seen Emilia four times, twice at the Globe and twice at the Vaudeville, and each and every performance proved to be an incredibly cathartic experience. After a couple of hours of the most wholehearted laughter and heartfelt tears, I left the theatre feeling uplifted and empowered. In the era of #metoo and #timesup, Emilia reminded me that we are not alone. Our voices now resound louder than ever proving that together we can accomplish anything. I wish I could be there to see such an in tune ensemble of "clever women" once more for a final hurrah... If you haven't seen it, run and grab yourself a ticket! I assure you, it is a visceral experience that will transform you. It has certainly transformed me.  #iamemilia #cleverwoman #vaudevilletheatre #emiliabassano #feminism

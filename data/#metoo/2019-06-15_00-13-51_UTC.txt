Thanks to everyone who participated in our trauma yoga surveys and interviews. We are beyond grateful to all those willing to share even a little of their stories. Also major respect to the organizations, studios, counselors, people, and yoga teachers who lent a hand in getting the word out. Now itâ€™s time for my colleagues Pravina Rodrigues and Zipei Tang and I to put our thinking caps on and roll up our sleeves and dive into the exciting world of data analysis. Stay tuned, my friends. We will be updating our site and presenting our findings before the end of this summer. {Also If you still want to participate the survey will be live for a few more days.} #yoga

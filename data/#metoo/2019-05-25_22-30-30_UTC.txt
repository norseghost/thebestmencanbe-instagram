Just a reminder:  The data shows that making abortion illegal does not diminish the total number of abortions performed. All it does it exchange safe abortions with trained healthcare professionals for dangerous abortions that are potentially threatening to the womanâ€™s health and overall well-being.

If the real goal were to reduce the number of abortions, then the answer would be to increase access to birth control, including long acting reversible contraception such as IUDs.

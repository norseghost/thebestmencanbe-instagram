There was a time in my life in the not so distant past that I thought animals were here for our entertainment. Now I realized that these amazing beings go through awful abuse in order to trained to perform for us. I no longer support circuses even though on the outside it looks entertaining to us animals do not want to be kept in captivity. Animals want to be in the wild. Seeing these animals perform is not how to love animals. Please consider donating to a credible sanctuary instead.

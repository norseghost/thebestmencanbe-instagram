I never thought I\u2019d ever get the guts to leave.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nDuring the first few weeks after, I was diagnosed with Acute Stress Disorder (often a precursor to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and then a few months later, I was officially diagnosed with PTSD. I spent so many nights sobbing on the floor, absolutely terrified of everything. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI ended up still living with her in that tiny one bedroom apartment for about another month after we broke up (which was as awful as it sounds) and then once I found a new place to live, I had to pay for my half of the bills for the old apartment (because that lease wasn\u2019t up until September lol) AND the bills for my new one. I was very broke and very exhausted, but it was a step towards freedom. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nEventually, I reported her to my school via Title IX (the specific charges she faced were domestic violence and sexual assault), but the entire process was a joke and all it did was give her protection (school officials told me I couldn\u2019t tell anyone about the violence I\u2019d endured or warn anyone unless I wanted to be charged with \u201cretaliation\u201d). That set me back a lot. I was constantly in panic mode and I saw her basically every day on campus until I left town that spring (shout-out to all the times she showed up at Blackbird Coffee while I was doing various group projects and couldn\u2019t leave). \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCurrently, my mental health is still pretty messy and I honestly haven\u2019t forgiven my abuser, but I have forgiven myself. It wasn\u2019t my fault that she continued to hurt me and traumatize me. It wasn\u2019t my fault that I didn\u2019t know I deserved better for so long. I\u2019m still angry at her, and I probably always will be to some extent\u2014 but that\u2019s okay. My anger helped push me to leave. My anger saved me. Here\u2019s to 3 years of growth and healing. Heres to finally being able to speak up. Here\u2019s to building a new goddamn house. \ud83c\udfe1 \ud83d\udc9c"

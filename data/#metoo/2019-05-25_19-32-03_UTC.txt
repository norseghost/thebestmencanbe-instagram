The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all. 🌸 •

A year ago today I “graduated” from CSULB. In these photos I was still feeling constantly afraid of the campus and my hometown. While I am not incredibly proud to list this institution on my resume, I wear its name as a reminder of my strength and my mission to share that strength with little girls everywhere. As teachers, administrators, and parents the message we give to our children can define the future of our world and how they see themselves. So again, thank you to the incredible professors of the CSULB Dance Department who convinced me to push through and believed in who I am at my core. That girl is now thriving and ready to share your undeniable love with her own pupil.🥰Congrats to all my friends who graduated this week. #mentalhealthawareness #metoo

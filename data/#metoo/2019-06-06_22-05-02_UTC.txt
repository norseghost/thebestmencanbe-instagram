"A large percentage of children do not disclose abuse until adulthood, if ever. Recent studies suggest that 10% to 33% of sexual abuse victims never disclose their abuse. When they do disclose, the studies show that most child sexual abuse victims only disclose to a friend of their own age, and only about 8% of sexual abuse victims disclose the abuse to professionals.⠀
⠀
Some long-term consequences of child sexual abuse include fear, loneliness, anxiety, self-blame, poor self-esteem, anger, and mental health issues."⠀
⠀
If you're being abused or have been abused, please call the Betty Griffin Center 24-hour crisis hotline at (904) 824-1555 or TDD users dial 711.⠀

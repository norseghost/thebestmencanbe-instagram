This is dedicated to all the sensitive, loving ðŸ¥° and strong mothers and women out there in the ðŸŒŽ. We may cry at the drop of a hat but showing emotions DOES NOT make us weak especially in front of our children. It teaches them that itâ€™s ok to share emotions and that they can trust you with theirs. Crying does not mean weak and vulnerable, itâ€™s just the opposite. It means youâ€™re passionate ðŸ’ª. Stay strong and carry on. This @blanktagco sticker looks awesome on my @hydroflask and @officialcricut inspired design donâ€™t you think? ðŸ˜Š#momlife #sisepuede #anxiety #postpartumdepression #warriormom #metoo #intrusivethoughts #postpartumocd #depression #OCD #ADD #blanktagco #cricut #hydroflask #cbt #chillona #crybaby #bilingual

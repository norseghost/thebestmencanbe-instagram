The director of one of the best short films I have ever been in: PETAL. @georgehunta. Thank you so much for telling this beautiful and heart wrenching little story. You putting this amazing project together has given voice to a subject that people to this day don’t understand. This girl is a true queen, supporting women in everything they do. Being a part of @petalshortfilm makes my heart soar because of all the AMAZING women that went into making it happen. Through some of the worst trials and tribulations a short film could face, this feminist film still managed to speak volumes and ALL of that could not have happened without this amazing lady. Thank you for inviting me into Elsie’s flower shop! #womeninfilm #petalpower #feminist #metoo

What is "slut-shaming"? Short answer: Slut-shaming is the idea of shaming or attacking a person, normally a woman or a girl for being sexual, having one or more sexual partners, acknowledging sexual feelings, and/or acting on sexual feelings.

Furthermore, it’s “about the implication that if a woman has sex that traditional society disapproves of, she should feel guilty and inferior” (Alon Levy, Slut Shaming). It is damaging not only to the people targeted, but to society as a whole. The consequences of slut-shaming go beyond the personal, shaping societal discourses on rape, abuse, and harassment:

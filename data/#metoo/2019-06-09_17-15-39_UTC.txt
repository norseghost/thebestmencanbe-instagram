After sentencing Brock Turner to only 6 months which could have been as much as 14 years, he has faced unrelenting pressure to be removed from the bench. 
During the sentencing of Turner who was chased by two men on bicycles who came upon him sexually  assaulting an unconscious woman, Persky noted how both the defendant and victim were intoxicated and the impact prison would have on Turner. Turner only served 3 months in jail. 
Turner’s father defended his son in a public letter stating that his son should not have to go to prison for “twenty minute of action.” Over 90,000 people signed a petition thanks to the hard work of volunteers who created a coalition to make the recall vote a possibility. 60% of voters voted to have Persky removed, something that has not happened in California in 86 years.#judgepersky #brockturner #rapeculture #itsonus #nomore #sexualassault #victimblaming #metoo #breakthecycle #defendinnocence #saam #mamabeareffect #consent

Rp @stephzupan STEP 1: be vegan and stop supporting an industry that kills animals for unnecessary reasons 
STEP 2: take action and get active to help more individuals become vegan! 
Not sure how to get active?Check out @thesavemovement and find vigils near you. By attending vigils it gives you an opportunity to bear witness and get photos and videos you can share with others. Or attend a cube of truth through @anonymousforthevoiceless where you can talk to individuals about veganism. Or find your local @directactioneverywhere and take part in a disruption. Or use your social media platform to spread the truth. 
These are just a few options to get you active within your community! With so many options why aren‚Äôt you being active? 
Remember, no matter what type of activism you do, all forms are important and necessary!! üñ§

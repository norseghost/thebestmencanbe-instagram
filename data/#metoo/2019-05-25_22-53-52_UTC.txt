I can do it better than they are.
.
I really dont like this persons content.
.
I am so much more talented than that other person.

WHY ARE WE SO CONSUMED WITH WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING!

The simple idea is this... Stop focusing on the actions of others and focus on your potential 
Your actions will light up the world and create the future you want to achieve.

Your complaining about the shortcomings of others will not. 
Focus on YOUR future and your world will change.

Btw...start NOW!

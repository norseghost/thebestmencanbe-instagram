Without getting too wordy, I just want to share this late post of Sunnyâ€™s graduation. I think that sometimes we forget how difficult being a kid can be, and how much they struggle to not disappoint us as well as their peers. Every child faces obstacles but it is with great love and support that they are able to achieve their goals. So I wanted to take this moment to thank everyone who has loved and supported Sunny throughout his life, dealing with everything he has gone through. Without you all life would have been so much harder for him. Thank you for always loving him and helping him. We appreciate you all! @mommymargie_ @sharkcity1408 @talala.lomas @heyyyrey @lifewithyvette @kthizzle__ @angiehernandezchapa @thechappaa @xromayor624 @m.molina.vfx @kitten_toot @aye.lizzyy @creolequeendawnie @stevennnduarteee @gabriella7310 @jason_sara_15

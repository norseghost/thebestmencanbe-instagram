What bothers me about her doing this show on the Central Park Five. 
American feminist movements are one of the main reasons why we even had a Central Park Five. 
The #metoo movement is about believing the survivors and throwing away any due process. How can you support that and do a mini film on the Central Park Five??? That's what happened to them.
What I'm seeing is opportunist in our community profiting off of black death and oppression and it's becoming extremely obvious.

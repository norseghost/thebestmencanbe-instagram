Poetry by the Geisha dance concert choreographer @wilma_emilia_kuosa 
The Other Grils "I’ve heard that the other girls are a little bit better
They just tolerate without a shiver
I’ve heard that they're the ones that are a little bit older
Who can beat the race with the turtle
They won’t collapse into their shell
When they get scared

The other women are reportedly better
They'll just listen and won't question
They are more beautiful
And their mascara doesn’t run over coffee
When they try to correct the wrongdoing

I’ve heard that little girls are bad
Cause they often get so sad
Over the evil world
That they should grow up faster
Start to match the men
Just like their mothers

I’ve heard that young women are weak
Because they let the harassment show
They freeze without a reaction
Collapse under power
Cry in constriction

They

should

just

be

collected

squeaking

from

upsetting

the balance

of the world

where

we

can’t

breathe

Hiding behind status
Wearing power structures
As their armors
So that from below
They can try to skim
Those young girls
Who still have the courage
To cry for HELP

In a man’s world these problems don’t exist
There are only quick & easy solutions
That you should already know by heart
Understand without seeing
Swallow without excepting"

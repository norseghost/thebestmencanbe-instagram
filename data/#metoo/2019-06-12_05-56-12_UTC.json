CW: Abuse\n\nWhen I was being physically, emotionally, and sexually abused I told myself a lot of convincing lies: I could never survive without my abusers, it was my job to protect them, I must have deserved it somehow, anything but the truth. After I met Elliott I found the courage to seek professional help and started on the terrifying and liberating path toward truth and healing.\n\u2022\nOne of the biggest challenges in my journey has been learning to reclaim spaces that have been taken from me. Working with Atlas has helped me to learn new ways to train my body and mind to find safety in spaces I thought I had lost forever.\n\u2022\nWhen I made the difficult decision to cut all abusers out of my life I made a pact with myself to never be held hostage by the lie of my own unworthiness again. While I chose to take my husband\u2019s last name I knew I also needed to reclaim my own identity for myself. So Elliott, Atlas, and I went down to the courthouse and legally changed my middle name to Saoirse which means freedom in Irish. My chosen name reminds me that my freedom is something that can never be taken from me again.\n\u2022\nAs I\u2019ve become more and more sick and lost the ability to live the life I had planned my middle name still stands. No matter how many limitations, illnesses, struggles, or hardships I face my freedom is always my own.\n\u2022\n#freedom #saoirse #reclaim #name #survivor #abuse #cptsd #ptsd #metoo #takingupspace #chronicallyill #unstoppable #chronicillness #spoonie #spoonies #thespooniesisterhood #servicedog #servicedogs #selfcare #selflove #servicedogsofinstagram #iweigh #disablednotdefeated"

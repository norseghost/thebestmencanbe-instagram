“A nation can rise no higher than its woman” - The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan 
For hundreds of years now women of color have been the victim of white supremacist patriarchal oppression which has created severe trauma that’s been passed from womb to reality for generations . 
As men of color , the exaltation our women from the subjugated condition of  white patriarchal supremacy must be our primary focus. To neglect the woman is to neglect our very existence . Is it a wonder why humanity is in a sin-sick condition ?! When women can be abused , defiled , disrespected , disregarded , degraded and ignored then humanity has truly entered into a place of spiritual darkness and decay . 💎💎👸🏽👸🏾👸🏻👸🏿🌹🌷 #wearefarrakhan #nationofislam #elijahmuhammad #ramadan #ramadanmubarak #metoo #feminism #feminista #209 #stockton #blackgirlmagic #blackexcellence #

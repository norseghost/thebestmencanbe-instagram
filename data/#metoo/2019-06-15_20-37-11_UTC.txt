-BY ALL MEANS FEEL FREE TO REPOST THIS BUT PLEASE GIVE ME CREDIT AS THESE ARE MY PERSONAL PHOTOS💙- so i went to Sheffield Millennium Gardens & Gallery today and the amount of things around positivity and encouragement made me feel warm inside💗 so i thought i’d share some of these items with you lovely lot☺️
—-SLIDE TWO—-
i know the writing is small so i’m going to write it here:
Hey You!
yes you, you’re it!
You’re the one.
You happen all the time
every second you’re happening.
From all the billions and zillions of molecules that could be something else, someone else
it was “you” that was made and forged in that microscopic infinitesimal crucible.
Unique, singular, the only one
the rarest of the rarest
you’re a walking miracle of all those molecules.
That means you matter, you’re actually matter.
don’t let anyone tell you otherwise 
you’re a living poem
you’re the art of matter
you 
living
breathing
beautiful you!
- Hey You! by Richard Hawley.

i love that so much. live by it, you’re beautiful.💙

"This Wall Wont Make You Famous" started from the frustration of — I do all the things asked; I vote, I donate, I support, I cut down plastics, I care for animals, I work on myself, I support community, but I felt like it wasn't enough. I was becoming unsettled.⠀⠀ ⠀⠀
Then I went to a talk by @werisela called, "The Role of Art & Creativity in Change Making," with @obeygiant @vcassinova @uzumaki.gallery @k6mil and @annabulbrook and they moved me.⠀⠀
⠀⠀
I saw women my age and younger doing their thing, explaining emotions and experiences that I'm having myself, and making change. That's what lead me to this thought experiment, to find my artist voice, use art as my therapy, make safer spaces for others, and bring awareness to issues I care about.⠀⠀
⠀⠀
Also, thank you to Shepard Fairey —an undeniable force. I watched your work grow as a little girl in San Diego, so here I go.⠀⠀

I got tired of fake friends planning trips to visit these walls to take selfies, and their attempts to get "discovered' but with nothing to say.⠀⠀
We should be placing our energy in a cause that moves us, with a point of view and opinion. The time it takes to plan, go to these locations, take photos, post, edit, etc... could be spent on so much MORE. Social networks are a powerful tool that can reach millions. Use it to OPEN EYES and OPEN MINDS.⠀⠀
-----⠀⠀
Also, don't lose the artist or the meaning behind these murals. Look at them and reflect. Artist, make something with a point of view.⠀⠀
I'm tired of vapid shit.⠀⠀
THOUGHT EXPERIMENT OUT!⠀⠀

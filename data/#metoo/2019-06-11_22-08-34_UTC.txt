🌺 team member @palexbr took our #cultivateconsent zine to Chicago over the weekend to hold space for collective healing and growth at the @mysticsoulproject conference!
.
🦋 Themed Radical Wholeness, the convening brought together social leaders at the intersections of mysticism, activism, spirituality and healing to skill share and take intentional space to slow down and center care, pleasure, and joy to bring to life their whole being. A POC centered space, the convening intentionally centered the needs of those historically marginalized from having access to spaces rooted in exploration and actualization of the whole self through storytelling, movement and dance, visioning/dreaming exercises, interactive workshops, and healing modalities from around the world (including reiki, acupuncture, sound healing, tarot/astrology)!
.
🌴 Featured above are @sohumdore (a queer visual artist and performer originally from Chicago) and @dunxie (a queer Jamaican healer, witch, herbalist, astrologist). We are so grateful to have held space to share our zine with them!

HYSTERIA 006 // I reject the notion that it’s not OK to be angry. In fact, I don’t think we allow ourselves to be angry enough.
.
Anger is important. It lets us know something is wrong, and it calls attention to something that matters if not to ourselves, then to someone else. Anger consumes a lot of energy and singular focus. It’s raw and messy, and makes us uncomfortable.
.
We are repulsed by anger in our society, so we do everything we can to avoid expressing it. Women in particular tend to rationalize our anger, which not only invalidates the pain at the root of it, but also prevents us from growing and embracing all of the things we can learn from it.
.
Believing that our anger is irrelevant or that it’s wrong to express it leaves us at its mercy. So, today, I’m honoring it.
.
It makes me angry when:
.
The government tries to tell me what I can and cannot do with my body;
.
The government cages children and claims it’s for my protection;
.
The government imprisons dissenters and whistleblowers;
.
Police murder people of color;
.
Police get away with murdering people of color (or anyone for that matter);
.
Men think they can touch me without my consent;
.
Women get paid less for jobs we’re as good or better at doing than men;
.
Women stab each other in the back;
.
Friends don’t show up for you, but still expect you to show up for them;
.
People lie;
.
People cheat;
.
People steal;
.
People pretend they are something they are not;
.
People don’t stand up for themselves or others;
.
People judge others for something they themselves are unwilling to do;
.
People don’t try their best;
.
People play both sides of the fence;
.
People take advantage of other people;
.
People make assumptions about me;
.
People don’t listen, with their minds or their hearts;
.
People think they are better than me;
.
People tell me I’m too angry or overreacting;
.
People call me crazy;
.
People tell me I’m not likable enough;
.
People try to invalidate my feelings;
.
People don’t take me seriously;
.
I do any of the above.
.

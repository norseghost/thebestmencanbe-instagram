Folate is extremely important because it helps make DNA and other genetic material. If you were to get pregnant and decide to keep the pregnancy, it’s imperative you take enough folate, especially within the first month when it’s most important for cell growth. 
I’m unsure why my Ob/Gyn didn’t talk to me about this when I told her I have Celiac disease, but for all the other people who have Celiac disease and can get pregnant, I beg you to talk to your doctor about which folate dietary supplement to take. 
My doctor never talked to me about this and my daughter was later diagnosed with Spina Bifida (among many other diagnoses). Having to end a wanted pregnancy because I was too unhealthy to be pregnant (causing my daughter to be too unhealthy to survive) was the hardest thing I’ve gone through. 
Doctors are legally allowed to lie about fetal abnormalities in Texas, so it’s up to us to do the research.

A fun musical extravaganza based on the popular film with music by Dolly Parton. The material gains new relevance and power in the age of #MeToo. Was never really a fan of country or country-esque music but somehow The Voice and American Idol have made the genre more accessible over the years, so I was excited to see it. It didn’t change my life but it also didn’t disappoint 👍🏼

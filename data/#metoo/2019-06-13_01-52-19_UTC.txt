We’ve been collecting our communities’ stories. It is taking us a while to fully process the stories they have shared with this. For now, we simply want to thank you for sharing your narratives with us. They are such powerful and challenging stories. There is more to come, but for now - thank you and we are so glad to do this work with you. #ImReady2019 #OurVoicesOurPower

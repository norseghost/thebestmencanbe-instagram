I think all my mom really wants for her 70th birthday is a montage of every picture on my phone since her last birthday of me wearing pants. Well, here you go Ma! At least one day where you can focus on celebrating yourself without having to worry about the embarrassing sideshow youâ€™ve raised me to be! Love you! #blessed #mom #barfdaygirl #70isthenew50 #pants #shirt #dresstoimpress #blacksheep #fortunateson #shetellsmeimadopted #metoo

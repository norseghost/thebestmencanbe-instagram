                        "text": "Honor her.\u2800\nThe Honorable Judge Aquilina. (@authoraquilina)\u2800\n\u2800\nI had the pleasure of asking her some deep questions at our latest @equalityleague event. In case you don't know who she is, she was the judge who oversaw Larry Nassar's sentencing for countless cases of sexual abuse and child pornography.\u2800\n\u2800\nWhat amazes me still about her experience is how she let everyone who wanted to speak, speak. She allowed more than 150 women and girls to confront Nassar and welcomed others to speak (accusers and defendants) if they felt moved to. She listened to all of them. Hours of raw emotion and pain.\u2800\n\u2800\nShe believes that the courtroom is meant to be a healing space and part of that healing starts with the expression of trauma. This is how she approaches ALL of her cases and it takes an amazing person to hold space in this way, even for people we tend to label as criminals.\u2800\n\u2800\nI believe that it is people like the Judge who are going to change this world by giving people the space to be heard and to process. To release, to be heard and move from a place of greater ease and clarity.\u2800\n\u2800\n\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u2800\n\u2800\nGo read the book The Girls by Abigail Pesta when it comes out. Pesta goes deep with Aquilina and many of the survivors and their stories. This will be one of the most important books of the year.\u2800\n\u2800\n#womenssports #womeninsports #motivation #inspiration #thefutureisfemale #feminism  #femaleathletes #sports #activewomen #girlpower #women #girlboss #ladyboss #strongwomen #genderequality #womenempowerment #declareyourambition #womensupportingwomen #womenempoweringwomen #empoweringwomen #femaleempowerment #larrynassar #metoo #usagymnastics #judgeaquilina #equalityleague"

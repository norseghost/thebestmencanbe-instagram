THE STATE OF WOMENS HEALTH | Did you know? In 2015, nearly 19 million women died from non-communicable diseases - these are typically preventable, lifestyle based diseases. Of these, cardiovascular disease is the top cause of womenâ€™s death worldwide.â €
Self-harm, including suicide was the second leading cause of death globally among females aged 15â€“29.â €
One in every three women is likely to experience physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime.â €
One woman dies every 2 minutes from preventable issues related to pregnancy and childbirth.â €
Let those statistics sink in for a moment.

Where have we gone wrong? What can we do? What does this make you feel? Shocked, outraged, saddened, disappointed, something else?

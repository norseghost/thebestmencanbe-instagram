And- cis men’s rights but for trans folx. 
Thin privilege but for fat people. Straight privilege but for gay people. 
White people’s rights but for people of colour. Settler’s rights but for Indigenous people. 
Able bodied rights but for people with disabilities (inclusion and accessibility- to medical care, washrooms, transportation, within the workplace, the right to move through the world without judgemental stares and comments).
Equal rights. Equanimity. Justice. 
An agenda worth pushing, wouldn’t you say?

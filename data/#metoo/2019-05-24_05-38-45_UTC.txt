... finally, she’s admitted! 👩🏻‍⚖️ One of our many paralegals-turned-lawyer who was probably actually born in our office, Isa lives in both our Litigation and Workplace Relations teams, specialising in regulatory and employment work. 
She has a handy side-line in helping to set up charities and has been heavily involved in our work on the #metoo movement.  She’s smart, funny and captain of our mostly non-existent basketball team. 
Isa has come a long way from having to borrow her sister’s skirt for court appearances, now proudly owning her own wardrobe and being generally quite grown-up.  Still, her sense of the ridiculous is never too far below that serenely professional surface. Isa is always a positive voice and excellent value, regardless of context. #admission #sydneylawyers #lawyer #supremecourt

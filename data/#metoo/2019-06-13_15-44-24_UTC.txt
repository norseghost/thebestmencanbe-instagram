📝PARENTING TIP OF THE DAY
.
.
🎁Always let adults, teachers, coaches, baby sitters, nannies, care takers, and older children know that your children need permission before receiving any 🎁 gifts. .
.
🎁Grooming is a secret and special relationship between the perpetrator and victim. Sexual Assault Perpetrators use tactics such as secrets, rewards, gifts, special privileges, secret friendships, favors, isolation, and fulfilling the child’s unmet needs as a way to increase their vulnerability, and gain the child’s, and your trust. If a child and adults are aware of the gift exchange rule, it will deter them from gaining access and control over our children.

🤷🏾‍♀️Why is this important? Simply because gift giving usually precedes sexual touches they may appear innocent the first time a child is violated. #buddy_speaks

TOMORROW is the big day! My 30-minute special is airing Sunday, May 26 at 2 PM EST/11 AM PST on Trinity Broadcast Network (TBN). Who's going to be tuning in and watching with me?? I'll be sharing about my journey of overcoming Cancer, and you'll get a special opportunity to get an advanced print copy of my new book: How I Beat Cancer.

Will you join me in praying that people who need to hear this message of healing will tune in tomorrow. 
Tag someone in the comments who is battling cancer or looking to prevent ever getting the disease!

P.S. If you can't catch it tomorrow, it will air again on Sunday, June 3 at 9:30 PM EST/6:30 PM PST.

💖 Tarana J. Burke is a civil rights activist that founded the Me Too Movement 💖 In 2006, Burke began using the phrase “Me Too” to raise awareness of the pervasiveness of sexual abuse and assault in society, and the phrase developed into a broader movement, following the 2017 use of #MeToo as a hashtag after the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations 💪 @taranajaneen

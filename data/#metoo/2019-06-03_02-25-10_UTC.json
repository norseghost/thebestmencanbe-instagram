It\u2019s been bothering me for years and writing is my therapy. This is trauma that stays in my mind every day while he gets to walk around without a care in the world. So here goes... .\n.\nI was 20, in Italy on a night out, I wanted to dance and drink. I remember being surprised by his presence. A familiar face, in a crowd of strangers. He walked me outside, he knew I very rarely drank, and how drunk I was. I slurred my words while I spoke about my boy back in Melbourne. A boy he was friendly with but obviously didn\u2019t approve of. I remember going on about vomiting earlier in the night and how badly I needed to pee. He said he lived close by.\n.\nI didn\u2019t think much of it. I needed to pee, he offered me a place to pee.... Then things get fuzzy. It felt like the longest walk to his place. I vaguely remember walking over old bridges, and down cobble stone roads. .\n.\nI don\u2019t remember what the house looked like or how we got to the room. I do remember a bed in attic, with a bathroom. I could finally pee. .\nI wanted to sleep. I remember him kissing me, I said I didn\u2019t want to have sex when he asked and I don\u2019t know if we did ...as the rest is blank. .\n.\nI woke up naked. He was sitting in a leather chair, doing work. Apparently he didn\u2019t sleep. I couldn\u2019t find my undies, I ran to the bathroom needing to vomit again. .\n.\nI had no idea where I was. I was so confused. I asked him to walk me to a cab, reluctantly he did. .\nI needed to understand what happened. He was my friend and that\u2019s what I wanted to believe. \u201cIt must of been okay.\u201d I told myself that over and over again. .\n.\nA few weeks later, still confused and uncomfortable. I asked him what happened. He gave me some vague response then became cold and distant. I still tried to be his friend. I didn\u2019t want this to be real... Did he know what he did was wrong? .\nIt took me months to realise that night was not okay. .\n.\n.\nContinued in the comments ..."

Wouldn't it be cool to travel back in time !? I had a crazy dream last night about someone I know and her little girl got kidnapped and I actually found the kidnapper and saved her daughter,  it was so crazy and so it brought me back to an actual issue going on in our world right before our eyes it's always at the back of my mind , but imagine if your child was a victim of child sex abuse from  a peaodphile how trusting are you with the people in your child's life who are left alone with your children ? I have put up  some stories about this subject,  I am such a helicopter mum and I wouldn't have it any other way. I want people to rise up and stand up for our children be their voice and don't be afraid to be  that mum who stays at all the events with your child wether it's a sporting event, a school event,  a church event , even a counselling appointment, these are all common places to find the well known pedo. I just want all kids to have a safe happy life and it starts with us !

Put your most relevant experience at the top of your resume. And go through internal referrals to make a personal introduction to the role you are interested.\n\nWhat are some important but often overlooked Do\u2019s and Dont\u2019s of the interview process?\nShow confidence and not arrogance. Be yourself and dress appropriately for the company and the role that you are applying for. Think about your audience and who you are interviewing with when preparing for your upcoming interview. I would suggest to not bring up pay or vacation days. And do not show up late!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nShe will be a speaker at our next event on June 10th \u201cThe Power of Our Voice\u201d with will focus on the era of the #MeToo movement, the rules of the workplace are changing  for women and men.

This morning I saw a story about the “Mosuo” dubbed the Kingdom of Women in China. I was instantly intrigued. Where the women basically rule and are highly respected. There were so many things about this place that totally amazed me. (If you get a chance look on YouTube). The reason I choose to post about them was I could not believe they do not have a word in the vocabulary for RAPE. That absolutely floored me. Due to the gender roles and the respect that men have for the women. It is not something that happens or occurs there. What a beautiful place. If I never get to visit there I hope or if there is such a thing as reincarnation that I end up there. #kingdomofwomen #mosuo  #norapesociety #womenboss #womenrule #womenrulemendrool #whyididntreport #sexualabusesurvivor #wewillnotbesilenced  #warrior #abuse #abusesurvivor #childabusesurvivor #rapesurvivor #rape

Healing is a slow and often painful process. We fight so hard to push away the trauma and pain that we begin to loose ourselves in the fight. The hardest thing can sometimes be allowing yourself  to rest and let the pain wash over you. In this way we can release it from our bodies, clearing space for new light and health.

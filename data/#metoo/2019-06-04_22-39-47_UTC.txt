Since 2016, I have wondered what overturning Roe v. Wade would do to our country and our women. Between the protests and reading the articles- it’s getting harder to tell the difference between then and now. Black women are often left out of these conversations so let’s start with three names you should look up: Byllye Avery, Florynce Kennedy, & Dorothy Roberts. Now that you’ve become slightly more aware of how the reproductive health of Black women has been compromised through racism AND discriminatory healthcare practices SINCE slavery, I’m sure you wouldn’t be surprised to learn that even today we still don’t have equal access to quality healthcare. THEREFORE, the idea of making it even more dangerous and expensive for women to terminate a pregnancy (whether through rape, incest, or consensual intercourse - ALL of which require male participation) will not leave us to return to a pre-Roe v. Wade era- these laws will do much worse. MOREOVER, this current threat to our right to reproductive healthcare is a national crisis. I feel charged to take action. Posting on social media isn’t enough. I wrote, directed, & produced a short #ItHappenedOneNight and still I want to do more... Too many women have fought for this & us - we cannot go backwards. We have to pave the way for a better future.

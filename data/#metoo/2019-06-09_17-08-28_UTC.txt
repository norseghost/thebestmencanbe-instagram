Our own little Gina, the founder and director of Stop the Shaming, on her way to DC to fight for proper sex education for the youngsters in schools everywhere. Thanks to SIECUS, or the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, Gina was invited to speak and tell her story to lawmakers at a congressional briefing tomorrow which will hopefully help convince them that the current Sexual Risk Avoidance program implemented in schools today is still abstinence-only sex education and is not at all effective. You make that change, girl! So proud! #SRAisAbstinenceOnly #stoptheshaming #sexed

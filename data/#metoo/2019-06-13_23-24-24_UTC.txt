News from my little heart to yours! I am honoured to have been asked to be apart of a panel discussion that is taking place after the presentation of an exclusive documentary happening at The Princess Theatre next Sunday! 
This is a Public Documentary Screening and Panel Discussion with local Edmonton experts for "Brain Heart World". There’s no shaming involved, it’s awesomely hopeful, it’s pretty appropriately humorous, and it speaks directly to youth AND adults. When you consider what kind of resources are out there right now concerning the topic of porn, there are very few that speak directly to young people even though youth are the ones dealing with this issue on a greater scale than ever before. Elizabeth Smart is also interviewed in the docuseries. 
Porn is not the only issue that causes pain around sexual health, this documentary opens up conversations about sex as a whole in a real and progressive way. Join us for an inexpensive and informative does of soul food.

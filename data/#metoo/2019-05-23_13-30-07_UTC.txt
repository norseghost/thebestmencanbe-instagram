Twice yesterday, older men I didn't know made inappropriate comments about my body to my face, once at work and once while I was shopping for groceries. When I got home, I ran outside to my garden to sink my hands into the earth, to hack away at the soil with my hoe and trowel, to feel my body move for me alone. I took a picture as I worked so I had proof that I exist. #metoo #inthegarden #naturetherapy

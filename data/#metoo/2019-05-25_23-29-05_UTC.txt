They love their stories 
Love to categorize me into a sin
Wish real badly he would’ve slashed it across my throat 
Taste the blood on his fingertips as a form of love
And held his honor 
Because cameras keep watching
Self respect is only in modesty, black and white narcissist is honorable when it’s a role on you
Half scared to death
Half scared to life
Tip toe crawl into your steps
Your devil is the color of milk and my doings is the color of poison 
Little girl- innocence never looked this good
Hold it high don’t give em smth to talk about 
Your little girl
Is little for her father, lover, son
Your little girl is not so little darling

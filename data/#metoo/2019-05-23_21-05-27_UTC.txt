#ThrowbackThursday: Last month we reunited with @browngirlmag and @karunachani to host #MeToo: South Asians Break the Silence for the second year in a row. The event was a platform and safe space for South Asian survivors in our community to share their stories of sexual harassment and assault. The experiences shared by each panelist were told with courage and a cause—to create awareness so more people may be emboldened to share their own truths.

As the topics of domestic and sexual violence are incredibly sensitive and personal, we are deeply moved by the commitment of those who attended to to bear witness to the panelists’ experiences and create a space of collective healing.

While healing is a process and self-care looks different for everyone, Sakhi is always available if you, or someone you know, needs our support. Sakhi is committed to working towards gender justice and to showing up for those who have been affected by domestic violence and/or sexual violence in their lives. Our helpline number is 1-212-868-6741.⠀
⠀
In solidarity.

Two articles today on BC campus sexual violence policies.

First, from last week SFCC members Connor Spencer and Chantelle Spicer call on the BC Government to improve BC campus sexual violence policies and provide proper resources for ending campus sexual violence. These include proper oversight and funding. http://bit.ly/2I0rKBU

And the second, published yesterday detailed the provincial government's investment of $760,000 to fight sexual violence on campus. In this article, both Connor and Chantelle note that the funding is an important first, but future action, including permanent funding is still required. http://bit.ly/2Zp03bT üìù @thevancouversun üì∏ Jason Payne

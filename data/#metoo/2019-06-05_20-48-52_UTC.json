                        "text": "Oftentimes #smeartest and #cervicalscreening are portrayed as easy, painless, nothing to worry about, few minutes of discomfort and it's over experiences. But for millions of women and people with vaginas this is simply not the case.\nAs a sexual violence and medical abuse survivor with #ptsd and #vaginismus I know this all too well. I also know I've faced a lot of backlash and received a lot of hate comments for publicly sharing my experience wity gynecology and smear tests which admittedly don't paint those things in the best light. Sharing this kind of experience is often seen as discouraging other's from participating in #CervicalCancer screening, and results in the silancing of people with traumatic smear experiences and is successfully making positive, happy, painless smear test stories the only ones we hear. That isn't fair, to anyone. People deserve to hear both stories, and people who have been harmed by screening matter and deserve a voice. The Wrong Side of the Speculum wants to give people that voice.\nShare your less than cheerful smear experiences. You can shoot us a DM, comment below, or send an email to the.wrong.side.of.the.speculum@gmail.com (also linked on our profile)\nA few stories, with the senders permission might make it into a informational package about why cervical screening must change will be sent to the NHS, the American College of Gynecology And Obstetrics, Eve Appeal, and Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust.\n\n#cervicalcancerawareness #smeartestssavelives #checkmeup #reproductiverights #reproductiverightsarehumanrights #ReproductiveJustice #reproductivehealth #feminist #Feminism #metoo #timeisup #cervicalscreeningawarenessweek #SayNoToSmears #WhyIDontScreen #lgbtq\ud83c\udf08 #endometriosis"

"I won't be silenced! You can't keep me quiet. Won't tremble when you try it. Cause I know that I won't go speechless."

I read somewhere that the inspiration for the song was the line "You're speechless I see...A fine quality in a wife." said by Jafar in the original animated movie and the Me Too movement. It's a very moving song and I'm more excited because almost every disney princess has a song singing about how she feels expected Jasmine. Now she has one.

The latest edition of our intelligent magazine, Foursight, is about coming together to challenge attitudes and inspire change. Chi-chi Nwanoku OBE from BAME orchestra Chineke! talks about amplifying diversity in classical music, chair of the British Fashion Council, Stephanie Phair, underlines the need to lead the industry down a sustainable runway and chief executive at the British Science Association, Katherine Mathieson, tells us what we need to do to spark equality in science. 
We are thrilled that Dylan Jones, editor of GQ for 20 years, found the time to talk to us about the #MeToo movement, gender politics and much more. There are also stories about books, food, travel, placemaking, artificial intelligence and blockchain - so hopefully there is something to pique everyone's interest.

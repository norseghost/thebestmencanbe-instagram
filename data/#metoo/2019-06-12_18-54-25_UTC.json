Also, to help all students who pass through the school cook with Love.\nShe is Academic Director and Chef instructor at Umami Center For Culinary Arts.\n\nChef Renee is inspired by quite a few people like #AnneSophiePic - a French chef best known for gaining three Michelin stars for her restaurant, Maison Pic, in southeast France.\u00a0She's also inspired by #GordonRamsey.\n\nVisit www.hernetwork.co/5questionswithher (link in bio) to read more.\n-\n#HerNetwork | #5QuestionsWithHer\n-\n#womeninspiringwomen #Flourish19 #herglobalnetwork #inspiringwomen #femaleempowerment #globalgoals #bossbabe #herglobal #girlbosslife #womenofimpact #metoo #inspirationalquotes #empoweringwomen #womanist #melaninmagic #sheconquers #goodquotes #womeninbiz #Affirmations #womenempowerment #podcasts #forqueensbyqueens #RealWomenRealNetwork #inspirationdaily"

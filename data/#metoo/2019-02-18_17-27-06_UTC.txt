Problematic people understand one thing and that is disregard. Make them taste their own medicine. Don't fall for apologies either as "Sorry" only means something when actions reflect change. You can't be sorry if you're not changing behaviors and learning from your mistakes. None of us is perfect but that's no excuse for inhumane attitudes, in jest or otherwise. ✌🏽

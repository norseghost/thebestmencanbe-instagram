My darling sisters. Today and every day I am reminded that we must stand together. Listen to one another, love one another, and support one another.  I keep you all close to my heart. I will help you fight. I have already fought this battle; may my experiences and strength be a light which helps you fight your own battle. We are many. We stand together, and we shall not be quiet. #metoo #riseup #womensupportingwomen #inspire #love #happiness #whoseyourhero #strong #fight #iwontbequiet #survivor #noonesvictim #iamstrong #iamkind #iamforgiven #iamloved #blessed #grace

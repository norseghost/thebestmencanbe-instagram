hi everyone. to start this out i figured i would introduce myself and what this page is going to be. about a year ago i was raped. since then, i’ve only told two people about what happened. but i rarely talk to them about it and mostly try to figure everything out and deal with it on my own. i’ve found it to be really difficult dealing with this and internalizing it. i struggle finding the courage to talk about what happened. by making this account i’m hoping to be able to share my story and find a way to cope and over time heal. i’m also hoping that other people will be able to relate to my journey and we can heal together

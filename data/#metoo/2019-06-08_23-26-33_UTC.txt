Today, I am feeling sadness relating to the sexual trauma I carry from my past-- the unwanted touches and licks, the uncomfortable tingles, and the sensation of helplessness-- frozen in place unable to stop what is happening. ðŸŒ¿
Today, I am sad for every child, young and old, who has endured such an experience. We try to suppress it-- try to forget-- but these strategies are never truly successful. The trauma always makes a home somewhere in our being. ðŸŒ¿
Whether it be in the form of migraines or in the form of tears after loving and desired intimacy, out trauma is constantly attempting to surface, pleading for us to feel the strong emotions tied to its sensations.
ðŸŒ¿
Today, I am feeling sad, and that is OK.

As a midwife’s daughter I have witnessed at least 100 births (including my 3 siblings’) and tended many women in labor as my mother’s apprentice. I know the awesome power of birth and the miracle of giving birth to my own son. I also know the terror of being 16 and pregnant as a result of date rape #metoo. I’ve submitted my body to the doctors and machines that perform painful abortions when I wasn’t ready for motherhood. I have gratitude that our foremothers fought to gain the #righttochoose. Many women have died violently as a result of botched abortions and they continue to die in places where women don’t have access to #womenshealthcare and #safeabortion. #womenrights #ourbodiesourchoice #patriarchalbullshit

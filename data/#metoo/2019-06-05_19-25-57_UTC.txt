I haven't .... but a close friend of mine has. And I feel her pain whenever she speaks about her brothers. 
Please be more conscience of the dialogue you throw around:regarding this extremely realistic matter ! 
Hey, it could be you or a loved one. 
Please check on your strong friends. 💋✌🏾🖤
Remember self care and self checks. 
You may feel alone, but there's many resources out there. 
Last but not least...
Let's get rid of the shame, associated with all kinds of cognitive therapy. 
If you need it, seek it.
I did and y'all haven't seen me YET !  Honey I am here using these platforms to help and to share my journey. 
The air feels better up here.

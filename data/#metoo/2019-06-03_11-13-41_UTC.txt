Some years after #metoo and #TimeIsUp started,there's still some isues that bother me so much.What's the line of an allegation of #SexualAbuse of being just a rumor?
I'm saying it because yesterday surfaced a video of #Neymar(#soccerplayer who briefly dated @ChloeGMoretz and had a long term relationship with #BrazilianModel and actor #BrunaMarquezine)that he #RAPED a woman. 
The same line could be crossed in terms of any other #SexualAbuse but acusing someone by #raping you has more implications that common sense could explain.
It's implied the #rapist himself did a non-consensual coitus with the victmin ,having or not made any act of violence in her body.
For example,#BillCosby FORCED sexual activities by SEDATING women who entered in his stage and did intercourse with them without their consent.Sick!
Despite no "prove" of that happened ,the amount of allegations made the Justice of America investigate the crime.There's a thing called #ForensicPsychology that is scientificly valid to evaluate if this histories are just made up or if the coerence of them can "make a case" reasonable for a trial.Oohh, yes,"Ms Huxtable" did a bad thing.
What i'm saying with that?Before #FeministMovement condem #NeymarJr ,we should realise that there's a criminal and forensic process to determinate if he's guilt of this hedious crime oo if ne is(like he's saying) a victmin of extortion made by this woman.
Sexual abuse can be proved by SCIENTIFIC EXAMS (if they were done very close to the time of the crime).Did she do it?Most of the time,shame and fear make women back up of starting this process(which will make autorities ,following the right justice rituals,to consider that "no one is guilty until proven innocence"_ and believe or not, this is one of the most serious basis of all criminal trials in democratic countries after what happens in #NurembergTrials), so let's wait more for evidencies after judging Neymar's behaviour .
BTW:i'm just quoting #ChloeMoretz and Bruna Marquezine because _as former lovers of this brazilian cellebrity and a #WomenRights activists _they would be the 1st to confirm an abnormal and violent behavour of him.
No word were said.
Let's wait and see.

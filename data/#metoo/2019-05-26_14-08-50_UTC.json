Filters, all. A narrowing, limiting, diluting  and  needlessly controlling of our focus - entirely.\n.\n.\nThe moment that we see feminism as not simply a gender based disparity, racism as not being limited to solely an issue of color, and homophobia as not simply an expression  of aversion to \u201cnon traditional\u201d sexual orientation - and see these all as an overall attitude towards life in general -  that shall be the moment that real change begins. .\n.\nIn the same way we cannot be selectively sustainable with our planet, we cannot and must not limit our conscious awakenings to selective target audiences when we\u2019re all watching the same global channel.\n. .\n.\nThere is no #metoo movement.\nThere is no #blacklivesmatter movement \nThere is no #altright or #altleft movement\nThere is no #sayhername movement .\n.\nThere is only a human movement."

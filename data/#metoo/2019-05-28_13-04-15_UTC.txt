A month ago, @sallygracemindrebo and I met in her childhood dress up room with her mom to record a podcast about gender for @inhumantermspod. I'm honored to be a part of such an important conversation about how celebrating the diversity each of us offers and how dismantling the toxicity in each of us can lead to a conversation worth having. You can search "In Human Terms" on your podcast app, or find it on itunes via the link in my bio. Follow @inhumantermspod for more topics to ruffle your feathers and enlighten the mind.

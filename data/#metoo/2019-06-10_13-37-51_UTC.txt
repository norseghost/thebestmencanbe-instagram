The last day I ever drank alcohol was my wedding day... | Part III

I stood in front the judge, in an orange jumpsuit. “I know who you are,” she said. “You’re the survivor from that rape case. I’m giving you a second chance. I’m dropping the charges. BUT, but...you need to learn to live WITH your pain better.”

…And it hit me in that moment. You see she didn’t say you need to learn to get OVER your pain, or get PAST your pain. She said you need to learn to live WITH your pain.

The 7 years prior flashed before my eyes as I realized that with every step I tried to take away from my pain, I was actually caging myself in even more…slowly becoming a prisoner to it’s destructive aftermath. She was right, like a crumbled piece of paper—my pain would always be a part of my story. There was no straightening out the creases, no erasing them from the canvas. They were there to stay—and it was my choice to let that pain to continue to make me bitter, or make me…better.
.
So for the years following my time in that jail cell, I attempted to make a mends with the pain...and with the world. My through-line became to better the lives of others—even if it was at the expense of myself. My efforts took me from universities in the US to Rape Crisis Centers in Africa to slums in rural India, and beyond. But although finding purpose in my pain gave me a sense of acceptance—in a way I was still burying my pain under the weight of others’ pain. You see I was always second in line for the compassion I gave away. I was constantly prioritizing everyone else before myself.

I carried on in this fashion until it all came to a head, one September night in India—when I was sexually assaulted, for a second time…

What is the status of the safety and dignity of working women in Assam? How high or low is the incidence of sexual harassment of women at the workplace in the state? In recent years global outrage against sexual harassment of women roused by the #MeToo movement and others have exposed its insidious and complex nature, and indicated that concerted efforts are needed to address the issue. Obtaining a clear picture of the ground realities is a crucial first step. There is minimal academic data or reporting on the issue in Assam. This collaborative effort between the Department of Womenâ€™s Studies, Gauhati University, and the North East Network attempts to make a beginning in this respect. Covering employees and employers in both organised and unorganised sectors from seven urban centres across the state, the report seeks to create baseline data that can be used as an advocacy tool by all concerned.

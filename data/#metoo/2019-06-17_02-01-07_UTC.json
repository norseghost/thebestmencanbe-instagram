He understands that sometimes certain things unlock horrible memories for me that I have shoved deep down somewhere.\n..\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t realize I was still sensitive to something like that. I see pictures of bruised faces all the time from the support groups I am in - but there was something about the way that the man in the movie reared his fist back...it was all too real for me.\n..\nSuddenly, I was a scared little girl cowering in the bathroom, peering out of the door jamb, watching my dad deliver blows to my mother\u2019s face. And I remember her face. I remember how cowardly I was, and how hard it was for me to believe my dad had actually done that. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I couldn\u2019t cry then. What if he heard me crying? Would he come after me?\n..\nMaybe today the tears I cried were the ones I needed to cry all those years ago. Maybe if I had cried those tears when I needed to in the first place, I wouldn\u2019t have become calloused and numb and I wouldn\u2019t have continued to choose his side over hers. Yes - I was still a daddy\u2019s girl after that. Can you believe it?\n..\nI was today years old when I took another step in my healing journey in realizing that part of the reason I clung to my abuser was because swallowing my emotions in the moment created cognitive dissonance within my mind. I repeated that practice for many years and it grew worse and worse until he discarded me.\n..\nYou were not created to be physically violated. Anyone who forces their will upon yours and physically violates you is a not only a predator and an abuser, but also a stealer of innocence and hope.\n..\nIf this is you, I am so sorry for what you went through. It is so hard sometimes to walk away from someone you believe loves you, or needs your help. But you should NEVER be someone\u2019s punching bag."

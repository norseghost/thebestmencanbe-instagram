Finally getting a chance to repost this. This has been an unbelievably frustrating time for women and the LGBTQ community. Our basic human rights are being threatened, and I have found myself anxious and sad for this country. .

This is the totally sick teaser trailer for the #metoo horror film I worked on last month. The film is about a girl who goes to a frat party one night, and learns the hard way just how little she matters in this world we live in. Itâ€™s an incredibly important film that I am honored to be apart of. .

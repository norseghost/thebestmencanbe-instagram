I hope this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You’re doing things you’ve never done before, and more importantly, you’re DOING SOMETHING.

So that’s my wish for you, and all of us, and my wish for myself. Make new mistakes. Make glorious, amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody has ever made before. Don’t freeze, don’t stop, don’t worry that it isn’t good enough, or it isn’t perfect, what ever it is: Art, or love, or work or family life. What ever it is you’re scared of doing, do it. Make your mistakes, next year, and forever.

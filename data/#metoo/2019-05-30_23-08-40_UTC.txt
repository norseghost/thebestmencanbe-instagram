Big little lies Season 1 •

This right here is an example of one of the very few times where i’ve found that a show/film was just as good as the book its based on! •

The ‘who done it’ seed is planted in the very first episode and throughout the 7 part series, we learn more and more about the characters’ relationships, their pasts and their present to unravel the beauty of this series. From the very first episode, set in the small town of Monterey California, we’re introduced to so many aspects of the show from suspicion, humour, modern day relationships, family ties..and of course ‘big little lies’! •

The author, #lianemoriarty writes ‘one never truly knows what goes on behind ones semingly perfect life’. There are times when certain scenes are difficult to watch, however bringing these issues to the forefront of our attention is so important as the storyline presents some of the vicious realities of life. Watch how relationship in everyday life form, build and break-down in this gripping drama and prepare yourselves for a shocking series finale! •

With a powerhouse female caste, #reesewitherspoon #shailenewoodley #nicolekidman supported by #zoekravitz and #lauradern playing their roles so well, we’re left so invested and drawn into in each one of their lives, the last episode left viewers like myself hoping for and championing a second season! It really is writing at its very best! •

Catch up with the whole of season 1 on Amazon Prime Video before June 10th, which is when we expect to see season 2 appear on Sky Atlantic and NowTv. It’ll be hard not to binge watch! •

I’m so intrigued to see what Season 2 has in store! And without a book to follow, who knows where they could take it! •

Also, dont forget to check out the soundtrack on spotify! Its 👍🏼! •

Yes!!!! Please!!! Summer vibes with this diffuser blend. Smells so clean and crisp in our home today. Citrus oils are uplifting oils. They help to increase positive vibes. As crazy as that sounds, it’s true. Our sense of smell is linked to the part of the brain that houses our memories and emotions. How amazing is that? Who knew little bottles of oils could have so much power? I’ll be diffusing this all day. What’s in your diffuser? .

Because this topic is very close to my heart — Last week, Smile Charity, a non-profit org. led by my dear friend @anipahm1912 came to Tà Long village in Quảng Trị, Vietnam and provided a wonderful educational summit called “Kids Safety Guide” to the children here. 💪🏾Throughout the program, the students learned how to recognize inappropriate behaviors, how to respond to them while remaining safe, and how to report/ escalate. 😉 💪🏾 🤛👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾😔50% of the residents in Ta Long village live below the poverty line and the young kids here are vulnerable to predators. 🤮🤢I, myself, am a survivor and I support this effort wholeheartedly. The Light from Within and Smile Charity will put our heads together for another similar program coming in September. We will “target” the young folks in Trà Vinh. If you are in Vietnam and would like to volunteer your time, please contact Anita or via Facebook at “ smilecharity” - Photo credits @anipahm1912

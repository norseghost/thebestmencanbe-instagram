A shout out to the art students at Watsonville High School - I appreciate them sharing their thoughts, ideas and personal stories with me as they reflected on The “AND” Series. Their were several students who shared their desire for women to be treated equally and with respect in this country.  They also said they would like to see more women in elected offices!

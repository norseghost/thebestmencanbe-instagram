Dear Mr. 3AM Chancer. 
Little boy lost. Mumma didnâ€™t raise you, right? Clearly. Cos youâ€™re not that bright. 
Itâ€™s doubtful this response will ever reach you. Not that itâ€™s my plight to teach you anything. I really havenâ€™t the time. But a little rhyme might help me to find some reason?

Big man games. In your little man britches. Delusions of bitches cementing your status. Well this particular bitch is taking one big hiatus 
and thus is writing to formally, 
implore thee, 
to take nose from arse and 
bark up a different fucking tree. 
At 3am and all the hours in between. You know exactly what I mean. In fact you should probably leave the whole friggin Forrest. 
Because if Iâ€™m honest you havenâ€™t got a clue of the dangers that await when you poke at snake with stick. Thinking you might have a special kind of dick. 
On your head perhaps. But there are plenty of chaps in that brigade. Each with egos as jaded as yours. This shit starts wars and yours is with self. 
And Itâ€™s not good for your health. Not to mention ugly as sin. Where the toxins begin and poisons within and a medicine as Divine as mine is just not on your menu.

So go sing for your supper. Scupper along.  I trust that Life will show you right from wrong, but Iâ€™m not about to sing that song for you. 
Nor do I wish to destroy you. Nor put you on blast. Tear down your barriers as fast as you tried to break down mine. No chance mate. Not this time. 
Respectfully I decline.

The war is no longer mine. 
No chance mate. Not this time. ðŸŽ¬ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ¤ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ¬ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ¤ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ¬ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ¤ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ¬ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ¤ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ¬ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ¤ðŸ’¥ #SpokenwordUK #poetsuk #poetrybedfordshire #artistsandcreatives #SoulFoodPoetry #poetryinprogress #visualarts #poetrytroupeuk #internationalpoetry #poetsofficial #poeticunion #ukpoetrytroupe #IGTVCreator #Slc84 #Vintagevideos #verrt #poetry #metoo #empoweredwomen #toxicmasculinity

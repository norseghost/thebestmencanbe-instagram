Yesterday my therapist went over “emotional blackmail” and how to get out of toxic relationships, even when they’re close friends or family. I know I’ve got to cut off some people who are very close to me because the relationships aren’t healthy, but I’m so stressed and nervous about all of it. @target trips make everything better, but even after my therapy and retail therapy, I’m in need of some advice! Anybody have any tips on how to cut off toxic people? Or how to maybe even repair those relationships? I will for real appreciate each piece of advice you’ve got to give! Comment or DM me 🙏🏼

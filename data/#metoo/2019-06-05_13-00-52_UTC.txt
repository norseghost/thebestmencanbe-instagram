Did you know that empowering the bystander to respond is one of the best ways to stop sexual harassment in the workplace? It’s so important to facilitate a safe & respectful working environment and company culture. I’m happy that so many companies are hiring me for sexual harassment trainings and I’m excited to conduct nearly 30 in the coming months. My favorite part is the group exercise—it facilitates so much discussion and learning, especially in this #MeToo era. #mentalhealth #sexualharassment #workplace #training #respect #corporate #speaker #keynote #joycemarter #mentalwealth #karmickindness

it's chilling to learn of just how many woman have been sexually assaulted. womxn close to me. and womxn across the world.
.
.
i am one of them. .
.
it pains me to think of the countless numbers of boys and men who have been violated in this way.
.
.
rape, against anyone, is unjust. .
.
the other day I read something someone wrote and it said: 'rape is worse than death'. that struck me and it got me thinking more deeply about rape and the effects it has on ones soul, psyche, sense of self worth, consciousness and the lens through which we view the world.

i have the very precious assignment of being conduit and space holder for the beings who sit across from me in the sacred contract of finding healing together. its an honour and blessing. for a long time, this responsibility scared me (it still does), and i held back because something about it felt too big, and I questioned whether i really was the person for the job and whether i had the capacity to handle another's heart. .
.
i don't know how many times i have broken. i broke many times as i young adult, though i didnt know that this is in fact what i was experiencing. i numbed myself in various ways and only understood and acknowledged what i was doing many years in. i self sabbotaged. i poisoned myself with unhealthy foods, alcohol, negative self talk, and by betraying myself by allowing others to betray and subjugate me. by accepting what i didnt deserve and in not keeping the promises i made to myself. 
i've lost count of the number of times i've broken my own heart. .
.
my reflections over the past few weeks, are showing me three things as it becomes obvious that what is being communicated is more than mere thoughts. 
one - this is coming back up to the surface because i have not completely dealt with and healed from my own trauma. i accept that this journey my never leave me entirely, but my perspective is continously changing and easing. 
two - im being guided towards one of the focuses of my practice and being shown where our healing is needed. .

Scroll ▶️▶️▶️ for a story of why we need feminism and women specific support & allies in 2019. 
The first of these photos is me excited for a night out with friends - and second is the look of someone, only hours later, who was just followed and physically grabbed / assaulted literally minutes ago walking home from the bus stop, and subsequently had a panic episode. 
And some of y’all wonder why we’re frightened when men walk alone behind or into our path? 
No matter what we wear, we shouldn’t fear walking 4 minutes alone when it’s getting light outside just because I am an decides he’s entitled to take something that isn’t his. I was no doubt targeted because I ‘look’ drunk all the time when I walk with my CP.  In the early morning hours maybe this arsehole thought I was a drunken easy target.  The moment I screamed and shouted at him, he ran away almost as fast as he appeared.  This is one of the masses of reasons why feminism is so needed in 2019.  We deserve to feel safe enough to walk alone at sunrise. 
Stay safe, sisters. ♥️ Scary how many people have already heard what happened to me and said #MeToo.

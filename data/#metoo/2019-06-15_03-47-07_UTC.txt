This bracelet represents The Love Necklace Campaign just like the original necklace design... Available in 14k goldfill or sterling silver, you choose which metal you want, which women’s shelter you’d like the one-for-one Love Necklace to go to, and wear it with love, and confidence, that you’ve made a profound impact on a woman’s journey toward health, safety, and dignity.❤️click the link in my bio to join The Love Necklace Campaign Community#love #community #womenempowerment #metoo .

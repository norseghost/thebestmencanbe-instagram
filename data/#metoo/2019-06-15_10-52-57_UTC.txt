Two feelings are forcing us to act like we do. 
1) 𝗳𝗲𝗮𝗿, we struggle for security and we are afraid of everything unknown. 🙀
Thomas Hobbes claimed that this fear is the constant human nature, we are born to fight in order to survive.
⠀
2) 𝗵𝗼𝗽𝗲, and that comes back to religion. 🙏 People need something to believe in, something what is better than reality. Disney industry is strong, but first misfortune in love💔 and that uncomplicated world is ruined.
⠀
Religions give many more answers on complicated questions, they don't show an ideal life, they touch our very secular, deep parts of heart, which break during the life. Death, family, moral standards, am I good, am I right?👁️‍🗨️
⠀
One of the things that connects those two feelings in one,  is a 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘄𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘁𝘆, which is undoubtedly connected to these or that religion.

In Ukraine dominant is Christian orthodox church ✝️:
When a wibe is entering the church⛪ she has to put a head cover, this tradition comes back to 𝟭 𝗔𝗗, when 𝗣𝗮𝘂𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗔𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘁el 𝗰𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝘁𝗼 Corinth. 𝗛𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 ..𝗮 𝗖𝗵𝗿𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗻 𝘄𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗻 has to cover her hair as far as since antic times they represented the brightest attribute of femine beauty and that would be a symbol of women's humility towards her husband as a head over herself.(1Cor.11:3) 👰🤵
⠀⠀If a woman wouldn't cover her hair, she had to cut them as far she is fallen women and harlot.(1Cor.11:6) 🙊
⠀
Though, because of loss of many canonical traditions in years of Soviet Union, when church was forbidden, nowadays even girls of 3 y.o.👧 are supposed to cover their head when visiting cathedral, also some people believe that girls in puberty have to cover head as far as because of menstruation they are no more "clean".😶🧐💩

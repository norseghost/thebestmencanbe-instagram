I know it's been a few days, but we are still pissed about how this country treats abortion & religion. 
I know it's been a few months, but we are still pissed about how this country treats sexual assault.
I know it's been a few years, but we are still pissed about how this country prosecutes rape.
I know it's been almost a century since we got voting rights, but we are still pissed about how this country treats women as sex objects and vessels for procreation, rather than humans.

I know all of this shit has been happening every damn day, not just with high profile cases like Alabama, Bret Kavanaugh, Bill Cosby, and Brock Turner.

Some asked what I was doing on my story with barbies and scissors... I was making a construct project for my studio photography class. Not my strongest work or category of photography, but I still did it. 
I don't know about other women, but this is how the state of America has had me feeling the last few years. Surrounded by more Cosby's than Ashton Kutchers, vulnerable, and bound with no way to do anything. All we have is our voices to speak our truth until people start listening.

Open your ears, we can't speak out any louder; we might get called psychotic.

How has all this media against women's rights been impacting you?

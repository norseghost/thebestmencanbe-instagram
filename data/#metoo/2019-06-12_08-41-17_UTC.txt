Bollocks to THE SHAME OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND FAMILY BETRAYAL: Now I embrace who I am. I am powerful. I always was. I had just forgotten.

Before the age of ten I’d tried to hang myself. I just wanted the hurt and pain to stop. I didn’t want to be the kid who cried every day at school because they didn’t want to go home. - Danielle’s Story

The Bollocks: As a child I experienced sexual abuse at the hands of multiple perpetrators. I grew up feeling dirty, confused, expecting every man I met to abuse me. Key figures in my family unit were absent and I lived in a home where violence was the norm and my step mother detested me. My self-worth and self-esteem were at rock bottom.

Since then: It was powerful: I cannot deny what I was feeling that day and have felt every day since. I felt an energy flowing through my veins. It surrounded my soul and I felt taller. I felt stronger, as if I could fly. My ability was unlimited. It was formidable. I made a conscious decision to allow my light to shine, brighter than the darkness of my past and the dark forces that sought to do me emotional harm. And I was powerful. I am powerful. I was always powerful. I had just forgotten.

Our book is a collection of real-life stories told by real-life people who’ve chosen to shine a light on what it means to break free from modern-day struggles that are common in our society. “B.O.L.L.O.C.K.S. to That, I Choose to Shine!” All proceeds from the book go to our pro-bono fund so we can take DNA Light Up to the people and places who would not normally have the means to access this kind of work.

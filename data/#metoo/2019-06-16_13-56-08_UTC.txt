If you were EVER a child in America (or western culture) AND/OR a parent - you will want to listen to this to free yourself from much guilt and more!🔥👊💥🙏 Maybe your childhood wasn’t as bad or as damaging as you have thot it was.  Maybe it is just the prevailing #myth of our #culture that tells us #childhood should be magical, beyond special and give you all you desire beyond your wildest dreams.  Oh and that childhood is the BEST part of life (meaning it is all downhill from then on!). When we subconscious and collectively believe that, we arrive into adulthood a little more than pissed off that we “didn’t get what we needed” as children.  We blame our parents and feel we have so much to “heal” that we can never be happy, healthy and whole. (If this is true than as an orphan myself I would still be rolling around in my miserable childhood!) As parents, this myth leaves us feeling guilty or maybe even ashamed - as well as exhausted attempting to ensure our kids never feel anything but happiness at being alive as kids. (Not to mention creating self entitled kids that don’t grow out of narcissism.) Y’all this is NOT WHAT CHILDHOOD IS ABOUT.  Childhood is about growing out of our narcissism, learning it is a big world full of other people, and gaining the emotional tools we will need to navigate a world beyond black and white. 
Listen in on why I feel this prevailing subconscious myth is so damaging to us as individuals and as a culture.  Then make your choice as to what you wish to believe. 
Thanks to Caroline Myss for waking me up from this myth!

This isn’t even just about being fat ... I look in the mirror and I hate what I see ... literally from my head to my toes ... when I’m out the house I try and hide in baggy clothes, black clothes, avoid social events, avoid the camera, fad diets again and again, piercings, tattoo’s, I try all sorts to either hide or change my appearance. I realised no matter what changes I made to my appearance, none of them would help. The problem is in my head. The problem is how I view myself. How hard I am on myself. So I found yoga. I found my body could be really cool. I found improvements in just a few weeks in how my body could move and it got stronger too. That made me feel good. My mind started to change a little, only a little, but the change was there. But. There’s always a But with me. I then saw pictures of me at a recent event and my heart sank because yet again everything I saw disgusted me. Normally that would stop me in my tracks and I’d give up on whatever new fad was making me feel a little better. I WONT GIVE UP THIS TIME. I know yoga is helping me and I know I need to keep working. This may have been a step back but I’ll stand up and take another step forward. Because I’m not disgusting, my brain just makes me think I am. Well fuck you brain! I’m worthy of self love and if I have to fight really fucking hard for it then I will! .

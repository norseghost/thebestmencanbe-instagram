#HerNetwork | The Federal Ministry of Women Affairs through the National Centre for Women Development has promised to induct some Nigerian great women like #KudiratAbiola,  #DrStellaAdadevoh into the Nigerian Women Hall of Fame.

The NCWD Director-General, Mary Ekpere-Eta said "The hall will provide role models for younger girls and society at large. The criteria for selection are first woman, historic or living to achieve recognition in a field of endeavour; a significant statewide contribution to arts, athletics, business, government, philanthropy, humanities, science and education.” According to the NCWD, the induction will take place every four years to ensure that no woman deserving is left behind.

Dr. Adadevoh, who died in August 2014, was a Nigerian doctor who helped to curb the spread of the Ebola virus by ensuring that a Liberian patient, Patrick Sawyer, remained in quarantine despite pressure from his country.

Kudirat was assassinated on June 9, 1996, during the heat of the June 12 struggle for democratic freedom in Nigeria.

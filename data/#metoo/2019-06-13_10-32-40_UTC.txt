Some of the most comforting words are "me too." The moment when you find out your struggle is also someone else's struggle, that you are not alone, and others have been down the same road. 
Never feel that you are alone, if you're in a place that's dark and you feel lost, alone, and afraid.. I'm here. I'm with you. I'll fight for you. No one should have to walk their path alone. I support you.

ROMAN POLANSKI
Roman Polanski was arrested and charged with raping 13-year-old Samantha Geimer and fled the country upon learning that he was likely to face imprisonment and deportation.

Our dearest friend Quentin Tarantino has been defending him. Tarantino doesnâ€™t believe it was rape because Polanski only had sex with a minor and that is not rape. Also the victim was a party girl who was down for the party. He also found it PRETTY COOL that Polanski still won an academy award. AMAZING!

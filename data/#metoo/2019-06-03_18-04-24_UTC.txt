Who said being over 45 is old? Wherrrrrrrr???
👊😚☝️ That's called "heavenly glow up"! And before you say it...took me 3 decades to love the skin I'm in, flaws and all...confidence in Christ will BLOW UP shame and low self-esteem. I was 335lbs and after losing over 100lbs I found I still carried body shame. It's not the outward change but the inward change that builds your glow! Reading your Bible is more healing than the choicest of vitamins or veggies. APPLYING the word of God is more beautifying than any skin care regime! .

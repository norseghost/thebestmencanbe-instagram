I Can't be Both: An Art-Based Reflective Inquiry into the duality of being both, a survivor and perpetrator in one body.
:
Happy to share that this trauma therapy project I've been presenting as a series of narrative poetry and art presentations on the cycle of sexual violence has been invited to a few clinical institutional spaces in India and in North America. I will be sharing as I begin going on tour with this work ðŸ’— (need all your love and luck)

The intention behind the work is: -  to allow other therapists and social workers to access complicated issues of incestual violence, childhood sexual abuse and the impact of sexual violence on the brain in relationships, using the power of the arts. :
:
-to ask clinicians to not view sexual violence as good versus bad or black versus white, and to create better services for people who want to access change after perpetration. :
I'm excited that folks want to have this conversation publicly and access tools to deal with this sexual violence epidemic we are seeing.

More updates soon!

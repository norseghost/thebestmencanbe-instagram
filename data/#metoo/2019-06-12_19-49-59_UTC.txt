‚Å£I FORGIVE my rapist.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Why? NOT because his actions are forgive-able..‚†Ä
‚†Ä
I forgive him because he got to take SO much from me. He doesn‚Äôt get to take anything else, especially not my peace of mind.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
I will NEVER know how HE sleeps at night‚†Ä
But I forgive him, I have moved on the best I can.‚†Ä
And I sleep just fine. ‚ù§Ô∏è

•• C O D E P E N D E N T •• Relationships 
#Advocate #Idaho ————————————————————————
Codependent relationships can be harmful. They can are harmful or toxic because often such relationships are one-sided and emotionally destructive or abusive. Codependency is sometimes referred to as “relationship addiction.”
Acknowledging signs of codependency is an important step in striving towards a healthier relationship that is mutually satisfying.

#TBT Vigdís Finnbogadóttir served as the fourth President of Iceland from 1980 to 1996. She was the world's first democratically directly elected female President. With a presidency of exactly sixteen years, she is the longest-serving elected female Head of State of any country to date. She also remains Iceland's only woman President to date. Before her, the first woman to serve as President was Isabel Martínez de Perón of Argentina, who as Vice-President ascended to the presidency in 1974 after the death of her husband, President Juan Perón.

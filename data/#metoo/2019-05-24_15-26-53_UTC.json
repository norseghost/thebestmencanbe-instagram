                        "text": "#fridayfeels part 1 Going to tell you a story that might be interesting to some, and fall on deaf ears to others.\n\nI always joke that my nieces and nephews (12 of them) keep me young, but I had a recent conversation that made me realize just how much...... The world has changed so much in the past 20 years, but people (women) like me have been fighting an uphill battle just to be viewed and treated as equals to our male counterparts. (Yes, really)\n\nThis has created a kind of callous in me to all of the buzzwords your hear today: misogyny (what?), sexism (where?), equality (who?), even feminism (wtf?) and sexual transgression (???) have become meh occurrences. Just keep pushing forward.... One night a few months ago, my strong, outspoken, activist niece (@julia.faouaz) and I were having dinner, discussing all of these hot topics, and I explained my views of how it\u2019s only been 100 years that women have been able to house themselves, feed themselves, and be self-sufficient #sapiens (read it \ud83d\udcaf) This can explain this uphill battle of working twice as hard, giving twice as much, and maybe, just maybe, we get somewhere near the recognition we deserve, without having to deal with the aforementioned aggressions.\n\nAfter some healthy debate and discussion, what I was doing that evening was discouraging my niece from her passion of advocating for women and minority rights, based on my own experiences and my real exhaustion of dealing with the above. I love my life but it can be tiring at times. Didn\u2019t think it was a big deal at the time, but let me dive in..... A little self-analysis was next:\n\nDo I ignore these issues? NO\nDo I speak up in defence of myself and others? YES\nBut I was tired, it is very tiring to constantly be defending your position, your assertiveness, your success, your independence....see next post for more \ud83d\udc49\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#womensrights #reflection #feminism\n#empowereachother\n#ifitdoesntkillyou #nofucks #sorrynotsorry\n#nomeansno #endrapeculture\n#misogyny\n#equality\n#equalrightsforall\n#metoo #stopvictimblaming\n#abundancemindset #growthmindset\n#webstagram\n#selfie #natural #naturallight"

I never had a father growing up. To watch the love of a father for this daughter warms my heart so much.
💫
Daughter’s need beautiful, kind, respectful men in their life. When they don’t have them, they will look for a father’s love in ways never designed for them as they grow up.
💫
For me, it wasn’t until I met my husband, who showed me that a beautiful and pure love from a father is possible for his daughter.
💫
Thank you @brad.toews @b-rad, for because of you, the hearts and lives of two daughters on this planet have been changed forever. 🙏
💫
For those who this hasn’t been possible for you or your daughter, teach the girl within that pure and fullness of love is found within her. Teach her awareness. Teach her forgiveness. Then teach her that everything she needs is found by falling inward.

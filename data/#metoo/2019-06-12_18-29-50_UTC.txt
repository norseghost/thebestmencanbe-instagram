Daddy.
Today I’m painting for my Dad.
...who I don’t get to have a relationship with because of my narc mom.
💔
It’s only been 9-months since I’ve gone #nocontact with my narcissistic mother. But with that comes not having anything to do with anyone that I’m blood-related to. She took that away from me...either because she comes with them or because she has involved them in her #smearcampaign. Sure I miss some family members, but I miss Daddy the most. I wonder if he misses me...

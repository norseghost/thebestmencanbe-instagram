PE Treatment was helpful getting me outta my house with the homework, but having to repeat my rape store over and over was torture. Did my first session of EMDR and itâ€™s going well. I love the Steven A. Cohen Military Family Clinic at Cape Fear Valley. They have a very caring atmosphere. #ellbesdailystruggles #ellbe84 #ellbe #battlingdepression #strongerthaniappear #livingwithptsd #ptsd #sexualassault #mst #rape #militarysexualtrauma #survivor #domesticviolence #molestation #sexualabuseadvocate #neveragain #metoo #victimnomore #awareness #mentalhealthawareness #endrapeculture

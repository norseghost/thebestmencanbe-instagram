#tbt tfw the photographer asks you to cuddle after the shoot 📸❌ times up bitch. #timesup *** read below for warning***
I wasn’t going to put him on blast but I don’t want other women comics to have to deal with this gross bullshit. Before the shoot I asked him how much it would be and he said, “no, don’t worry about it” and then after the shoot asked me to cuddle a few times. I said no a few times. This man is married and has three kids. I doubt he’s in an open marriage. I was afraid to make a thing of it and have years of #metoo stories so I agreed to grab a bite with him. While eating tacos he showed me pictures of his children. Yuck. There are so many phenomenal photographers who won’t take advantage of your kindness, ambition, and want to “cuddle” with you for payment. And if they decide not to charge you you don’t owe them anything. Anyway, his name is Eric Johnson. Don’t shoot with him. He’s talented but not THAT talented. #timesup #doubleglasses #doubleanger pink hair by @hazelhair11 💅🏼🌸 #witch #🔥 #metoo #dontfuckwithme

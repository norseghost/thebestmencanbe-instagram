@redcircleproject thank you for this. Yes yes yes! ðŸŒˆ we need more of this message. 2 spirit people were seen as sacred and leaders of the community before colonial violence. The erasure of 2 spirited people & the forced enactment of patriarchy, homophobia, and transphobia is all colonial process & the impact is still ongoing. We must work with our 2 spirited folks to end this injustice as they are Loved, they are Sacred and they BELONG ! ðŸŒ¿âœ¨

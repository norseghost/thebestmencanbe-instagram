Despite being bombarded with praise and abuse earlier this year after it launched an advertising campaign inspired by the #MeToo movement, promoting positive masculinity, Gillette still didn't stop wanting to play a part in creating change. ‚Å£

A transgender man learning to shave is featured in a new ad by the razor company Gillette. It has been viewed more than a million times and amassed a supportive reaction, including from other trans men who found it extremely relatable. ‚Å£

P&G (Procter and gamble) has always set a high bar when it comes to engaging the audience through conscience advertising! Not only has it helped them make profit but also let them be one of the best when it comes to being socially responsible! ‚Å£

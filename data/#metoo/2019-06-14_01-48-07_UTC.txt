I used to be embarrassed by my stories, where I came from, the addicts who showed me what kind of love I’d search for in everyone else. 
Everything that tore me apart I deserved, after-all it was who I was born to be. 
Now, I know my stories aren’t tragic they are inspirational. Not only did I survive, I keep climbing, breaking cycles and find love within for myself. The kind that rocks everything else.

Don’t be ashamed of your struggle, if you’re brave enough to share it, you might help someone through, sometimes that person just needed to hear, “You’re not alone, I’ve got you.”

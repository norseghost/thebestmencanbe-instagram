Real question: what order does your family get their food? For me it’s just get your own food so I mean I don’t know. I think it’s ok that some women take up the housewife postition where they take care of the kids while the husband works, that’s pretty cool. But it’s not cool that some people think that’s required. Like just do what makes you happy. Thanks.

It’s still an active investigation, so we aren’t ascribing innocence or guilt. We are simply reminding you that you need to monitor your kids in religious spaces just like you do in any other environment. Predators do not discriminate; they molest in and out of the church. If there is an opportunity to abuse a child, they will take it. In fact, they rely on your desire to see the good in others in the church, especially leaders, to take advantage of their victims. #childsexabuseawareness #stopchildsexabuse #childsexabusesurvivor #parentsofchilldsexabusesurvivor #sexualassault #endchildsexabuse #endrapeculture #childabuse #sextrafficking #atlanta #ATL #Georgia #church #girls #teens #awareness #rapevictim #victim #children #prevention #trafficking  #survivor #tips #blogger #speaker #metoo #advocate #volunteer  #socialmedia article: rollingout

If you didn’t know ready I 💘 barre by @ellyasam 😌 my go to staple class that I only miss if she isn’t in town 🤣(which is v rare yay🌝) Barre has been one of the main reasons I feel super strong, why I keep returning to BLOK + why I’m happier than ever in the body I have today. So - very thankful. ❤️ photos by the wonderful @maxoppenheim at the @freesoulsistas event @bloklondon

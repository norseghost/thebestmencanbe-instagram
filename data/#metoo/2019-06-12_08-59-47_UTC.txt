Move. You were born to move. From the very second you entered this earth you were born to move. Before you could talk, you cried; before you could walk, you crawled.
Wild and curious, you grew and explored the world around you.
Exercise. Exercise your body, your rights of freedom, your right to explore, grow and be happy.
The ability to run, to cycle, to jump or to climb is due to the ownership of the greatest device one can ever own. Your body is the most valuable piece of equipment you will ever have the privilege to operate, a privilege that is fully denied to many others. So make the most of your mobility and feel the power of your existence as you tread the earth’s vibrant soil and run through space and time, make the most of your mobility and move.
And keep moving. Don’t let your movement decrease, ever. Stay hungry, stay wild.
Your movement is the exercise of your life, your process of being conscious, alive and a part of this universe. It’s what represents and quantifies your existence in this moment right here, right now. Never let your life slow down to the point where you are sitting still and killing time, not while you have the ability to run, fly and soar into the space around you. ***

“Our bodies remember every one of our life experiences--joyful experiences like the exhilaration of jumping on the trampoline, or the excitement of a first kiss. However, they also remember the less joyful times - the feeling of being bullied at school, the trauma of a car crash, grief over a death in the family or the loss of a loved one. 
In an ideal world, when trauma or deep feelings affect us, we experience and assimilate those feelings, and then discharge and release the energy. However, often we don't fully accept or deal with our inner responses at the time--sometimes we suppress and block the flow of energy and bury the memory and the feelings. The vibration of the trauma then becomes embedded into our bodies and woven into our muscles, joints, and organs. These blocked feelings of guilt, shame, pain, and fear become the tensions in our bodies, the illnesses and diseases we don't understand. 
Releasing blocked energy from our bodies is a vital part of cultivating good health and wellbeing. We might work with therapists or healers, or do whatever inner work we are drawn to do, to understand and process our feelings and experiences. But discharging the holding from our bodies is a vital step in the process that is very often overlooked.”

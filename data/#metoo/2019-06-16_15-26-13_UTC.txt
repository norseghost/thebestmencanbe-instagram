It was a Sunday that day. â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
I found myself sitting on a rock, looking steadily and intently at the Pangong Lake. From Carolina blue to Turquoise blue, the lake kept changing its colour. Every inch in my body was aching as this was also the day I ran Ladakh Marathon. One of the world's toughest and highest marathon, starting at an altitude of c.12,000 ft above sea level, charting a course through the most beautiful landscape.
â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €
It was a pleasure running in the thin air of Ladakh! And it was a pleasure to sit back in admiration of the Pangong Lake. â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €
A Sunday like this one is all Iâ€™m hoping for in life.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €
So cheers for this one and many more it come! â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €

I just found this note right now when I was cleaning out a drawer. I remember writing this back at a time when I didn’t like or love myself and I was suffering. I had this stuck on a mirror so I could tell myself this over and over until I could finally learn to love myself. I use to be suffering everyday. Somebody’s choice to sexually abuse me took over my life for years. I use to think it was my fault, we use to be taught how assault was somehow always the victims fault. WELL GUESS WHAT IT’S NOT MY FAULT AND IT NEVER WAS MY FAULT AND I LOVE MYSELF MORE THAN I EVER DID BEFORE. #metoo #follow #followme #followtrain #loveyourself  #lovemyself #theofficialstina #transgender #transwoman #survivor #transpride #iloveme #artistsoninstagram #artist #singersongwriter #truth #loveformyself #strength #courage #positive #positivity #change #forgiveness #respect #respectme #respectvictims

Ever feel like this?

Lately, and for a few years now I’ve felt this rising energy in me that I just can’t deny anymore.

At first it scared me~ and now with some personal investigation and reflection on habits formed from my past I’m clear about what’s up: Life itself, the primal essence of power and potency within us all is trying to express itself fully through me & I’m aware I’ve been stopping it up, holding back, dimming my light, my feelings, my joy, my pleasure, beauty anger..all of it!!!.. out of fear of displeasing or harming another.

Where did I learn this? 
And why are we not taught how to honor all parts of ourselves as women and as humans in general? Huh?!!! No wonder a big part of me is pissed off! And I know I’m not alone ~ can I get an amen? Or better yet an #awomen ?! Catch me sharing some of these discoveries and personal stories + new songs at this weekend’s #toomuchwoman Conference in #sf

Part 2: ... The Me Too movement tends to get a lot of flack from certain people, but this experience is what I believe to be the heart of it. It is women coming together to say, “I see you,” “I understand because I’ve lived it also,” “you are not alone,” “ I believe you”. It’s not about making women more important than men. It’s about making victims important. The bond that I have with these amazing women is empowering. I am lucky to know them. Because of their strength I can now officially say that my daughter is safe from witnessing extreme violence and eventually becoming a victim herself. Thank you to everyone who has been rooting for us during this time. I truly appreciate all the strength and support we have received during this time. Because of this experience we will also have the opportunity to speak directly to other women on the topic of domestic violence and continue to make a difference in the lives of other women. If there is anyone out there who is living their own Hell, please reach out. These stories need to be shared and heard. Click on the link in my bio to read the article written by Alyssa Lauer. .

I actually quit coffee a few months ago just because I do not like being addicted to anything. It was no fun but I did it. Then my mornings were kinda off because I did not know what to drink in lieu of it. 😂 I don’t usually eat breakfast so a cup of joe was my thing. Well I went back to a cup a day but it is nice to know I can quit if I choose to do so. 😊 Do you have a habit you would like to break? 
PS. Chalkboard Tray is selling right now for $3  @target i just put some feet on them 😬•

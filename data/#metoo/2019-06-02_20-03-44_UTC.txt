Banning abortion doesn’t get rid of abortion. It will just get rid of safe abortion. Pregnant people will start shoving hangers up their bodies and drinking poison again. This will not also harm the pregnant person, but also the “baby.” It’s not so “prolife” to not give a shit about the pregnant person.

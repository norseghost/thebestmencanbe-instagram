So many incredibly women celebrating life, evolution and growth. Most importantly they are taking #powerfulsteps and I feel honoured to be sharing that journey with them. 
One of the non-negotiable follow ups to our workshops is accountability and a strong framework for who is going to support you in your forward journey. I loved people really thinking about their family, friends and professional tribes as this is who will keep you on track. No one should be afraid to @mariekondo what does not align with their journey out of their lives. 
Thankyou @jacintatynan for your incredibly kind words 🦋🙏🦋

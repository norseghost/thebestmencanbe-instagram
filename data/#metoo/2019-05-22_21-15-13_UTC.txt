Have you ordered your No More 1 in 4 Younique FoundationT-shirt yet? (Link below) 😍

I am asking that anyone who is planning on supporting Reclaim Hope and I during the Kentucky Extreme Mustang Makeover next month (June 21-22) to please make this purchase for this extremely important to me cause.

100% of every dollar goes towards supporting Survivor Women who have been sexually abused as children and adolescents. 
Please bring and wear your shirts Saturday night of the finals!

Thank you so much!!! ❤❤❤ There are mens shirts too in this style so dont feel leftf out 😂😘 #2019KentuckyExtremeMustangMakeover #ReclaimHope

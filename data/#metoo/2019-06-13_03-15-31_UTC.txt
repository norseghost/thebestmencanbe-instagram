You know the stuff that keeps me from forgiving, the hurt, the betrayal, the walls I built, the nasty stuff I've so masterfully learned to hide, You know the stuff that cut me soooooo deep that it still bleeds when I think about it ...that stuff God, heal that 🙌🏾 #myprayer #ineedgod #healme #whentheyseeus #godeep

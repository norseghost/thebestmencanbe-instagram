                        "text": "I remember the time I struggled to get sober.  Having to let go of my best friend, the bottle of grey goose, was tough because that meant I had to face my feelings with no filter.  I sought help through individual & group therapy. 9 years later,  I still have a lot of feelings but I don\u2019t need to reach for my \u201cbest friend\u201d to mask them.* I remember the time when I struggled to leave an abusive marriage.  I don\u2019t want to rehash just to tell you how tough it was to let go of the home I built with the man I love and our kids (We had 7 dogs and 3 cats). And yet, I also sought help through individual and group therapy at that time. A few years have passed, and  though I still experience a lot of heartache (Trauma is a real bitch), I\u2019m not looking to another human being to save me anymore.  I am my own Savior.* What these breakdowns / breakthroughs in my past have taught me is that SEEKING HELP is one of the best things I c ould\u2019ve ever done for myself.  THERE IS NO SHAME I SEEKING HELP. Truth is many people die from staying silent because of shame. For me, seeking help became a matter of life and death. My alcoholism was killing me slowly, so I had to ask myself: Do I want to live or die? To make the choice to live meant I had to SEEK HELP.  I went to an outpatient rehab, joined recovery groups and got therapy.  When I had difficulty leaving my marriage, I had to ask myself again: Do I want to live or die? To make the choice to live at that point also meant I had to SEEK HELP again. @peaceovrviolnce was truly instrumental in helping me save myself.  With this said, I encourage anyone (well- everyone!) to seek help for whatever struggles you\u2019re going through & make the choice to live.* My latest film, SHEVOLUTION, tells the story not unlike my own.  It takes an unfiltered look at the life of a domestic abuse survivor who struggles with PTSD as she tries to navigate a life in recovery.

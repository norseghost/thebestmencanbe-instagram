How is this guy Adrian Griffin still in the league? He has had sexual relationships with teenaged ball girls! I’m a friend of a young lady, who I’m in full support of in coming out about this.  She was a teen when he was a coach for the bucks & started this affair. A teen!! Was this background information disclosed when considering him for another coaching job? How is he still able to work in this same environment to take advantage of young girls? How many more girls has this happened to? Is this the assurance and comfort teams look for to hire? I told her to come out before, but now it’s imperative, as her statue of limitations is not even close to being up.  Because it seems there is nothing to protect these young girls from being taken advantage of. Is this what the Raptors support is this who the Memphis Grizzlies will support? @raptors @memgrizz @__rjp__ @ramatu_ujiri @nba @bucks

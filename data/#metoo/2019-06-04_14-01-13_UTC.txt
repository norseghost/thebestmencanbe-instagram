The essential account of R. Kelly's actions and their consequences.⠀
⠀
'If not for Jim DeRogatis, singer R. Kelly would still be selling out arenas, and the women who accuse the signer of sexual and physical assault would still be unheard. No one has followed their harrowing stories longer than DeRogatis, a mensch and one hell of a reporter. Soulless is an astonishing document of journalistic doggedness, and one man's decades-long pursuit of justice and truth' - Renee Graham, Boston Globe opinion columnist⠀

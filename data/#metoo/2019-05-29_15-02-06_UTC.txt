Second day of the Dahab Apnea Competition. Another beautiful dive and a new Aida National Record for Ecuador 🇪🇨 in the discipline CTWB to a depth of 55 meters, breaking  my previous record from yesterday .  The best organization one  can ever dream of helped without a doubt , my good mindset before the attempt.
I was so happy  to have Florian Burghart as a competition Coach, “la classe”, supportive and caring.
This dive is dedicated to my loves Ophelia, Elleanor and my Queen Alenka : You definitely made my day! Thank you💙 #mujer #agua #ecuador #nationalrecord #molchanovs #waoraniresistance #metoo

This year I was lucky enough to illustrate for the 2019 edition of #Dicta, the annual UoB Law Club magazine!! .

Dicta has articles on topics from refugees, immigration, Trump, divorce, rape as a war weapon, to terrorism, #MeToo, covert policing and many more.

The article I drew for was on the infringement of Hong Kong's sovereignty by China's ever harsher efforts to curb the city's political independence. I tried to represent this with a powerful looming Chinese dragon, glinting the flag in its eyes, tipping the balance of a blindfolded Lady Justice. .

Today would have been my 9 year anniversary. Remembering my post from last year, and how hard that day was. Cyrus Gardner was more than forty years older than me, but I loved him. I adored him. He was a genius. And funny. And sexy. God, I loved the sound of his voice, and his laugh. I don’t know if he ever loved me, but I sure thought he did, for about a year and a half. He started going through medical treatments and... I don’t what happened. He changed. Became very cruel, very fast. And I stayed for 4 years hoping he’d come back. I woke up this morning and realized, I don’t love him. I’m so very glad. I’ll always differentiate in my mind the Cyrus I met from the creature he became. But I don’t love even that beloved man, now. Sorry, baby. We can’t meet again. Even if you came back to me. I’m out of your league now. | Repost from @iamsimonegardner using @RepostRegramApp - Tomorrow would have been my 8 year anniversary. Standing in line at the store, I wondered what I would go back and tell the young woman who was picking out her outfit 8 years ago tonight. I wondered what the me in the future might tell myself now.
...
The line was long. I watched the film strip from the two relationships I’ve had in my life. One long. One short. One mostly awful. One mostly happy, with an epically disastrous end. And in both, I felt like such a joke. Such a joke. I was ashamed remembering how I responded to their rejections and manipulations, like a demented puppy that kept running back for another kick to the gut. My face flushed. Fuck me, man.
...
Then, on my way back to the car, these little pieces of graffiti. “Don’t ever assume they think anything bad about you at all.” (Good advice.) “I feel like a joke.” (💔) And in thick black sharpie, someone’s response to another stranger’s turmoil: “You’re not a joke.”
...
It meant everything. That connection to people who felt enough to scribble out their agony and who cared enough to reassure someone who might never read their words. And who knows, maybe that was me, from another time, in another form, pulling out a sharpie or whispering in the ear of the person who did, saying: “Write. Let her know.” (Continued in comments)

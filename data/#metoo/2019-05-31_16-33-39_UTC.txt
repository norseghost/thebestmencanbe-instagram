An appreciation post ? Really ? 
Dear same person,
I could have just said thank u, next. And you would broken my face, blocked my ig account, removed me from your spam, changed your password and told me “you’re welcome, next.”
I can only remember Tejasvi Reddy who indirectly asked me to buzz off in ukg when I asked you for your naidu hall bag 😂😂😂 it’s been quite a journey! Hasn’t it ? Last year has been so blehhh! From teddy bears to inkem inkem to my dramatic asf phase to coffee to me not accepting myself cause of acne to heart broken fam to “thank u, next.” , “break up with your girlfriend, I’m bored.” , to “ACCEPTANCE” and finally to our messed soul swap. I’m only gonna blame you! You can’t even take care of a bracelet uhhh! I can actually thank you cause idk why I’ve cut down on all the drama, I’ve stopped screaming at Harish, I’m not raging these days, I’m not going psycho these days I’ve become a little more patient and finally I’ve started “accepting” my acne (although it has reduced a bit). It’s also cute how we’ve switched from muuds, fat hopes, PPP and fake nicki minaj, to paithyam, bcf, thank u, next, bm, APPLICATIONS 💦💦💦💦. But one thing that hasn’t changed is “PAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH” our memories are endless from EGGU CHANWICH to 300 in 10 seconds to SATIETY to OH SHEET to paithyam of the first order and finally back to square one, ACCEPTANCE. I know for a fact that we hate and love the same people cause AT THE END OF THE DAY (it’s been a while since we’ve said that) were the same person 😙😙😙😙. Idek why we’re being so sweet to each other 😂😂😂😂 And I also know for a fact that my caption is sweeter and better than yours ! “ACCEPTANCE “ can’t wait to buy new bracelets and get our souls back (although I like myself this way) and also for every thing you’ve done for me till now and you’re going to I’d like to say “thank u, next.”
Ps- the next time we fight we know what we’re archiving 💦💦😂😂☔️☔️
-same person.

I’m proud of the healing 𝘚𝘦𝘵 𝘔𝘦 𝘍𝘳𝘦𝘦 has not only brought myself, but for the way it’s impacted others. My goal of the book was to shed light on an important, yet difficult topic to speak on- childhood sexual assault. 𝘚𝘦𝘵 𝘔𝘦 𝘍𝘳𝘦𝘦, was created as poetry, which best helped me to express my experience at the time. If you haven’t yet already, go grab a copy! (Link in bio.) ✍🏼📖💜 Also, if you haven’t yet already, go give @thescarfoundation a follow! ✨⁣

With that being said, I am currently working on a new book, that will tell my whole story. It will highlight important issues and topics such as mental health, sexual assault, abuse, and self-growth. Get ready guys... ⁣
✨Coming in 2020! 😌📖✨ ⁣

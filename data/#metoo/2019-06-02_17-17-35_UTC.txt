This week we published a petition to add a KAWS Companion to the upcoming Toy Story 4 movie. Nearly 2,500 signatures later, Pixar has agreed to hear the culture's demands. A formal sit-down has been set to work out the details but progress has already been made to adding a Companion to the background of certain scenes. A surprise champion for our cause has been the ex-Pixar co-founder John Lasseter who was removed from the company after #metoo allegations last June. Lasseter saw our plight as an opportunity for Pixar to engage with a new audience and to help get his foot back in the door with the company. Lasseter has even offered to help with future Deadstock Report projects stating, "I love everything the culture has to offer and always enjoy engaging with a younger, more vulnerable audience."

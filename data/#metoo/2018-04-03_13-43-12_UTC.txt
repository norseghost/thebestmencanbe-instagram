It is Sexual Assault Awareness Month this art work is to let people know that they are not alone. Sexual Assault is a huge issue that needs to be addressed and brought to everyone’s attention. Please don’t be afraid to share your story, it needs to be heard. We can overcome Sexual Assault  together and try to put an end to it.

🦁 LINK IN BIO 👆🏽 if you haven’t yet listened to hear me roar, please do. it takes a lot of time and work to create {on top of what i actually do for a living.} more importantly, it takes heaps of courage on the part of the survivors who share. despite the subject matter, there is joy to be had! we laugh a lot and connect through our common humanity — often messy, and hugely imperfect.

in our fourth episode, a white male survivor of childhood sexual abuse shares anonymously. he struggles with memory and behavioral adaptions to trauma, including substance abuse — of which he is now, for over three years, clean. again, i really hope you give this a listen: it’s an important story. 🌈 shares, feedback, ratings, and reviews are highly appreciated. ⭐️ available on itunes, spotify, & podbean. if you need another way to hear it, please let me know. ⭐️ #survivor #metoo #newpodcast #podcast #podcasting #radio #podcasts #music #itunes #podcaster #stories #podcastlife #story #entrepreneur #love #whyididntreport #radioshow #texas #artist #podcastshow #art #podernfamily #podcastersofinstagram #losangeles #interview #storytelling #austin #business #healing

For so long, men have been forced to suppress their pain and deal with their problems alone. A lot of men go around wearing plastic smiles while dying inside. Wikipedia reported that suicide is more common among men than women.

Society has over time created a safe space for women and girls to express pain and injustice. We have channeled our energy towards fixing a broken generation of girls and women while neglecting the gender that needs attention the most, men.

When we begin to create a safe space for men; a safe space that allows them express their emotions and talk about their pain, violence against women and girls will begin to reduce drastically.

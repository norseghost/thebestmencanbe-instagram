Life is Great!! Each day my path changes direction and all the people I meet have huge impact on me and my life. I felt especially honoured to be photographed by the Wonderful @mrelbank who took time to get to know me as a person. He really brought out the best of me in every photo. His latest project is all about different types of Scars and the inspirational people behind them (or in front of them) haha! I would never pose nude or semi nude for anyone let alone be photographed but as I’ve learned ‘life can be taken away as quickly as it’s given’. I also believe that I myself and all those around me are here on this earth to ‘give back’. Each day I’m giving back by raising awareness and showing others that you can Thrive as well as Survive. If you would like to get involved in the Scar Project please contact Brock Elbank via email Scars@mrelbank.com #loveyourlines #effyourbeautystandards #showus #metoo #selflove #selfworth #selfcare #thisgirlcan #lifepurpose #positivevibesonly

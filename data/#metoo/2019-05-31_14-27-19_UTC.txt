To be a Woman

The woman i am today is a far cry from the woman I was in my 20s, 30s and 40s.

Turning 50 was initially a bit scary - I mean society would have you believe that life is over once you hit a certain age. 
Yes your body changes, you go through the menopause, you gain a few more wrinkles. ðŸ˜Š

But what they don't tell is that you become more confident and know who you are. You thank your body for getting you to your 50's. You're not driven by you biological clock to have children - so can focus more on your career, hobbies or what ever makes you happy. 
I had a lovely Life Coach a few years back - she described me as a lovely sweet with a shiny wrapper. And when you unwrapped me - the inside was just as lovely.

So for me being a woman is about being strong without being hard. 
HavingÂ the courage to stand up for myself and go for what I want in life. 
Saying sorry when I've messed up. Helping/supporting my friends as they go through their life journeyâ€™s

Being authenticate - that mean's being Donna warts and all. 
And finally - never compromising my integrity and knowing my true value.

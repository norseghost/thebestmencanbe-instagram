I’ve gained 5 pounds and I’m going insane! I can’t shake this “Unconscious” Primal Female Drive, & even though I am aware of it, the drive to be thin is driven primarily from unconsciousness impulses. I am driven to maintain being thin to be pleasing to men, or Society, or to please or keep a husband, on the unconscious level. .
No matter how hard I try not to identify with this Primal Female Programming that came from my Primal Female Family Members, in my case my Mother and Grandmother, I fail! No matter how conscious of this programming I am, or how far up the ladder to enlightenment I get, I still can’t get to being at Peace yet! Man! 🤣This thing is deep! 
Make a note that when you work on yourself, you start with what is the more obvious in yourself in the form of your thoughts and feelings that you are in touch with, and as you grow, you grow deeper and deeper into discovering what runs you Unconsciously, until you get down to the Primal Animal Drives Within. Food, Sex/Procreation, Sleep & Survival of the Self. The Sex/Procreation Drive is the Primal Drive that I’m referring to here, as the source of the desire to please Men & Society & thereby Living up to our Female Roles in Society, like Marriage, Motherhood, etc., all of which comes from the Animal Drive within. These are the Primal Drives that run our Life and Society in general that I am addressing today! .. CONT.  POST 2 WITH SAME PHOTO - - - . . .

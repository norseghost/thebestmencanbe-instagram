"At some point, Feibleman apparently suspected heâ€™d be accused of sexual misconduct, according to the New York Post , so he used his phone to begin taping their encounter in her room. When the woman leveled accusations against him, Feibleman was able to turn over the 30-minute recording to university investigators.

But the evidence was not enough to appease investigators, who also felt that the woman was too drunk to even consent to sex. Columbia is holding Feibleman responsible for sexual assault, expelling him and withholding his degree even though he technically graduated." I highly advise reading this article if you still think #Metoo and #Title9 are actually helpful to people.

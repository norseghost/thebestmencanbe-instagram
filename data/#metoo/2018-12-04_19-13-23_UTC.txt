Our art project "UR-Weiblichkeit" is focussed on woman rights. In the DAX companies, fewer women than men are board members with the first name Michael and Thomas. The #metoo campaign reported painful experiences of sexual harassment in the workplace. Women and men are paid almost anywhere differently for the same work. On 19/01/1919 women in Germany were allowed to vote for the first time. 2018 there are only 13 elected female heads of state. 80% of single parents are women. The five world religions use for over 1000 years their power still to preach that women are worth less.

UR-Weiblichkeit is powerful, caring, protective, graceful, wise and kind.

So if you want to join the art project, tagged your art work with #urweiblichkeit

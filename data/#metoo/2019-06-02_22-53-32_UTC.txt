It is only by actively seeking out silence that you give your inner voice  a chance to speak and warn you about the red flags you might miss in a new relationship, in your marriage, or your workplace. Don’t dismiss your concerns or try to justify the toxic behavior of others. If words or behavior hurt you, then you are not “ blowing things out of proportion”. If the pattern of hurtful words her behavior continues and the other person is not “just joking around”. Listen to your inner voice, Because often times no one else will listen to you

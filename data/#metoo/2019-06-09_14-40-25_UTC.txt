Everyone plays a different part in your life. You will have mentors, teachers, friends / family, challengers, the list goes on and on. Even the people who hurt you will teach you something valuable. Cherish every person you meet & embrace your interactions with them. Accept help, advice, and criticism. 🌷 #createdinthechaos

“Currently men outnumber women anywhere from 2:1 to 3:1 onscreen. Women tend to hire more women which leads to more female-led content being made; so to change the conversation onscreen we need to change the conversation behind the screen.” –Victoria Emslie (Downtown Abbey) 👏Thrilled by the @festivaldecannes announcement of the launch of Primetime, a new database which spotlights women from all over the world working above the line and below the line in film– a brilliant step towards hiring of more women in the industry!

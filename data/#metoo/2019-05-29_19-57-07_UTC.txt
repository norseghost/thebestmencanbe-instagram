Gotten a chance to RSVP for our monthly U.N. Info Session? This month we’re talking about the menstruation taboo affecting MILLIONS of girls across the globe. Not only does this silence them, but it prevents them from obtaining resources NEEDED to benefit their health and overall well-being. Join us in understanding more about this topic and how YOU can get involved in your local community! RSVP via our Facebook page for this incredible, FREE, event! •

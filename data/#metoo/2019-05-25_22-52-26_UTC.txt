Don't panic! Things are changing, but I think it's going to be a great adventure. For those of you who follow @dvchristendom, you already know me. For those of you who don't, well, we're going to have fun. There's no way I'm going to be able to convince you I'm a perfectly normal beast. My name is Jenne, I've been a part of Dinah's Voice since before it was Dinah's Voice. I'm the new Program Director and I'll be running the social media for DV. I'm so excited to be here with y'all!! We're going to be talking about ending rape culture, consent education, mental health, feminism, and how it all ties together with being Catholic. 
Do you think we could get 42 comments on this post? If we do, I'll post something funny. I haven't decided what yet. Picture of me hitchhiking? 42 fun facts about me? No that's way too many. Audio clip of me singing so long and thanks for all the fish? 
You know what, you guys decide! So grab your towels and let's get going!! #metoo #christendomtoo #franciscantoo #consenteducation #endrapeculture #feminist #womensrightsarehumanrights #mentalhealth #dontpanic #42 #internationaltowelday

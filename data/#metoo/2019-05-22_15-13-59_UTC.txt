#metoo is a global issue. Sex is a taboo topic in many places in the world. I grew up in a culture where sex isn't discussed (or even acknowledged as something that happens until marriage) and I strongly believe this contributes to misogyny and even rape culture. Mona's brave initiative encouraging victims to speak out is one fantastic example of what we can and should do to discourage sexual assault anywhere, regardless of gender, faith, geography or anything else.

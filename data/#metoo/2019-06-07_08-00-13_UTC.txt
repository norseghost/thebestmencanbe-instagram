Florence - The artwork of the so called “madonnari” is brutally run over by a bus.... in these times of #metoo #womensrights # its an interesting picture. Society and religions still do not allow women to be strong, empowered, have a voice or certain rights. This image made by @bettina__zagnoli frames it all.

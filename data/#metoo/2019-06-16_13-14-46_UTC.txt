Truly a victory for all of us. A victory that demonstrates the power of a Victim Impact Statement and the power of expressing our anger about how a case was handled. Thank you to Emily Doe for your brave and moving words. She has testified and she has been heard. Her courage and conviction are helping to change views about sexual assault and court rulings. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/06/06/judge-aaron-persky-who-gave-brock-turners-lenient-sentence-sanford-rape-case-recalled/674551002/

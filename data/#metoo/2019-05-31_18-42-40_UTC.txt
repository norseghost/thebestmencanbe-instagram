Whoa. Deep right? Have you ever let yourself down? #metoo
.
Don't beat yourself up about it. Whether you didn't keep your word to yourself or you didn't honor your intuition - your gut feeling, you can change that pattern.
.
1️⃣ Acknowledge it ISN'T just you...we ALL have had this issue
2️⃣ Decide this is an area you want to change
3️⃣ Accept that you did the best you knew how to do and that your brain is complicated AF
4️⃣ Make a decision about one MINOR thing you'll do (or not do)
5️⃣ Implement ⤴️ for one week and stick to the plan
.
If it feels like the one MINOR change isn't signficant enough to have an impact, you're on the right track...I promise. Once you've mastered keeping your word to yourself for that one minor thing, then you can slowly scale up.
.
If you want some help with this, let me know! I'm happy to offer tips.

In HATE & THREATS\nBy ALL groups:\nMay 21, 2019 - 8:36 pm by VIBE Staff\n\nThe Chi actress, Tiffany Boone, is being publicly shamed on social media after she accused her co-star, Jason Mitchell, of sexual harassment.\nThe offensive comments rang out in the comments section of her photo posts on Instagram. While we'd rather not highlight negative remarks shaming an alleged victim of sexual misconduct, it's safe to say that the comments are pretty tasteless.\n\nDespite the negative feedback, Boone has also been swarmed by fans who are defending her. \"The simple fact some people are attacking her is f**king ludicrous to me, one Instagram user wrote. \"Some of y\u2019all are asking, why did she get Jason Mitchell fired? Really? He got his own a** fired! If he would\u2019ve conducted himself like he was supposed to, his a** would still be on the show!\"\nJason Mitchell Fired From 'The Chi' Over Misconduct Allegations\n\nAs previously reported, Boone, who plays Jerrika on the Lena Waithe-produced drama, accused Mitchell of making sexual advances toward her on set. Boone allegedly felt so \"unsafe\" that she asked her fianc\u00e9, actor Marque Richardson, to be on set with her when Mitchell was around, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\nBoone was not the only one to complain about the star. Multiple women have come forward to speak up about similar interactions with the actor. As a result of the recent reports, Mitchell has been dropped from The Chi along with his talent agent UTA, his management team and an upcoming role in Netflix\u2019s movie Desperados.\n\nJason Mitchell Has A Lot To Say About 'The Chi' Season 2 And How We Failed Nipsey Hussle\nIn This Story: \nJason Mitchell"

She went after her assailant all the way to the hallowed grounds of a courtroom \u2013 and won. Her symbolic victory brought issues like sexual abuse and harassment into the spotlight. Taylor, along with other brave women, inspired a generation to break their silence and collectively seek justice for crimes that have been swept under the rug for too long; the #MeToo movement.\u2063\u2063\u2800\n\u2063\u2063\u2800\nWhen: Taylor Swift has been serenading us with her charming, yet powerful and socially aware songs that speak to the youth since the late 2000s. Take 2010 hit, \u201cMean,\u201d a widely popular anti-bullying anthem that has brought hope to bullied children around the globe. She\u2019s also a frequent donor of the Red Cross, UNICEF, and an advocate of LGBTQ rights and gender equality up to this day.\u2063\u2063\u2800\n\u2063\u2063\u2800\nWhere: The #MeToo movement has generated over 19 million tweets ever since its conception a couple of years ago. That just goes to show how much impact it had to the world. Most notably, and perhaps most inspiring, was its effect to Hollywood, where stars from all of the industry\u2019s rankings and stature are starting to come forward to state their piece, each a step towards ending gender-based violence.\u2063\u2063\u2800\n\u2063\u2063\u2800\nWhy: \"Fearless is not the absence of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death.\u201c\u2063\u2063\u2800\n\u2063\u2063\u2800\n\u2063\u2063\u2800\n\u2063\u2063\u2800\n\u2063\u2063\u2800\n\u2063\u2063\u2800\n@taylorswift\u2063\u2063\u2800\n\u2063\u2063\u2800\n#metoomovement #taylorswift #swifties #fearless #speaknow #UNICEF \u2063\u2063\u2800\n#me #taylorswiftme #youbelongwithme #lovestory #totallytaylor #celebrityfeminist\u2063\u2063\u2800\n#mean #feminism #unicorn #unicornlady"

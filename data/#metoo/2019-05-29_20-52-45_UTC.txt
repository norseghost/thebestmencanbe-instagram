There will be a screening of the short film caressed, followed by an artist talk and Q & A by Niki Lopez. 🐘🎨
Monthly Film Series: “*Montage”* to Showcase Local Emerging Filmmakers at the City’s Cultural Venues. “This short film 'Caressed' is an art film and a self-portrait, mixed-media video installation combining performance art and a poem I wrote about a traumatic childhood memory,” explained Lopez, who was featured in People magazine regarding her growing up in a cult and the ensuring abuse. “This intimate piece is a part of series with my personal artwork within the art movement: What’s Your Elephant – Creative Conversations about the Unknown.” The intentions behind Lopez’ work is to not only share a personal elephant but to have discussions surrounding unspoken topics such as abuse, survivors of abuse, awareness, the power of a ‘share’ and how the arts can be used to heal, to empower and to educate. This session will consist of a video screening, performance and artist lead discussion based on the mission of “What’s Your Elephant.” .

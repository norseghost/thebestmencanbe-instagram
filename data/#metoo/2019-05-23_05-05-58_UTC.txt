Hi i’m back !!!! Sorry for being so inactive i’ve been hella busy with AP tests and Finals:( anywayyy my APUSH teacher wrote me a really nice comment on my grade and it made me all smiley:)) Earlier this year, I told him how he’s kinda like a father figure in a way to me and he’s literally so nice to me i cry:)) and this picture is kinda sad and makes me feel gross but i’ve been feeling lowkey really numb lately and flashbacks have been happening more often than not so that sucks:/ also I love you guys sO MUCH !!! I can’t believe i’m almost at 600 followers this is like a dream!!

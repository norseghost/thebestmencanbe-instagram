Since most women don’t talk to each other about their periods, we have very little idea of what’s normal and what isn’t normal. Many women assume that their menstrual cycles are normal because they have no reference point. A woman’s period could be wildly abnormal, but she wouldn’t know because she’s never talked to another woman to see what they’re experiencing.

Not understanding what constitutes a normal period often leads women to suffer with reproductive illnesses for years without being diagnosed. A prime example of this is endometriosis. Women with endometriosis have really awful periods. They bleed heavily and experience debilitating cramps.

However, many women with endometriosis believe that their periods are relatively normal. We’ve been taught from a young age that periods suck and we should just deal, so when our periods are really bad, we often just think we’re overreacting.

Many women live with endometriosis undiagnosed for seven to ten years. If these women had been willing to talk about their periods with other women they’d be able to find out that their periods were worse than their friends’ periods and seek help.

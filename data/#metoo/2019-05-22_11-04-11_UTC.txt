I think it's important as a women to know who you are and what you deserve. We, ourselves set the boundaries of what we choose to accept.Â Do react.
Instead of complaining about the men who's actions don't fit your own vision: move on, karma will find them and find one that does treat you like you deserve. Do not make the same mistake I did and hate men because of the few fools you've met...
It steals your own happiness, not theirs

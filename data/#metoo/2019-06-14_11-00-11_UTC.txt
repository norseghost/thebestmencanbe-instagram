I know Laura personally and when she submitted her story, I was shocked. You really never know what someone has been through.⠀
This is one part of her story, but she did make it through this and break the cycle of abuse. She also faced her abuser in court, something that is very rare. Thank you, Laura, for bravely sharing your story.⠀

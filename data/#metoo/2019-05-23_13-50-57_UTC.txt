Always thinking. I could not for the life of me sleep last night. Thinking is hard and tiring and annoying. Staying up late, I searched â€™how to stop thinkingâ€™ online. Let me tell you, I didn't think any of the suggestions would work. This morning I decided to write in a journal. Not like a diary that every 7 year old girl wishes to write in; this is an actual journal given to me by an amazing family member. Maybe I'll keep up with it, maybe I won't. I do know, though, that it helped me gather my thoughts and what I wanted to focus on today. If your mind is tiring you out, just find a way to organize your thoughts rather than get rid of them. Sometimes we need a little chaos in our minds to have something worth fighting for. Wish me luck on Finals today ðŸ˜¬

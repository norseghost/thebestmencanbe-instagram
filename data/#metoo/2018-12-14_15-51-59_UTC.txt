On The Peak
We walk a thin vale, 
that lies between truth and fable. 
Our life a tale with countless perspectives, 
the goal of soul to stay objective. 
The peak so steep, the mountain tall. 
The time has come to climb or fall! 
The past holds safe, the warmth of old. 
The future loomâ€™s, it calls the bold. 
So you look up, your eyes ascend. 
They reach the peak while tears descend. 
You can go back, you know itâ€™s true. 
But if you climb I promise you, 
that on the peak youâ€™ll find your truth. mantra_matt ðŸ’šðŸ”¥ðŸ’š. L

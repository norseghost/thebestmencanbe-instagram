I share my family's story with nearly all my classes. I share client's and friend's stories. I share stories of strangers who overcame incredible odds. Why? Because these are seeds of resilience, strength, inspiration and proper mindset. Seeds that those I teach can draw from, grow from and utilize if they ever need to. I've had countless girls muster the courage to share their own trauma with their classmates or to ask for help from a secret they've been keeping for far too long. Never underestimate the power of your courage to share your story. Use your voice, even if it trembles. ğŸ’•ğŸ’ªğŸŒ±ğŸŒ³

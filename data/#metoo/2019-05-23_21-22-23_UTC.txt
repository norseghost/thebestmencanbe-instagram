Sorting through my belongings in preparation for moving house and found my 10,000 word Masters degree dissertation from 9 years ago. 
In hindsight, 22 is a very young age to be researching and writing a dissertation on such an important and sensitive topic. 9 years on and from news reports, discussions with friends and from working with patients who have experienced sexual assault and rape, it is clear to me that this is an area that is still not effectively dealt with and that some people still hold extremely ignorant viewpoints in. Sadly, even the CPS fail victims, and out of 230 rapes reported to the Police, only 5 lead to a conviction. 
I do hope that the law is slowly moving forward though and following some high profile rape cases, and the #metoo campaign we are pushing the message forward regarding rape culture. Hopefully in another 9 years such failings to victims will be a things of past #rapeculture #notokay

The story of Sister Corita Kent, the Pop-art nun, is a touching one. Born in 1918 in Fort Dodge, Iowa, Kent moved to Hollywood with her family that same year and later earned her BA at Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles. In 1947, she enrolled in graduate school at the University of Southern California, where she focused on screen printing and finished her degree in 1951. By the following year, she was already making headway, winning awards for her prints in a Los Angeles County-wide contest.

In search of inspiration, she travelled to Europe and Egypt, collecting works of folk art, but her real revelation came in 1962, when she saw Andy Warhol‘s Campbell’s Soup Cans at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles, which completely changed her style.  Pop art, she realized, could be a powerful messaging tool for social justice—which is exactly what she made it into.

Kent went on to create works for the Vatican Pavilion at the 1963 Venice Biennale, but later met increasing resistance from conservative quarters of the Church, who disliked her spunky sensibility. Later, she sought dispensation from the Church and moved to Boston, before dying in 1986 from cancer. #sistercoritakent #femaleartist #womanartist #femalepopartist #femalephotographer #femmeartiste #warholinspired #socialjustice #womenempowerment #womenforwomen #metoo #artsfemin

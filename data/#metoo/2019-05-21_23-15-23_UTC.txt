I’ve been silent on the recent anti-abortion laws in the Southern United States that will affect the wellbeing and bodily autonomy of my fellow sisters and humans with uteruses. I’ve been processing this news for days now, and I’m still in shock and disbelief.

What’s happening is nothing short of terrifying. It’s outrageous. Banning abortions doesn’t stop abortions, it stops SAFE abortions. Black market alternatives to the hospitalized procedure are dangerous and life-threatening. It doesn’t matter why the pregnant person chooses to have an abortion - it is their business and none of ours. I know soooo many amazing, bright, kind, creative women who had chosen to abort, and I support their choice 💯. So grateful to live in a country that keeps its legal nose out of my uterus. What you choose to do with your body is your choice, quit policing other people’s choices. Get your sh*t together, America! ❣️

A day that changed my life. I got to meet @jvandis in person for the 1st and was invited to be a part of a organization that I prayed would one day exist. This is me in the middle of 2nd yr law school, sleep deprived, run down and feeling like it is all worth it because my wildest dream just came true. Thank you SHEros. The best is yet to come!ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•@TimesUp @timesuphc .

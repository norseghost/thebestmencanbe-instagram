A⭐⭐⭐⭐ #review of an epic novel.

Pub Date 6/11/2019

As I'm not typically a Woman's Fiction reader, I was hesitant to read this one. Now that I have all I can say is I Loved It! This sweeping, generational story is perfect in the time of the #metoo movement and women's continued struggles for equality. 
The story starts in the 1950's following sisters Jo and Bethie as they navigate life, the consequences of choices made and dysfunctional families. I enjoyed getting a first hand look into their lives with the wonderfully descriptive writing and story telling by the author. As the story moves through the years up to the present we see how societal norms and the pressures of the times affect their lives and the decisions that they make. It's at once a story about mothers, sisters, daughters and girlfriends, a love story, as well as a story of historical significance. I highly recommend this one to anyone interested in women's experiences and challenges they have faced and continue to face. One of these days I'll no longer be able to say, I don't normally read women's Fiction as I've really enjoyed those I've ventured to pick up and read.

Thank you @goodreads and @atriabooks for my copy to read and enjoy.

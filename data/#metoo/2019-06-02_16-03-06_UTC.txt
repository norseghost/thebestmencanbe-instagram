America's court system is built on principals of nonpartisanship. Judges swear to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land, not pursue their own whims and feelings. But in the last few years, the public has become more and more aware of political bias within the court system. President Donald Trump and others frequently claim judges have a partisan bias. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts recently spoke out and claimed judges are not biased. What do you think?

May wrap-up and mini reviews!

The Mummy Bloggers: smart, funny, and over-the-top story about three mom bloggers in Australia. Lots of fun, but also thought provoking. Releases June 3!

The Idea of You: sexy contemporary fiction about a 39yo woman’s romantic affair with a 20yo boy band member. Left me emotionally drained for days.

Miracle Creek: a “literary courtroom drama” exploring parenting, guilt, honesty, immigration, and much more. Really liked this one.

My Lovely Wife: domestic suspense about a husband and wife who keep their marriage fresh by murdering people. Great plot and twists!

Whisper Network: a #metoo story about four women and their creeper boss. Smart, sharp, and engaging. Releases June 25!

An Anonymous Girl: psychological cat and mouse about a young women involved in a psychological research project that becomes personal.

How Not To Die Alone: moving story about a quirky man discovering how to live again after a tragedy.

Bollywood actor Tanushree Dutta slammed police after veteran actor Nana Patekar got clean chit due to lack of evidence in a sexual harassment case.

The Ashiq Banaya Aapne Actress filed a case against Patekar last year in September accusing him of assaulting her on the sets of Horn Ok Pleaseâ€™ in 2008 while shooting for a special dance number for the movie.

Mumbai police closed the case on Thursday on account of evidence not found against the accused.

It’s so healing to wake up in a silent house and silently make your own coffee or tea, and enjoy the beautifully intricate fullness of the morning silence while remaining calm and collected and unbothered by all outer and inner noise. It’s so low key elevating to rejoice in the silent atmosphere of your own home and just silently block the rest of the world...it’s a slice of heaven.

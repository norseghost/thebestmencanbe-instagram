Best story line I’ve seen in a while!! The harsh reality of sexual assault is, he’s not always a pervy neighbour, or a stranger sitting in the park, he’s the lad you went to school with, he’s your friend, he’s your husband! Good on Hollyoaks for bringing sexual assault within relationships/marriages to light! #hollyoaks #breakthesilence #metoo #sinead #laurie @hollyoaksofficial @stephaniedavis88

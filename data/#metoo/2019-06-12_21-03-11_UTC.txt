The REAL Interior ...üí´

‚ú®
‚ÄúDear African Child, 
You are allowed to fail before you can succeed. 
You are allowed to cry when a part of you breaks.
‚ú®
You are allowed to feel pain, you're only human. ‚ú®
You are allowed to sing when you're happy, even if your voice doesn't allow singing.
‚ú®
You're allowed to fight for a beautiful life‚Äù...üí´
Poem by Mihle Zitha (cosmofunnel.com)

With Love and PRIDE

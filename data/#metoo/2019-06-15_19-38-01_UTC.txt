This Sunday is Fathers' Day in the US. It can be a really difficult time for survivors of childhood trauma - for so many reasons. So, of course we wanted to share a loving message with you.

While these "smaller holidays" are meant to be sweet and celebratory, they can sometimes sneak up and be the most challenging. There are so many ways the hurt can surface -- fear, grief, loss, guilt, confusion, exasperation, worry, sadness. For many of you, it's a confusing combination of all the above.
.
Please know we are thinking of you and sending out our utmost compassion and strength. We truly hope you can find it in yourself to make this a day for YOU, and nourish your spirit in all the ways it's been neglected lately. *sending warmth and empathy* .

                        "text": "\"Just living is not enough. One must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower.\" - Hans Christian Andersen.\n.\n\nMy Wild Child and I. Feeling a lot of feels today. \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b\n.\n\nShe has an after school program, every Wednesday, at the church up the road. This was the last one of the school year. We had cake and ice cream, and walked home in the sunshine. We decided to lay outside, in the grass, because it's such a glorious evening. .\n\nAnd to celebrate a little bit. A huge, huge load taken off of Abby's shoulders. I hadn't talked about it publicly, as it was going on. But... Abby's been meeting with a court-appointed Victim Advocate, preparing for a trial, against a neighborhood teenage boy who's lucky this momma bear can control her temper. I won't say more than that. It has been incredibly heartbreaking, watching her go through this.\n.\n\nThe prosecutors office called earlier, to tell me the boy changed his plea today. Abby was so amazingly strong and brave and well-spoken when the defense did his interview with her, they decided to plead guilty - so now my poor girl wont need to go through the extra trauma of a trial. This has been dragging for months, she cries often, worried about when court might be. And now, it's over. She can move past it. .\n\nSo we laid in the grass together. Watching clouds, taking silly Snapchats, her telling me fart jokes she learned at school, in between hugging me and telling me how relieved she is. .\n\nLife is never smooth sailing. Life is weird, and hard things happen. But my heart is 100x lighter today, knowing this storm has passed. . \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b\n.\n\n#momlifeisthebestlife #momlife\ud83d\udc95 #sunshinelover #playoutside #girlmomlife #girlmom #mommabear #protectivemama #minibff #newglasses #playeveryday #thatmomlife #goodnews #weightoffmyshoulders #sunshineandsmiles #momofagirl #raisingdaughters #raisinggirls #raisingthefuture #raisingstronggirls #girlpower #stronggirls #likemotherlikedaughter #metoo #momanddaughtertime #momselfie"

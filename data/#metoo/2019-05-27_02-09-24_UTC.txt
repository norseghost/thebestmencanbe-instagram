Book no. 31 of 2019
Part memoir and part feminist theory, this work by @amberrosetamblyn definitely made me stop and think about women and their role in America. 
Tamblyn examines herself and the new era of ignition, a new wave of feminism, following the 2016 presidential election, through the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements. She is insightful, intellectual, and inspiring. 
I liked how she owned her privilege and her own failures. I admired her for honestly and opening sharing them. I also liked how she provided perspectives from women of color and from the LGTBTQIA community. 
I did eventually become annoyed with the constant use of fiery language. After awhile, words like ignite, ember, and ignition just started to lose their luster for me. But don’t let that take away from this work. 
It was a good read for people today to start a discussion about women, equality, racism, injustice, and misogyny.

I have never been to a rally or protest but this movement means a lot to me. Rape prevention techniques I discovered when I was about 14/15 and even then I was shocked about how the responsibility was put on the potential victims. - Don\u2019t dress that way\n- Don\u2019t drink that much\n- Have a buddy system\nEtc etc\nSo if you don\u2019t follow the rules it\u2019s somehow your fault? Are you a slut? Did you deserve it?...BULLSHIT!\n.\n.\nAlthough I think some safety precautions have their place, there was never any onus on the criminal and to this day it isn\u2019t all the way there. We\u2019ve all heard the \u201cit shouldn\u2019t ruin the life of a young mans with so much promise\u201d \ud83e\udd2e\n.\n.\nAs I grew up I understood more about the cruel sexually violent history against women (and men), I learned about consent and what that means and how convoluted that can become when there is someone who is so focused on getting what they want they fail to see what\u2019s in front of them. You do not have a right to anyone. If someone is drunk af and they say yes...it doesn\u2019t matter. Their judgement impaired. That is not consent. If they still want to have sex with you when they\u2019re sober and have all their faculties...go for it!\n.\n.\nEducation and understanding around consent should be an important part of a child\u2019s life. The same as respect for yourself and for others, no matter how that person identifies. .\n.\nIf you think something has happened to you, talk to someone. There are people out there who can help and understand what you\u2019re going through xxx\n.\n.\n.\nI drew this myself but it is not watermarked for a reason. I didn\u2019t feel right putting it on. The message belongs to everyone so please feel free to share it as much as you want xx"

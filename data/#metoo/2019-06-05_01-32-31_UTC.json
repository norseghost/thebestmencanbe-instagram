                        "text": "This is my aunt Bib.  She\u2019s made every birthday and every graduation.  She\u2019s loaned me money, helped me out of jams, covered for me, and has always been one of my biggest fans.  And yes, she might\u2019ve let me see the movie Scarface when I was way too little \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f, but she\u2019s pretty much one of the best human beings on the planet.  She\u2019s hella funny, smart, she don\u2019t take no mess, and she\u2019s been openly gay for as long as I can remember. .\n.\nOur family is a HUGE ally for the LGBTQ community so we\u2019ve never had a problem giving her the kind of love and support she truly deserves.  But even with that, her journey has been a difficult one.  Growing up a Latina in South LA trying to navigate her way to accept who she truly is and knowing that she wouldn\u2019t always get the acceptance from others must\u2019ve been incredibly hard.  She has experienced societal pressures and even cultural pressures from some of her very own people that literally had her fighting for her life.  No, I don\u2019t pretend to know her experience on any level.  There\u2019s no way I can.  But what I do know is that there are many people out there like my aunt Bib, who share the same kind of stories...stories of struggle, stories of resilience, and stories of fight.  But please know this...your stories and your lives are an inspiration. You make me wanna be better.  Thank you \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe #pridemonth\ud83d\udc9c\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\n.\n.\nBuy music and support domestic violence awareness. \u270a\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc78\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc9c\ud83c\udfb6 (link in the bio)\n.\n.\n#metoo #feminist #bodyshaming #womensrights #intersectionalfeminism #feministforeverybody #timesup #speakup #iwollnotbesilent #tellyourstory #useyourvoiceforchange #socialjusticewarrior #bravewomen #sexualviolence #domesticviolence #preventionispossible #startbybelieving #ibelieveyou #healingfromwithin #nomore #mentalhealth #loveyourself\n#eastlosangeles #eastlosangeleswomenscenter #dopemusic #indiemusic #acousticmusic #imabeautifulmess #dcastmusic"

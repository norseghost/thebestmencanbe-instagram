It’s been almost a week since the final episode of #GameOfThrones aired and I (@goethesgartenhaus) needed some time to process my huge disappointment about the end of the show.
{Spoilers ahead} While season 8 (and season 7 for that matter) were completely rushed and contained many plot holes, illogical writing and lack of believable character development, I am still happy about the variety of incredible and complicated female characters the show gave us: Brienne, Ayra, Sansa, Dany, Cersei, Missandei, Yara and the list goes on. And at least one female character truly came out as a winner at the end of the fantasy epic: Sansa Stark. After all the bullshit and violence she had to put up with by the men in her life, she deservedly became the Queen of the independent North 👸🐺⚔️. Of course she should have been considered for the Iron Throne by Tyrion and recognized as the most capable leader. But Sansa should be happy she doesn’t have to rule over that mess (Good luck Bran/Tyrion 🤦🏻‍♀️). I‘m very happy that she turned into this smart and powerful woman when all the cards were stacked against her 👏!
➡️ Which character‘s ending did you find most fitting or satisfying? And were you happy with the ending of #GoT?

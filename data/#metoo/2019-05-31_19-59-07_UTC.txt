I want to invite you to I’m Not An Empty Vessel Women’s Conference on June 30th. The theme is I'm Starting With The Women In The Mirror. We are going to focus on the woman that Is being reflected in the mirror mentally, emotionally, and physically. There will be a mental health therapist available to give us tips on maintaining a healthy mind. I pray that you can attend & bring a friend.

✨✨✨ “Is this what growing into an adult woman is, having to predict and accordingly arrange for the avoidance of sexual harassment?” #Queenie - it’s being hailed as the read of the summer, ‘the black Bridget Jones’. It’s not my read of the summer (I might be too old) but it is thoroughly enjoyable, and an eye-opening and thought provoking vignette into the life of a millennial. 1.) I was happily under the impression that the millennial generation were more confident when it comes to taking ownership of their bodies than the Generation X-ers, especially in a post-#metoo landscape - but not Queenie: I spent half the novel remembering some of the dreadful/ awkward dates/ encounters I suffered  in my early 20s, and inwardly screaming at her not to take some random man home and allow him to have unprotected anal sex with her... (she didn’t hear me) 2.) the casual racism encountered every single day, and the sexual harassment that comes with it... 3.) that struggle to figure out who you are, which is universal, but perhaps made harder by the cultural clash in families where the grandparents immigrated, which I remember Riz Ahmed explaining to me when I interviewed him a couple of years ago, and which #CandiceCartyWilliams shows here brilliantly, without over analysing it, but pondering endlessly on what sort of black woman Queenie wants to be/ is/ thinks she is supposed to be... 4.) Remembering Arinze Kene’s bemoaning of the lack of cycling montages in ‘black’ films - well, here we have it - not actually cycling, but a totally relatable if occasionally shocking coming-of-age story.... so 5.) I really look forward to reading what she writes next ✨✨✨

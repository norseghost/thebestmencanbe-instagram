Yesterday I was working on my affirmations. I stopped using them daily in the morning's and I want to start back up again.
.
I used to think this was just incredibly lame. Who just looks in the mirror and repeats they are beautiful and all with a straight face and not laugh.

But repeating this stuff every day, saying it out loud, rewires your thinking. Especially if you repeat them throughout the day.

This is a tool used to think more positive. Just try changing one thought to positive and repeat it every day, or several times a day and see how your mindset changes

Michelle opened up to the Drama Actress Roundtable on her role in the gender wage gap discussion. After Kevin Spacey was replaced by Christopher Plummer in 2017's All The Money In The World, it was revealed that Mark Wahlberg earned $1.5 million to return for reshoots, while Williams was paid a per diem allowance of about $1,000. "As far as anything that's happened in my life publicly," Williams told the roundtable, "it's the most exciting and the most important thing that I've ever been involved in."
"I'm so moved, personally and professionally, to have found my place in the conversation and my voice through the conversation. [I] feel like I've grown up inside of the conversation. It's the thing that I'll feel the closest to, more than any work that I've ever done, if I can just incrementally move the needle for other women." #michellewilliams #metoo

Message from @cthagod ....We don’t play crazy, stop stigma... We be needing help but people dismiss us because it’s a disease you can’t see mental health is real. I been diagnosed with depression and anxiety as a child from going through sh*t as a child. I was even getting a check from the government as a child for my anxiety and depression. Family knew about my suicide attempt I was only 13/14yrs old, I overdosed myself. That pain turned into anger and rage, as I got older that anger went away all I needed was help everyone just called me crazy and go years without speaking to me. Only my Mother and my oldest Sister Meka stayed even though they never understood me #stopthestigma #ohana #depression #anxiety #girlgetup #metoo #metoomovement #women #womenempowerment #iseeyou #iexist #imhere #lovewins #love #beautiful #compassion #peace #peaceofmind #loveher #mentalhealthawareness

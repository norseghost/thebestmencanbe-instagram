Someone said to me “you like having your tits out”. NO. Actually of all the things I hate about myself #1 is my boobs. They make me uncomfortable, but that’s not the point of this post. The point is that summer is upon us, it’s hot out, clothes are suffocating to hers, hims and theys and everyone in between. Just because my clothes may reveal cleavage, nipples and skin doesn’t mean I’m trying to flaunt it around, it just means the ☀️ is hot af! Don’t sexualize my boobs because I sure as hell am not. Do not assume I enjoy showing them off, i sure as hell do not. Do not assume I am trying to get cat called, I SURE AS HELL AM NOT. It’s 2019, not 2008 so #staywoke 👏🏻👏🏻 #summer #youdontknowme #important #voice #metoo #mybody

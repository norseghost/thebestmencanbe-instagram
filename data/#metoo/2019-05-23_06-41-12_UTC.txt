Nothing is a distraction when you’re focused. 🖤

Listen, while Trump was destroying our country, Black men getting shot left & right, white folks calling the police on Black people, China buying up Africa, immigrants getting abused and detached from their children, the #metoo movement, we still have to survive. There’s always going to be something going on. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. 🖤

We are not monolith people. You can talk about and care about issues and people and still function. Life is happening. You can take a few minutes away from securing the bag and care for humanity. We love people and we stand against injustice. It’s just part of why we are and what we do 👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾✊🏾 - 🖤

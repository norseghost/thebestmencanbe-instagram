                        "text": "#qotd Do you think your country is safer than it was 10 years ago?\n\nSohaila Abdulali\u00a0was gang-raped when she was seventeen-years-old in Mumbai. She wrote an article for a magazine at the time talking about rape, sex offenders and rape victims. This article surfaced again when Jyoti Singh (Nirbhaya) was gang-raped on 16th December 2012 in Delhi. The whole country mourned and was outraged at the heinous crime and wanted justice for Jyoti.\u00a0After this, we started to have open conversations about sexual assault and recently, #metoo campaign was also blown up throughout the country where women were coming out and speaking up about sexual assault they have faced over the years.\n\nWhat We Talk About When We Talk about Rape by Sohaila Abdulali\u00a0is a collection of her own experience, other\u2019s experiences, her research, and her personal thoughts on what we talk about rape, what we don\u2019t talk about rape, what we should actually talk about rape, what\u2019s wrong with the system and the society and a lot more.\n\nAbdulali has worked for years for rape crisis centers and I think she knows what she is talking about because she encounters rape survivors everybody and listens to them and understands them and over that she is a survivor herself. She has also talked about how differently we educate girls and boys. It\u2019s a notion that the males are entitled to sexual gratification while females, let\u2019s just say they are only there to please their partners, which is stupid and preposterous.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nDo check out the complete review on my blog and share your thoughts.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#books #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #bookstoread #bookworm #bookwormread #bookish #booklovers #bibliophile #booknerd #bookhoarder #bookaddict #bookclub #bookaholic #bookcommunity #read #bookblogger #bookstagramindia #booksofinstagram #booklove #bookphotography #igbooks #igreads #instabooks #bookreviews #bookreviewer #booksonbooks #readingtime"

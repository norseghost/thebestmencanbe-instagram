I say \"I'm in here\"\n\nAfter my reply a 5 to 10 second pause,\n\nThen a series of 5 LOUD AZZ BANGS on the door.\n\nThen I pause, smile, and start playing a game \"What does the guy on the other side of the door look like?\" (Cause it could only be a guy #Stereotype)\n\nHe's probably 6' or taller,\n\nHe hits the gym a few times a month,\n\nProbably got a tattoo that he thinks makes him a bad ass,\n\nLol. I thought it was funny. He had no idea there was a giant on the other side of the door.\n\nHe was underestimating what was coming... Then I thought to myself: \"How many times have I underestimated or overestimated the person on the other side of the door or encounter.\" Answer: LOTS\n\nHow many times have I had it \"all figured out or knew it all\"\n\nHow many times have I thought they were \"too young or too old\"\n\nHow many times have I thought \"too short, too small, too smart\"\n\nHeres an idea...how about I use this as a powerful lesson to realize that I can change my way of being in EVERY situation.\n\nHow about I confront each interaction by just being open to possibility. \nHow about I dont underestimate or overestimate potential. \nJust be open to knowing that I have the internally sources tools to handle ANY encounter.\n\nThat realization adjusted my way of being almost instantly. It was a great lesson.\n\nSo back to the bathroom door... After the \"5 loud azz bangs\" honestly I waited, just to make him stir a bit. #ImALilBitPetty\n\nI opened the door... I look down at him... He looks up at me...scared shitless... Only thing I had wrong about his appearance was NOTHING! Lol\n\nHe looked at me and in his most pleasant voice he says \"How ya doin\" lol\n\nI said... \"Good\"\n\nHe looked scared, like he made a critical error in judgement. He was tense as if he didnt know how I would respond or what I would do. He looked like a guy who underestimated the person on the other side of the door.\n\nI just smiled. \nIt was a genuine smile.\n\nI was silently thanking him for the powerful lesson."

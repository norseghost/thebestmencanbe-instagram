#RelationshipTip

Fall in love with yourself!

It may sound counter intuitive, but one of the best ways to increase the passion within your relationship may be to find new ways to develop yourself outside of it. You can't feel love for someone else if you're feeling crappy about your own life.

Taking care of yourself will replenish you, making you more receptive to love in your life.

What are the unintended consequences of the #MeToo movement?
.
According to this @surveymonkey and @leaninorg survey..."Men in senior roles are pulling back from interacting with women at work, depriving them of the formal and informal mentorship that can aid in networking, securing new opportunities, and promotions."
.
“Sexual harassment is a loaded topic, but limiting interactions between male-and female-identifying employees isn’t the answer. Instead, updated policies, trainings, and guidance about appropriate behavior appear to be the most effective strategies for containing bad actors."
.
What's my take? This research shows we are at a tipping point.  A new world order is starting to take place and it’s making everyone - the holders of power and the those seeking power - uncomfortable.
.
The challenge is that we are focused on the wrong stuff. I'll continue to work on disrupting the imbalance of power and redirect focus on inequity, not on perpetuating the great divide.

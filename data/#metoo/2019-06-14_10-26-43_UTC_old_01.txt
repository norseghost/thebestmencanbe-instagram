For the Queens who always wait on people to fan their flames before they go on to do great things.

Cheer yourself on
Affirm yourself
Hype yourself
Pray for yourself
Empower yourself
Be yourself
Believe in yourself
Do your best.
Support Yourself.

Welcome the support of other people but don't rely on it, #DearQueen, please be your #1 Supporter so that disappointments, discouragements, distractions, naysayers etc will not weigh you down as you journey through life. // Art by @itsmaeril

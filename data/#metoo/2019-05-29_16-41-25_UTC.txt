Patriarchy will always find ways to regulate, control and police women’s bodies and sexuality. In this case, a religious sect of zealots and misogynists are forcing women in Indonesia to take ‘virginity’ tests to determine ‘moral’ character and chances of enlistment. I still don’t understand how having an ‘intact’ hymen correlates to defending your country. The invasive procedure involves a medic inserting two fingers into the vagina to determine ‘virginity’ which defies logic and science.This is the most disgusting form of discrimination,gender apartheid and character assassination. VIRGINITY IS A PATRIARCHAL SOCIAL CONSTRUCT! #politics #feminist #feminism #london #blogger #smashpatriarchy #justice #metoo #timesup

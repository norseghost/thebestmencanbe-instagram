Home is where the flowers are and a lamp from family sits serene, with an amber glow, upon the wood of the table made just for this space, a gift from the home itself, like the flowers she gave me, the woman whom I helped at an event yesterday featuring #ThisChangesEverything, a documentary that illustrates why lifting up women lifts up society and generates profit, improving the bottom line for projects in Hollywood and for us allâ€”thank you, #GeenaDavis, and thank you, #GDIGM. And by the way, your decor was fantastic. #WomeninHollywood #HomeSweetFlowers #floraldisplay #losfelizvintage #1920shome #losangeleskitchen #ilovela #littlearmenia #timesup #metoo #parityforwomen #equalrepresentationinhollywood #hollywood #documentary #eventslife #cinema #film #amberglow #bamboo #kitchensofinstagram #kitchendesign #summertime

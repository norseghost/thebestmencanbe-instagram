                        "text": "On this day in 2014, my father passed away alone in his apartment in Madera, CA. I was hesitant to check my FB today because of memories showing up, but I saw this from last year: on this day in 2018, I was intentionally at Disneyland in CA with my Seester and my niece. \u2764\ufe0f My spirit knew what I needed then.  My spirit knows what I need today. I am grieving and experiencing memory-based body pain in ways I haven\u2019t before on this day, so a breakthrough is coming. I will come out on the other side stronger and more clear on my purpose. I am finally allowing myself to grieve my father; not in a tiny box hidden in my heart\u2014 but my whole heart, in my entire body, with all of my spirit. Not for him, but for me. So I can say goodbye. So I can heal from everything that was done to me. I am sharing on this platform on a very painful day because I remember how reading about other people\u2019s experiences with grief helped me to see that I also have the right to grieve & process in all the ways that work for me. Ways that help me to get to the other side of pain, anger, fear, and heartbreak. I am still on that journey. Today is hard, no lie, but I will do more than survive it, dear reader. I will transcend it and move to a new level of healing so that next year it won\u2019t be so bad. I am on my way to therapy, which I scheduled intentionally for today, then off to my new place to move bins for the new shelving and cabinets being installed. \u2764\ufe0f Life continues; it is a river that I am choosing to float on today, not to drown. To live. To see what beauty I can see, to feel the wind in my face, to experience adventure and wonder. To pursue and achieve my dreams. Even today, I have goals and a task list to get through. I have a business to run. People to talk to. I will do it all, because I am Daniela Elena Capistrano. \ud83d\udc51\u2764\ufe0f #metoo #survivor"

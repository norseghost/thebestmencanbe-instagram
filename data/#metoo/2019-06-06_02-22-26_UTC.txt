I am really freakin proud of myself for this week. Last week my life was turned on its head. I felt lost and unmotivated, clueless on who I could trust, and like life as I knew it was over. This week, I have been redirecting that into positive energy - working out, spending time and making extra special plans with people who I KNOW have my best interest at heart, putting in my all at work, performing random acts of kindness (this experience has taught me you never know who needs it), and planning hikes and backpacking trips. What happened WILL affect my future relationships with people, and it DOES define me. HOW I choose to let it do those things is up to me and I am choosing to do it in a way that reflects recovery, strength, and happiness. I choose nature. I choose love. I choose forgiveness. I choose peace. I choose MY LIFE. Thank you all for your support and patience through this confusing time - much love to you ðŸ’œ

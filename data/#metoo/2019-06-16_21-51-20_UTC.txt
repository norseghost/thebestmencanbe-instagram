{REPOST ON YOUR STORY}~dear survivors:
I believe you,
It’s not your fault.
You are not alone. 
You are valid and so is your story. 
You can get through this. 
Together, we can fight this war 
And make a change towards
A world of equality where no one will have to say “me too” again.~

I just wanna day I’ve been in those shoes and I didn’t get justice for it but I don’t want it to be the same for anyone else or feel the same as I did. If you have a story please text me and it’ll be kept confidential. No one else will hear about it. I just want people to be heard. •

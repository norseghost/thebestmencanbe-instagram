It took me my entire life of failed relationships, deep hurt, and many do-overs to finally find a man who has done everything but hurt me. Everyday I canâ€™t believe I have someone in my life who protects me, who wants the best for me, who encourages me instead of sabotages me. I am forever thankful for him. #domesticviolence #abuse #narcissisticabuse #narcissist #domesticabuse #sociopath #emotionalabuse #mentalhealth #psychologicalabuse #sexualabuse #verbalabuse #gaslighting #survivor #trauma #toxicpeople #mentalhealthawareness #narc #suicideprevention #divorce #domesticviolenceawareness #metoo #endthestigma #stoptheviolence #fightorflight #narcawareness #endthesilence #suicidesurvivor #narcaware #quotes

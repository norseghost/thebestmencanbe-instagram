Even though I’ve been struggling with off and on knee pain from my surgery, I went on a 4 mile walk this AM on beach to see and admire the beauty of it.
I never feel alone when I’m there and if it wasn’t for the Lord, nearly 9 months ago now I would have been a goner and unable to see it. 
I do not need sympathy from anyone, just getting physically healthy again, educated and going after what I want in my life. No trauma or negative occurances in my life will ever hold me back from doing the things I want... and I’m starting to feel proud of myself, instead of feeling ashamed, for how much I truly am accomplishing, including walking the beach 💪🏼🌈

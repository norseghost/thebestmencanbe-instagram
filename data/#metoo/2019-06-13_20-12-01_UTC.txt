On Tuesday night, in London, I had a once in a lifetime opportunity of seeing what was probably Bikini Kill's last show.
An amazing trio called The Tuts opened up the show. These three girls are being sued for defamation by a well-known musician after going public about his misconduct and abuse towards ex-girlfriends and female musicians. No legal aid is available for defamation cases. The girls are crowdfunding a scarily expensive legal bill. T-shirt takings from the show went directly to their lawyers.
It was bittersweet after such a powerful evening of music and speeches from Tobi, Kathleen, The Tuts and Big Joannie to meet Nadia, Harriet and Beverley and hear firsthand about the toll of this lawsuit.
I have numerous friends here I've met through campaigns such as Repeal and work with FemSoc and of course a heap of musicians who champion respect and equality in the industry.
Attached is a link to pledge a donation towards the legal fees. These girls are a powerhouse of a band and a group that deserve to stick around a champion equality. Headlines about #MeToo can forget those who face a huge uphill battle without a mammoth platform to fall back on.
Huge love to these amazing girls.

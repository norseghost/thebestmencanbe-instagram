It is beyond disgusting and disrespectful to take the time out of your day and scream your ridiculous thoughts about such a sensitive topic to an innocent woman. Abortion is a serious, private matter, and no one should ever make someone making the choice to abort feel belittled and guilty. 
IF YOU ARE AGAINST ABORTIONS, DONâ€™T HAVE ONE. The process of a random person undergoing an abortion will not harm you yourself in any way. You do not know who that person is, what they have gone through and what they are currently going through, so refrain from forcing your harassing, religious comments onto them. -

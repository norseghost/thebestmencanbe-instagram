Another @buildaiduk cottage nearly completed at the @curefoundationph ranch in #cebu, #philippines. Thank you to all our donors and supporters that made this possible. 
This will be a home for 10 young girls rescued from sexual exploitation, where they’ll receive emotional, psychological and educational support for as long as they need.

@unicef has dubbed the Philippines as “the global epicenter of the live stream sexual abuse trade” and tens of thousands of children are believed to be involved in this child abuse industry worth $1 billion. 
Every child deserves to have a safe, secure home, free from abuse, where they can grow, learn, play and flourish. .

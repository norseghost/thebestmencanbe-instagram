The sun has set on the month of May and I am sitting in awe of my courage and my growing community. This month was a BIG one...
⠀
•I joined a Sacred Essence Sisterhood to support and nurture my growth. My intention is to heal the old wounds that say “it is not safe to trust women with my deepest vulnerability” and install a new belief rooted in the truth, “relationships with women are not only safe, they are an essential part of living fully.”
⠀
•I ran my first 5k to support Day One and their mission to end sexual violence. It was another layer of my healing because #metoo.
⠀
•We went on our first family vacation and was everything we needed. I thought we had to wait until I was working full-time. I thought travel was something I had to sacrifice to stay home with my kids. But you see, the Universe watches and when we say YES to ourselves the Universe follows our lead.
⠀
•I applied for a spot in The Author Incubator and I was accepted! With their support I’m writing a book to spread my message of hope and healing to be published in August!
⠀
•I courageously shared my story of resilience at an X-Factory event. For the first time I spoke publicly about my survival from a suicide attempt when I was 20 because #endthestigma. With the support of a truly beautiful circle of women I finally owned that my voice adds value to this world when I express it with love and authenticity.
⠀
•I participated in the #danceinmay2019 challenge put out by @youcandanceagain.  Everyday I danced and everyday I allowed my online community to witness this. It was exciting, vulnerable, daring and transformative.
⠀
•In all these things I grew my community of like hearted and like minded people. We weren’t meant to do this alone and finally I am embracing this fully.
⠀

I was able to accomplish ALL of this because I took myself through a process to become my own inner loving mother. I stopped outsourcing validation and became my own well of love and encouragement. If you need support to mother your dreams, message me ❤️

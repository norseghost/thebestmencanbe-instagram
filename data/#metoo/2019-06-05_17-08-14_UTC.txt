This reminds me of a time I traveled more than I do now. Do we forget to set goals for ourselves? Forgetting to set goals limits out experience in seeing that we can do the things we want and need. Have a bike? Go for a ride. Have rollerblades? Go rollerblading. Have money to buy a ticket to Japan? If that’s your dream, go. Don’t limit yourselves to those around you.

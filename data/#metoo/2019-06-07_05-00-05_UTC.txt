Another amazing @trapperschoepp show tonight! I really can't explain how much I love this man's music, story telling and that he is just a super rad human! His stories paint a vivid picture in my head and his music comes to life! That is a rare talent to have! I became an instant fan the first time I saw him and his brother perform. Thank you Trapper for sharing your talent and the bad ass hugs!!! As always...THANK YOU for being a voice for survivors of sexual assault. We need more men like you in this world! Doggie kisses to Ollie and you from the @ivanneenieandbros Monsterhouse! #numberonefan #wisconsin #onwisconsin #trapperschoepp #chicagomusic #guitar #storyteller #metoo #whatyoudidtoher #americana #rocknroll #rockandroll #concerts #harmonica #ontour #songwriter

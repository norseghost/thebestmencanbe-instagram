Long after the assault, after everyone else has gone home, you are left struggling to make sense of what happened. And in the aftermath of Jonathan's assault, I couldn't understand.

After all, he was my friend. 
And it was this, rather than the facts of what he did, that devastated me.

I guess I hadn’t taken my own oppression seriously. I had believed Jonathan’s misogyny was just a flaw, one that we could work around. One we could fix. I hadn't understood that there was no fixing it. At least not with my help. It didn’t matter what I said since I would always be the one saying it. Me. Female. 
There would never be a time that I would be able to step out of my gender or sex and just be heard as human. Misogyny, like racism, is in the very air we breathe. It’s in our early readers and coloring books and Disney films and Saturday morning cartoons. And Jonathan had worn those lenses for so long that the tint they gave to everything had become, for him, the shade that the world really was. He had never truly seen me at all.

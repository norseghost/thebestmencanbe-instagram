Had a late one last night, got to bed well after midnight, just had to finish #thesilenceofthegirls ........................... ... what was the hurry? A fellow reader friend is calling by later and I think she'll enjoy it. Well, I hope she does because I'm wrecked today 😅 .................................................................... As a child I read Greek myths and legends, but I don't really know a lot about that period in history, even though now, as an adult, gI read a lot of historical novels. I love, for example, #traceychevalier and her exquisitely researched work. I'll read anything about 16th and 17th century Tudor / Elisabethan times. I recently read #theseaofpoppies and found it to be not just a cracking good story, but historically very informative. So, what did I learn from #patbarker and her Greek / Trojan research and subsequent novel? I've thought about this all morning and challenged myself to give a one-liner review, here goes: ...................................................................... °°°°°°°°° Pat Barker has flipped the historic mirror on traditional storytelling of the nine year war to sack the City of Troy, offering instead a #metoo version of what has, until now, been a male discourse.
°°°°°°°°°° (See? One line! A long one, I agree, but it's the best I could do given the sleep deprivation 😴) ........................... You're welcome 🤗 ......................................................................... Great story, easy reading, good pace, no holds barred, cracking good reading material ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ .............................................................. #thesilenceofthegirls #patbarker #penguin #randomhouse #book #books #booksofinstagram #read #readersofinstagram #readers #bookreview #writers #writersofinstagram #bookclub #goodchoice #historicalnovel #greeks #trojans #womensperspective #readersgottaread #writersgottawrite #gratitude #takenothingforgranted

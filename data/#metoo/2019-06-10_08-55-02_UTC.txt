Bodyscape -
-
This lady stands just over a metre tall, the biggest thing I have ever made. I wanted to create something with a physical presence that demanded attention. Where words fail, I use clay to communicate and explore the unprocessed trauma of sexual assault. There is an underlying playfulness about Bodyscape; a personal coping mechanism and an attempt at bodily reclamation. -

Using art as a conversational tool, I hope to facilitate and participate in social change- removing the stigma that comes with being a victim of sexual assault. •

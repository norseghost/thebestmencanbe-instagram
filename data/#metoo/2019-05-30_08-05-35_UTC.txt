TW: sexual assault, rape
.
.
But there was nothing that I could have done.
His grip was power.
His body a thunder.
His touch was evil.
I had to give in , 
The pain ,
The shame ,
The trauma,
The violation of such dept.
My soul is shattered .
A caged slave in a body which is no more familiar.
Often , That soul of mine .
Questions , what was thy fault ?
I close my eyes and whisper in the echoes of the night.
LOVE. ~NT
The survivor. .

Why do strange men think it's ok to touch me? Why do any strangers still think it's ok to intimately touch any other strangers? Did we all learn nothing from the whole #metoo movement a while back? Why is it that I find my lips forming that oft-told lie, "I have a boyfriend"? Is it because I know the threat of a man, one not even present, is stronger than my own protestations of "don't touch me" or the ever-ignored "NO"? Is it the way I was dressed; appropriately yet comfortably for dancing in a hot, crowded space? Is it my simple presence here, as a lone woman, in a public arena that makes you think it's ok? Is it my turning/pushing AWAY from you as you grab me and try to kiss my neck that somehow screams "yeah. I'm enjoying this"? Please, let me know what I'm doing wrong, because I just want it to stop. I'm just here to enjoy the music and dance. .

Anyways, here's some photos from a beautiful hike I went on last year. My happy space, safe. How do I feel safe in that isolation? Well, it's because Arizona has some very lax guns laws. And the desert is full of places someone could disappear without a trace, even a predator. ðŸ™ƒðŸŒµðŸ¦‚ .

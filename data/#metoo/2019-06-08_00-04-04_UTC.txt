What I’ve come to learn in the teaching profession is that it’s impossible to do it on your own. Behind every teacher is a group of people who have supported them in one way or another and I am so thankful for my tribe who stands with me!
But just like C.S. Lewis, I’ve come to learn the power behind the words “me too”. There are some things that people outside this profession will never understand and it can be hard to share all of your thoughts, worries and ideas with people that aren’t teachers. I’m so blessed to work with such amazingly talented people in my profession who are going through the same trials and tribulations as me! 
So...if you ever feel overwhelmed, along, tired, frustrated or lost...remember that there is a teacher out there who can probably say, “me too!”

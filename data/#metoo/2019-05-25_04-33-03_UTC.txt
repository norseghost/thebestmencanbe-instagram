Today is World Schizophrenia Day.  It is also Mental Health Awareness Month.  My life have been touched by someone who has schizophrenia.  Some studies shows schizophrenia caused by chemical imbalance in the brain and environmental elements.  Some symptoms may include anxiety, fatigue, hallucinations and hostility.  Please see a professional if you are exhibiting any symptoms.  My heart goes out to all who have been affected by #schizophrenia, both survivors and loved ones. ðŸ’š #worldschizophreniaday #removethestigma #mentalhealthawarenessmonth @imachildabusesurvivor

With 1 in 3 women impacted by violence and harassment in the world of work, itâ€™s time to act. And we did! 
Over 2157 Australians, and over 20,000 people internationally, have signed the petition calling on our governments to support a new international law to end violence and harassment at work.

We just sent this petition to the Minister for Industrial Relations @christianportermp calling on him to take action. 
Next week, governments, unions, and employers will meet at the International Labour Conference in Geneva to vote on this convention. We must keep the pressure on the Australian Government to pledge their support. #AllWomenWork

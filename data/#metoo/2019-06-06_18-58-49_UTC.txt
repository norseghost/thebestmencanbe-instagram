Novak-Sandner 2019 Family Reading Challenge No. 20: Read a comic book (graphic novel) adaptation of a book. Laurie Halse Andersonand Emily Carroll's adaptation of Anderson's 1999 debut novel is stunning. The graphic form adds additional layers to the story of a teenager raped at a party. The relevance of thia 2018 adaptation is a reminder of juat how little has changed in 20 years. #metoo #Novakandsandnerread2019 #yalit

Why so serious? Wait, what? The show opens this weekend? Yeah, we’d say that’s pretty serious. 
We still have a few tickets available for our opening night, which is 6:00pm this Friday, as well as for our Sunday evening show at 7. Both shows are pay-what-you-can, so don’t miss the chance to get the best possible deal on tickets for #TheMasher2019!

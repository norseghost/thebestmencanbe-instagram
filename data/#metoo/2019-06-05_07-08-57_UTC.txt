So I’m posting this late, but this moment could never be lost, which is why I must share it. This was from a client of mine that I’m no longer training because of the circumstances of life. These ever changing moments can promote one to think there is no purpose to lead with the intention to connect with other people, or even something so simple like the ideal that the little things don’t matter; however, it’s quite the opposite...every moment counts, and every connection to another person matters! This lesson could be what to do or what not to do, but both should lead to growth.  My point, I’m getting there I promise🤞 is that I have heard great things about myself 🤗 and I’ve also, surprisingly of course,😉 heard bad thing about myself, which ultimately leads me to self-reflection,🤔 which leads to accountability😔, which leads to acceptance🤭, which leads me to growth💪. Simple!! Do Better!! See Better! Hear Better! Listen Better! Know Better! Act Better! Love Better! Hurt Better! Respond Better! React Better! Want Better! Treat Better! Expect Better! By the way you must do it with no expectation of return, and do it when no one is looking.👀 Behave in a way that honors who you are and command that people do the same👊 I’m so honored to have the ability to connect with people and be a positive influence in creating change that promotes the empowerment of women😋❤️

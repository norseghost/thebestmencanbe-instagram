When the time comes and it’ll come. No won’t matter. You’ll have a choice you can Scream, yell, beg, plead for him to stop, Or you can fight like hell. You fight for every women who had their voice stripped away. Who got blamed for a man not being able to accept no for an answer. You fight for the women, who never had a say. Who never had a choice. For every day we get hollered at walk to our car, for every time a man thought we were at the gym for him. You stand up and you fight for the rights to your own body. No means fucking no, and this time I’ll be damned if I’m not ready.

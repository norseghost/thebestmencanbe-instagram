Even if last night had it's own way of doing things, the way you are will never change. You're beautiful and powerful. You're more than this competition and you're bound to do greater things. Being a true advocate by heart already makes you a queen. And your golden heart is your crown. We salute you, @denjmagno! You inspire us. ❤👏👏 •

                        "text": "Rapunzel\u2019s Escape. Oil on canvas, 2019. As a young woman, my desire and eros were not protected. My relationship myself, my expression, my wanting, and my needs to be seen and reflected were interrupted.  I was intruded upon in ways I was not prepared for. \nSome part of me believed my wanting did it. And if I could imprison my wanting, high in the narrowest of towers, fed rations of momentary wonder, I would theoretically be safe. \nGiven this was really the only thing I could do to change my experience of the situation, I am grateful; albeit, I suffered. (Survivors who self-blame have statistically higher prognoses. Why? We dilute the poison of the trauma, eliminating the demon of helplessness... *until a later time when that demon may be overcome; not alone, an unresourced one, but together, an equipped for battle two. This is one of the beauties of psychotherapy). I paint from my unconscious. I allow something to emerge; one might say, I channel. I don\u2019t think about what\u2019s coming. I allow. \nI shared this painting with my therapist, who told me the story of Rapunzel, daughter of id (her mother) who wanted the delicious rampions of the garden, and ego (her father) who reluctantly conspired, was cast to the tower by the witch (self-controlling super ego). Classic fairytales, when received as intrapersonal symbolism, help us to understand this perplexing experience of being human, to survive suffering and trauma. We often get caught up in the gender roles of them, but they\u2019re actually irrelevant as they all represent parts of the self; a self of any gender.  So, at the end of the story, by way of tears, Rapunzel is healed and reintegrated into the ecosystem of belonging as she enters the wilderness. What does it mean, symbolically speaking, to (re?)-enter our wilderness?  This is what I am learning about today. \nThank you for receiving my story. I would love to hear your thoughts.  #metoo #feminist #trauma #expressiveartstherapy #rapunzel #woundedhealer #oilpainting #painting #theheroinesjourney #mythology #psychotherapy #soulful #queerwomen #healingtrauma #artistmama #josephcampbell #jungian #art #intuitivepainting #wilderness #bravingthewilderne"

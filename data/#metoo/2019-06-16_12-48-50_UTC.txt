WE'RE SORRY! Have another Â£5 off on us...
.
Oh the pitfalls of technology...
or rather, the pitfalls of not being particularly tech savvy!
.
We've had several messages from perplexed members of the community wondering how exactly they purchase a place on When Women Rebel, when the link seemed intent on taking them round and round some kind of cyber maze with no way out ðŸ˜±
.
What an anticlimax after our big extravagant announcement! And we're genuinely sorry if you were one of those who got stuck in the maze of pixels.
.
That's why we're offering another Â£5 off for the next 48 hours- head to the bio to grab yours. Everything should now be present and correct once you follow 'sign me up' and an email will whizz it's way straight over with details of the Facebook group.
.
Any more issues please do let us know, either on our social pages or by hitting reply to any of our emails.
.
Love Nicola and Sara xxx

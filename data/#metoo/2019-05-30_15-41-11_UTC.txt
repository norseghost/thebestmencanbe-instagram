I’ve worked with so many women who have never raised their voice above a “polite request” setting. They don’t know the full power of their own voice until they stand up and push it out! 
Remember this when you feel alone and need courage: every time we speak up for ourselves we’re speaking up for all women. 
Anger can be productive, not just destructive. And there’s so much to be angry about!! We can use our rage to make change: call, email, sign petitions, use hashtags, rally, march, write, speak and yell.  Do it now!

Some orgs I speak up for with my time and money are @ppact @prochoicewashington @aclu_nationwide @workingwashington

Sections from the #monumentquilt featuring stories of #genderbasedviolence will be displayed on the #nationalmall in Washington DC this weekend. The quilt tells the story of 3000 peoples experience with sexual and domestic violence. Reminds me of the #aidsquilt I grew up with and the need to stand and be seen —all people, together #stopthehate #stoptheviolenceagainstwomen #stopviolenceagainstwomen #womensrights #lgbtrights #blacklivesmatter “ until we are strong together, we are strongly alone.” #metoo

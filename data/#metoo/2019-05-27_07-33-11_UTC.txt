When actress Emma Watson made her landmark HeForShe speech entreating men “to take up the mantle” of women’s rights at the United Nations last September, she eclipsed another woman who took the podium earlier that day. A woman who is responsible for defending the rights of more than half the world’s population – but of whom most people have never heard.

Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the head of UN Women and former deputy president of South Africa, knows a little more about worldwide gender inequality than the former Harry Potter star, but she is relaxed about letting Watson take the limelight. • “There are lots of people who do not care what I have to say because I’m one of the usual suspects,” she says modestly. “Also, I just don’t have that reach. People who follow me are more or less the converted. But when you have someone with a captive audience, especially a youth audience, you reach out to new people.” With domestic violence, she says, no country can sit on its laurels. “The home is the unsafest place for a woman to be. In most countries where we have laws against violence against women it does not mean these laws are being implemented.” Using the principles of the HeForShe campaign, Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka knows that women cannot solve the problem alone. “It’s important to work with men and boys in every home and every community so you’re fighting this behaviour.” She is the second head of UN Women, the international body’s newest department. It launched in 2010 with the former Chilean president, Michelle Bachelet, taking the helm for the first four-year term.

Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka was born in Durban, South Africa, in 1955, and trained as a teacher before turning to politics. As deputy president to Thabo Mbeki, she was the most senior female politician in South African history. But her political career came to an abrupt halt when Jacob Zuma took over the presidency.

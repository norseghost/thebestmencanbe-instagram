cw: sexual violence mention
.
last month I had the opportunity to return to @resolve_hk's fellowship workshop as an alumni to talk about my own experiences with sexual violence. it's the first time I've spoken to a crowd this size and spoken in such depth about my experiences. (if you look closely I'm holding my fidget cube bc I was anxious as heck.)
.
47% of trans and gender non confirming people experience sexual assault in their lifetime.
.
we need to stop framing the conversation about sexual violence around cis women/ straight people. we need to talk about sexual violence within the SOGIESC community. we need to believe survivors who aren't your "gold star victims." survivors who are sexually active, who are sex workers, who are queer and trans, who aren't "attractive" by eurocentric ideas of beauty, who are immigrants, who are disabled.
.
the list is non exhaustive. my point is we need to open up the conversation around sexual violence. but first of all we need to START talking about it.

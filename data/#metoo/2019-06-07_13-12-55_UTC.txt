This is my big ginger boy, and this is me touching his belly and his peats and beans. This is the first time i have ever been able to do this. He is seven. This is momentous. I am so proud of him <3 This fatty chonk is my stray boy who just turned up one day. I saw him running through the front yard and quick as a whip I put a bowl of biskies out. He came back. And he kept coming back. It took months before I was able to touch him. He went through puberty before I was able to give him the snip. He got real beefy, now he looks a soggy ex weight lifter. When we lived with my ex he was stressed and anxious. My ex would do things he hated constantly. He would pick him up and turn him upside down every time he wanted to go outside. Smee had a panic attack everytime he was picked up like this. It got to the point where he would get stressed and hiss whenever he wanted to go out. My ex's reasoning was "he should learn to like it". He was abusive, he liked control, and it extended to the cats. He would not stop doing this even though I asked. It's now been about seven months since he finally left and the changes in the cats has been dramatic. Basil is much less of a jerk and barely acts out, Pink is much more relaxed and affectionate, and Smee is less anxious. I watch his confidence grow every day. And here he is utterly relaxed on my lap, with a smile on his face while I touch his toe beans when just a few months ago he would hiss if someone tried to pick him up. DV has affected us all. I loves him <3 ðŸ˜º #brave #bravecat #healing #smeethecat #survivor #domesticviolence #enoughisenough #metoo #rescuecat #catsofinstagram #catgram #gingercat #toebeans #pinktoebeans #catlife #mystory #ourstory #recovery #recoveryispossible  #chronicillnesswarrior #trust #chonk

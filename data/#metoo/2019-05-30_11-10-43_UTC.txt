Let’s talk about H&M’s latest ‘Conscious Collection’. This Spring line uses sustainably-sourced materials, like organic cotton, Tencel + recycled polyester, and is intended as a statement of intent to take responsibility + lead change towards a sustainable fashion industry. I will also mention here that the multinational is also being much (like MUCH) more transparent about their supply chains + overall footprint, which is great. Kudos.
.
So while I applaud the above I also have to be 100% f__king real + say that this is most definitely only half the story. The fact remains that H&M are *still* producing clothes at warp speed + consumers are still manically buying them, wearing them twice, then chucking them into landfill at astonishing rates. This is not consciousness - this is capitalism.
.
I am not here to bash H&M. Not at all. I am here to remain aware + follow my core values. Supporting ethical fashion is not a trend. Period. Much like advocating for POC is not a trend - preaching a clean lifestyle is not a trend - endorsing LGBTQIA+ is not a trend. These things are about an ongoing commitment to a lifestyle based on a set of values for people + planet; about common decency + empathy; about minimising the disastrous environmental + humanitarian effects of unconscious consumerism; and about knowing how our political beliefs have a direct effect on other people’s livelihoods. That is being conscious. That is not a Spring line collection.
.
So while I am somewhat shitty at the barrage of greenwashers exploiting humanity’s *hopefully* new found interest in doing the right thing, I also know there is a silver lining here. And that silver lining is you guys.
.
Some of you reading this right now are already extremely conscious citizens + some of you are newer to the concept, yet trying so hard every day! And then there’s some of you completely new to my grid, trying for change + this makes me v happy. I hope you stick around.
.
Being a #ConsciousCitizen is listening, learning, growing. It’s about being perceptive people in an expeditious era. So let’s do this shit together + recognise our responsibility to live a conscious life, both of body + mind.
.
Peace out! X

9th Sept - 9th June. 
For me it's +9 months away from #narcissisticabuse 🎗❤ Yay!
We can save ourselves. If we're strong enough to stay in a toxic and abusive environment, we're strong enough to leave it.
We can walk away. How? On our two feet and without looking back.
We have to go No Contact as soon as we can. 
Nobody deserves abuse. Aren't you worthy of happiness ? Be kind and patient with yourself, but be strict too. It's time to heal 🌹

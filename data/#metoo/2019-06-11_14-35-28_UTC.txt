"Emotional health is very importantâ€”especially when youâ€™ve joined the circus, like I have.

You need to take a breath and to take time away. Iâ€™m not about a spa day. God bless all the people that have given me spa gift certificates because theyâ€™re stacked in my office drawer. I love a staycation.

I like the quiet and being with my own thoughts and watching a movie and recharging. Itâ€™s good for your mental health to leave the world out there for a minute and just keep quiet."- #GinaTorres for @Healthmagazine ðŸ’–

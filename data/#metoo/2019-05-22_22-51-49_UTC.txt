“so i’m 13 and I live in a place where we have a gas station a block away. I usually walk there to get snacks or sodas for me and my family. when i was walking there this time though there was this one truck that kept passing me, that of course had me a bit on edge. Then I got to the crosswalk and had to wait for the cars to stop. then the truck pulled up and stopped. He was at least 40 years old and he still thought it was a good idea to come up to me. anyway he yelled out of his window “Daaamn girl.” i’d been catcalled before but never by someone over double my age. ashamed and scared i kept going and on the way back he passed by me again and wolf whistled at me. I then took my phone out ready to call the police if needed. I was terrified and blamed it on me wearing short shorts.  I don’t know why I thought that but i did.  got home and pretty much cried in my room. I have only recently started getting catcalled and it’s very scary to me.” - anonymous

whoever knew? This girl form Rhode island will be nominated to set on Disabled American Veterans Chapter 41 executive committee. I am honored that I am able to continue to serve, those who have gone before me, people I severed with and those who will stand the watch after me. Until every veteran, dependent and spouse receives the benefits they earned and are aware of all the resources available to them. Our mission is not DONE and therefore we will not stop until our mission is completed. If you need help or know a vet who does DM me

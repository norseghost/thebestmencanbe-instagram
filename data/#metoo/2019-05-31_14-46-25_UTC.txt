Part 2 (English Follows Japanese)
電車の女性専用車両は一時のしのぎでしかない。それがあると安心できる人がいるのかは知らないけれど、女性だってほかの女性に痴漢する場合はある—様々な性的指向があるから。通報を促すポスターを見かけるが、痴漢されたことを告白したい人はあまりいないと思う。痴漢を無くすためには、もっと対策が必要だ。長期にわたって、例えば、加害者は女性の問題に注目した社会奉仕活動をするとか。痴漢をされることはトラウマになってもおかしくない。加害者に教養を与え、被害者はどんな気持ちになるか理解させなくてはならない。一日牢屋に入れるだけでは何も解決されない。これは日本にしかない問題だから、私たちがアクションを起こさなくてはならない。今のままでは、不十分だ。

The women only cars on trains are just a temporary fix. I don’t know if people feel safer by having it, but women can grope other women too – there’s different sexual orientations. I see posters saying people should report it, but I don’t think many people want to admit they were groped or have the willingness to do so. In order to for it to stop, we have to take it further. There should be long-term repercussions: perpetrators should be forced to do some community service where they volunteer for a community that focuses on women’s issues. Cause getting groped can be traumatizing, you know? They need to be educated to understand how victimizing it feels. Putting them in jail for a day just isn’t going to solve anything. Since this is a problem unique to Japan, I feel like we need to take bigger actions. Right now, it’s just not enough. -Anonymous 📸: @tobeprecise 📝: @mishadesu

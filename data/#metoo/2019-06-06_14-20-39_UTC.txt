A friend shared this information this morning. This...I canâ€™t even place into words really such shame I have of what this country has become. Especially since I gave several years of my life to protect this country when I served in the Army. As a female Army veteran to just see this. The pride I had for my country has diminished and in its place, disappointment. America is supposed to stand for something. This country was supposed to be progressive, it was meant to pride hope and security. My naivety has blinded me for some many years in my joie de vivre that the US is great. How we are raised to think we are #1. Pledging allegiance to a county every morning as a child. Saluting a flag morning and night as a solider. Just to have the reality of how far gone this country has become. A friend of mine shown me this today and I can just say now with a heavy heart. We need to wake up from the societal delusion of the grandiose nature in which many believe America to be. We are not living the American dream but a nightmare. #womensrights #whiteprivilege #humanrights #metoo #women #womenempowerment #wakeupamerica #makeachange #veteran #army

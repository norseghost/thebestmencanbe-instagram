How many of these have you heard? These and so many others. Looking from the outside it seems ridiculous that we'd believe this crap. That just dismisses us and our abuse which makes us feel unworthy and not believed. Survivors need to be heard, believed, and supported. If not, we won't seek help and we will continue to suffer and may end up back with the abuser.

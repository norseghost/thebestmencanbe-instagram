“Only the wounded can serve. Without your pain where would your source of power be?”
.
👆A woman who was practically a stranger spoke these words over me years ago. Without saying a word and without explaining myself or my particularly painful circumstances at the time, this woman saw right to my soul. Those were her exact words and I have carried them with me through numerous difficult seasons and dark times. Those words immediately gave my struggles and the things that hurt so deeply an immediate purpose.  And it’s a good reminder that I often forget...not to feel defeated in failure...not to let falling down define me, but to rather get back up again, and again, and again. Never stop picking myself up. .

And time does heal. It gives us distance and perspective if we are willing to. .
...and I can’t say every day is easy, but today and most days I’m thankful for the struggles. I can see God’s hand in it all because I don’t know who I would be without my wounds. Without grace and love guiding me through the darkest of storms. “Consider it all joy...” -James 1:5

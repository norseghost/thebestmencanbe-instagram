🍻 Who’s having a few drinks this Saturday night?! It’s ridiculous that the world has deemed certain drinks ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’?! 🍺 Pints with the lads...
🍸 Cocktails with the girls right... It’s a drink!! I don’t think any of us need any more pressure in our lives, let alone being judged by our bar order 👎

So ladies, enjoy that pint if you fancy it. Guys, hit that pink cocktail you love. Have a fabulous night being wonderfully you 👌

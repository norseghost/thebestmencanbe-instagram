                        "text": "I was held against my will for two months in Kashmir. Near the Pakistan border. It is a very \ndangerous place. During that time, I was continuously sexually and physically assaulted. Shortly after \nmy return, I was led to believe, by someone that I looked up to at the time, that everything was all \nmy own fault. \nThis is why it became extremely difficult for me to talk about for so many years. It is also why I found \nit hard to go to court and have these two men put away for life. I was told by the embassy that if I \nwent to court, this is what will happen to these men. I actually thought at the time, \u201chow can I \npunish these men for something that I had let happen to me?\u201d!!! Can you believe that?! If only I \ncould go back in time and shake myself a little gently and tell my younger self that what they did to \nme was on them not me! \nI held everything in and kept it private. I hid myself away from the world and I silently punished \nmyself for fifteen years without even knowing it.\r\nAfter writing my memoir, getting everything out and clearing everything up, I\u2019m now on the path of \nputting the pieces back together that I had destroyed due to guilt, anger and fear towards myself.\r\nI finally feel free to be open about my story and this is why I\u2019m so excited to be sharing the whole, \u2018uncut\u2019, full-disclosure version of how all of this came about in my life and how it has rendered gifts \nso powerful that now I\u2019d never want to change a thing.\r\nI am so excited to be soon releasing my memoir A Dangerous Pursuit to Happiness. \n#metoo #survivor #strength #healing #recovery #blackdog #blessings #freedom #commitment #compassion #forgiveness #unconditionallove #lightworker #digdeep #keepgoing #livefully #selflove #determination #mystory #courage #peace #faith #wisewomen #grace #faith #abundance #love #change #bliss #truth #writerslife"

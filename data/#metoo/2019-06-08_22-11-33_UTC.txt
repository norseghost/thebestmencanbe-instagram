It was a day full of uphills, downhills, and everything in between with @mikek3131. We chatted about the importance of the #metoomovement and discussed the power of these narratives after listening to a This American Life podcast episode together. Memories live with us y’all... I’m challenging myself to share my own #metoo stories and not feel ashamed with my story. Now we have bellies full of dim sum and soon to be yummy cheesecakes and Ube cookies from @hoodfamousbakeshop! 😍😍😍

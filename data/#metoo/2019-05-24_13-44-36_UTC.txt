During the time I took this picture last year, I still lived in Indiana but I took my daughters to the Essence Festival in New Orleans in 2018. I made the decision that day that I was moving to NOLA and literally dropped everything, packed documents and clothes and moved two weeks later. Not many people know this, but during the time of this picture I was a victim of Domestic Violence. On my next podcast, episode 12- Freedom from Domestic Violence you will hear about the violence I endured physically, financially and at times sexually. I’m not embarrassed because I got out. I found freedom for me and my children in New Orleans and I documented my journey in the upcoming podcast that will be released this Tuesday at noon CST. Please download the Anchor app and make sure to tell others as well to tune in because this is a EPIDEMIC in our culture/communities and if I have to be transparent to save a life......well, that’s what I’m going to do‼️👌🏽❤️💯 #ihatedomesticviolence #metoo #authenticity #mompreneur #podcast #neworleans #louisiana #indiana #fortwayne #chicago #business #startup #culture #blackwomen #enough

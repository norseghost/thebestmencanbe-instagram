ARE YOU WARY? #metoo
----
It's been 18 months since the #metoo movement hit social media and it's popularity has slowed down alot since its initial onslaught.

Yet whilst the movement has slowed, the reality of living with #metoo certainly hasn't. The threat continues and I personally find myself still being wary of men on a regular basis. I had a brutal reminder of this on a recent overseas work trip where yet again I was faced with unwanted advances and had my personal boundaries forcibly (and physically) breached by a "friend" in the back of an uber.

I'd forgotten about #metoo until then and I raise this now because a good male friend of mine regularly says "Me too....but not that me too" in chat. I laugh knowing that it’s his way of saying that he's not a threat. Truth be told, I've never considered him as one. Quite the opposite in fact...he was unknowingly there for me ‘that night’ as someone whom I felt safe with despite these "friends" pressuring me to "walk me back to my room". (I've never thanked him for that but maybe this post is a way of quietly doing so). It's sad though that #metoo was and continues to be an issue. And even sadder that my friend feels the need to clarify his words/behaviour because of those who cannot.

I go away alone again in 2 weeks time. Will I be wary? Absolutely! Yet this will not stop me living my best life and I refuse to allow this social issue to hold me back from opportunity. 
I’ll be honest though, whilst I’m excited there is still that little twinge of worry and wariness about this trip as I again prepare to face yet another potential #metoo situation.

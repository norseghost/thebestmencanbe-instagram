Yo, yo, yo, here we go! DID that for opening weekend, and now SANCTIONS is back for week two + ready for the rest of the run. Come check out this awesome show about sports, college athletes, how rules get bent, well intentioned students get hurt, race, money, assault, politics, and so many other things addresed in this play. As a huge football fan and a zero tolerance policy person for any "cultural insensitivity" (as my character calls it lol) especially in education, I was meant to play this role. Word to Colin Kaepernick @kaepernick7 on my shirt lol my cast is fierce and our crew and design teams have been ON POINT. Come check us!! Running May 5 - June 15, 2019. 🙌🏾💖🏈💰 .

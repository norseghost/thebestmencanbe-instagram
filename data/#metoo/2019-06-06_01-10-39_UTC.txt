....SO THIS HAPPENED:
After Gov. Greg Abbott signed the bills into law it is custom to give each author of the bill the pen which has his signature on it...
Well,  there was this Queen👸 seated at the table named 👸 Victoria Neave,  and when she was given her pen for spearheading #HB8 #THELAVINIAMASTERSACT, she stood up and gave honor to the Governor. then told him that she wanted me, 👸 Lavinia B. Masters to have her pen. He then gave his blessing and she handed her pen off to me 😭😭😭😭
I was already humbled & honored for her to attach her law with my name but to give me her memorable piece of history of this great day... was more than LIFE to me ❤❤❤
Therefore I will forever cherish this pen and the newspaper article that Dallas Morning News written today because the photo on the front page of today's paper captures the sisterhood embrace we shared when she passed off her pen. 💃
I pray that even when I am no longer on this earth that the walls of the Texas State Capitol will reserve a space for such priceless memories that I have in my possession today 🙏
JUNE 4TH 2019 IS A GREAT DAY OF MEMORIES FOR ME AS I WAS BLESSED TO ENCOUNTER ANOTHER QUEEN👸 THAT WAS NOT AFRAID TO STRAIGHTEN MY CROWN👸 BUT I ALSO WITNESSED MY GOVERNOR SUPPORT AND SPEAK UP FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN MY BIRTH STATE & I HAD MY KING RIGHT BY MY SIDE, JUST LIKE HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN, TO NOT ONLY SUPPORT ME BUT CELEBRATE WITH ME 🙏🙏❤❤ #HB8 #SEXUALASSAULTSURVIVOR #thelaviniamastersact #VICTORIANEAVE #METOO #rapesurvivor #mentalhealthawareness #K104FM @dedeinthemorning @newfriendsnewlife @victoria4texas #blacklove #blackgirlmagic #blackgirlsrock #blackpanther #laviniaspeaks

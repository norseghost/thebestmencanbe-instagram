Read Theresa and Jennifer's full statement and consider donating at RISEslo.org (link in bio) to support local survivors:
.
"The #MeToo movement has opened the doors for local survivors to come forward and seek the support they deserve. That growing need has impacted the RISE crisis hotline. In 2017 we received 979 total crisis calls. In 2018, the year after the #MeToo movement gained national attention, that number increased to 1,469 calls.
.
"Survivors who stayed silent for decades are now reaching out for help, and survivors who were recently victimized now feel more comfortable coming forward.
.
"Our counseling services have also seen an increase in demand. In the last year we have hired several new therapists, but our average wait time to see a counselor is still 3 months. We currently have over 140 survivors on our waitlist, and not being able to talk to a therapist in a timely manner can be very discouraging."
.
You can help support these life-changing services for survivors. Your donation today at RISEslo.org will go directly to services like the 24-hour crisis line and counseling services.

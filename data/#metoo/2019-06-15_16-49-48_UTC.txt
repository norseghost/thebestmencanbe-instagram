My friend from YTT is teaching tomorrow.  For a beautiful cause! Side note, she totally had my back today at class when I ran into a couple things that threw me off.  Your amazing Tizzy Bell. I guess no matter how confident and happy we are to do something new, we will find moments that are awkward. I had fun and I hope the class did too. See you in the morning at class?? #nonviolence #unrollyourmat #lookatyougo #metoo

No one can tell me what I can and cannot do with my body. You don't know my circumstances, you don't know my life. The men that cannot give birth should not be telling us what we can and cannot do with our own bodies. They are just deadset on taking everything away from us. You know what though? I'm a fighter! I will not sit idly by while you take my freedoms away from me.

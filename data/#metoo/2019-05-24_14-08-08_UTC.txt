Reason 9️⃣ that we need more full-time #TitleIX Coordinators. ⁣

TODAY we are joining our Harassment Free Working Group partners at the NY State Sexual Assault Hearing. The hearing is focused on workplace sexual harassment and schools are the workplaces of young people. Unlike adults, students are mandated to go to work, which is often the site where they have experienced harm. We will be centering the stories of youth organizers and survivors today as we support survivor-centered legislation. Follow us on Twitter (@ggenyc) for real-time updates. ⁣

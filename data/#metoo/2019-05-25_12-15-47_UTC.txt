Tanmay Bhat, former CEO of AIB apologised to his team mates, friends and family. He said he had failed as a leader and feels sorry for it. During the #MeToo movement in October, Khamba from AIB was alleged for sexual harassment. Along with this AIB was involved in several controversies. Tanmay’s suspension has been lifted and he says that if further in life he ever seeks a leadership position, he would strive to make women feel ‘safe’ in that environment. As a leader there are several decisions one has to make and many they are answerable to, at least Tanmay has taken a step to make up for the mishap.

For decades, black women were barred from #MissAmerica contests. Last week, for the first time, black women wore the crowns of all three major American pageants simultaneously. Cheslie Kryst, 28, won the Miss USA contest, and Kaliegh Garris, 18, won Miss Teen USA — joining Nia Franklin, 25, who was crowned as the 2019 in September. The three wins are a powerful symbol of how much American views on beauty have evolved from a past marred by racism, even as some question the role that beauty pageants have in a #MeToo world at all. “It is important to little brown and black girls to see three strong figures, three strong women, African-American women that are doing so much great work,” Nia Franklin said on Saturday. 👑 Pictured here: | 📸: Jason Bean/The Reno Gazette-Journal, via Associated Press; Miss Teen USA

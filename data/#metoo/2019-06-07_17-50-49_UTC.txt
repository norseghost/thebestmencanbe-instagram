And coz of principals like him  Principal Temesghen Asmerom at Emmett J. Conrad High School in Dallas, Texas, we have discrimination, hate crimes, and killing. Him being person of color to do what he did is below low.  I am sorry to his victim  Rooha Haghar's  who is  female trying to say the  speech she works on, pur get heart into it. How can you be an educator and example for students who are the future and act like this. Disgrace and shame on you. You make us the educators look bad. I pray for you. If he still has some humility and dignity left in him, please resign for your discriminatory action against freedom of speech, against the rights and freedom. Please repost this post. Is not ok to let the discrimination from the authorities be supported without any actions taken. Actions speak volumes. Once again this person name is: Principal Temesghen Asmerom at Emmett J. Conrad High School in Dallas, Texas. #freedomofspeech #stophate #notohate #stopracism #notoracism #actions #nohate #resign #dontbesilent #neveragain #notoracism🚫 #notoracism🙏🏾 #metoo #womanempowerment

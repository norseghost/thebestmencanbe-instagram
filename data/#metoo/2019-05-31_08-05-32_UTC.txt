Good Morning My Fierce Fabulous Family  its fierce female friday here's Today's quote 
Mighty mountains and great rocks have been shaped by flowing of rivers and streams. Although these streams of water may seem unlikely weapons, they still flow right through the hardest of rocks and boulders. The secret is in persistence, they have been on their course for millions of years without being diverted even once. Thus, the message is clear. If we are focused on our pursuits and remain persistent, we can run our way through the thickest of obstacles in the world and move ahead.

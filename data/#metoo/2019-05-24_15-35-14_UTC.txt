My very personal music video about my life, “Mine”, is up on my YouTube channel. This is the second to last song on Eat The Evidence. Directed brilliantly by the talented @dylanmarsgreenberg, who also made all the projections for my live show. “Mine” is the story about my childhood sexual trauma, my family that gaslit me and made me believe my PTSD was mental illness, locking me in several serious mental institutions through my teenage years, and their damage and toxicity that I emerged from on my own. It is a survival anthem for anyone who has been raped, assaulted, and mentally and physically abused, especially if they were a child at the time and especially if it was from close family members. 
I want this song to make a difference and give solidarity and strength to anyone who ever wanted to scream but couldn’t. I scream for myself, and I scream for you. I love you, I believe you, and I’m here. 🌸
I’m looking to upload clips of it onto IG, and the actual video onto my Facebook, but until I figure it out, please visit my channel, please like my video and subscribe to my channel. I have a LOT of things for you coming up that I want you to see an be a part of with me.💋

Please meet the Izzucculent! She’s a pup of the tiny succulent I sent to my friend @qmh5 when she moved to LA, as a thank you for advising me with compassion and brilliance for *years* on how to handle my #metoo story. Quinn & the USPS got this pup here safely, and I finally got her a permanent pot, where she’ll live next to Izzy’s window seat. My heart is so full of love, and yes, I’m crying. ❤️

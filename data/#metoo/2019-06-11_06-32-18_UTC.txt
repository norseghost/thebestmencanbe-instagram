What a powerful, moving night! @eveensler walked out to a standing ovation, which is a rare occurrence. She spoke clearly, honestly and from the heart about everything â€” her horrific childhood, why she wrote The Apology, the toxicity of the patriarchy and the need for men who have wronged women to publicly apologize in order for our society to move forward. With @idinamenzel.

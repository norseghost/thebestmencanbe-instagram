My books arrived! Ready for my launch on June 8th. ðŸ§¡ðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Itâ€™s a surreal feeling to hold a book you wrote in your hands for the first time and flip through the pages. It was a dream I had since I was a kid, but didnâ€™t know if I could actually do it. My goal was to finish writing a book when I was 30. I did that. Now that Iâ€™m 31 itâ€™s being published. Yay!

Iâ€™m so thankful for all the people who believed in me and encouraged me along the way. It hasnâ€™t been an easy mental battle for me, my emotions have been all over the place. But having good people around me has made a HUGE difference. ðŸ§¡

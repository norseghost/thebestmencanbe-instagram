As the United Nations marks its annual 16-day campaign against gender-based violence and the world continues to be shaken with the #MeToo movement, UNFPA – the UN's sexual and reproductive health agency – is shining the spotlight on the daily sexual harassment of women and girls using public transportation in Sri Lanka. 
Why Sri Lanka? Because according to a study carried out by the UN agency in the country in 2015, nine out of ten women experience sexual harassment while on the move, and only a tiny number feel comfortable even reporting it. 
The UNFPA multimedia project is called “Don’t Look Away,” and was made in partnership with British photo-journalist Eliza Hatch, creator of the Cheer Up Luv initiative, which highlights disturbing encounters endured by women and girls in public spaces, in various parts of the world.

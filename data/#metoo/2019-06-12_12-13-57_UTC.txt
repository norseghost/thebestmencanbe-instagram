Unlike a very journalistic and literal (and unpoetic) work of Andrea Bowers, a Barcelona born Alicia Framis takes a much more poetic take on similar issue of violence against women, activism and different forms of harassment. Her LifeDress,2018 works are actual dresses made from hi-tech airbag fabric from cars. Airbags help to prevent accidents and protect... i am left with a question: who should play a role of airbags in our society to prevent the accidents related to all that scum? #aliciaframis #catalanartist #metoo #theunlimited #artbasel2019

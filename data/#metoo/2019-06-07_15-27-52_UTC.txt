“Do not fall in love with people like me.  I will take you to museums, and parks, and monuments, and kiss you in every beautiful place, so that you can never go back to them without tasting me like blood in your mouth.  I will destroy you in the most beautiful way possible.  And when I leave you will finally understand why storms are named after people.” ~ Unknown. .
 I am still busy working out issues with my next self-portrait project.  The one for the Hasselblad (focusing on formal techniques) is about ready to go.  So to keep in the habit of trying to see beyond the physical flaws, I am continuing my project with the selfies (titled “Not mySelf”). Maybe one day I will be happy with the face staring back at me in them… © Ronni Knepp, 2019

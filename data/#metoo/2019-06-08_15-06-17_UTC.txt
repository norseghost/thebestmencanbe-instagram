Repost @thesavemovement: “Searching for his mother in the scorching heat of 40 degrees in the streets of hyderabad, he can't wear shoes like us, nor ask for water when he's thirsty.

Unable to ask his fellow earthlings to free him from his bondage, he walks around in desperation as we bear witness to his suffering.

We are planning to file a case against the "owner" as it is illegal to trap monkeys in India.

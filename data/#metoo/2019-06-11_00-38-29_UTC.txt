Is there something you need let go of? Someone, or something, you need to forgive? Maybe, just maybe you need to forgive yourself. I do. ðŸ’ž
I need to forgive myself for the 10 lbs I put on, for not seeing things that I should have, for not sticking to my boundaries, for using food for comfort, for not getting the laundry done, for not cooking the way I know how.... you get it. Itâ€™s a laundry list ðŸ‘—ðŸ‘šðŸ‘™ðŸ§¢ðŸ‘–ðŸ§¥ðŸ§£ðŸ§¦ and it can seem overwhelming at times. Forgive yourself, set yourself free, and move forward. 
I know Iâ€™m not alone in this. Youâ€™re probably thinking #metoo. Tell me, what do you need to forgive yourself for?

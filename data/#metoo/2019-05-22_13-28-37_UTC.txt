Our report found 3 in 10 survivors of domestic abuse are repeat victims. We can prevent abusers from hurting new victims by putting them on a register, just like the Sex Offenders Register.⁣

⁣
As the Government scrutinises a bill on domestic violence, we want them to add the Domestic Abusers Register to the bill.⁣

"The university at the centre of an online forum that claims to list the best locations in Melbourne for men to approach female 'targets' has referred the creep-map to the police.

A spokeswoman for the University of Melbourne slammed the post as 'deeply concerning'. 'At The University of Melbourne, we believe that bullying, harassment, sexual assault, sexual harassment and discrimination are never okay,' the spokeswoman said.

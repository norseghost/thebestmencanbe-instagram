Headed to meet with Brett Rogers, candidate for Washington State Attorney General.  This state has failed women with a broken legal system and oppressive, sexist gun control laws for way too long. Time to step forward and help #bethechange so women, especially domestic violence victims will stop being used as political pawns for #guncontrol 
What are you doing to #createchange ? .

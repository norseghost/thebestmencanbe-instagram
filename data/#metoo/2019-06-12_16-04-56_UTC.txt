Fellas, your sons are going to grow up to be like you.  Your daughters are going to grow up to marry men like you.  Is that a good thing?  If it's not, it's time to change your mindset about how you treat women.  I don't know, maybe it's just me.  I hardly hear from other guys on these posts, showing me that many probably don't know any better.  Many have been influenced by their friends, culture, and the bitterness of bad relationships to look at women as objects to played with, used, and thrown away. Therefore, the problem still exists.  Sure, some women don't respect themselves.  But if she doesn't respect herself, she just might learn from you respecting her.  Whether the woman used to be a whore, whether she was married 4 or 5 times, or whether she was a virgin, Jesus always treated women with respect.  Let us follow His lead.  Jesus didn't stone women, therefore you shouldn't stone women by using them for sex, calling them b*tches, or putting your hands on them.  Lift them up, encourage them, lead them & love them.  Little boys won't feel me on this post, but real men will.

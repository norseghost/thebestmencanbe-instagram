Just getting all the seeds started during this rainy day.ðŸ’§ðŸ’§ Rainy day Reflextions:
Ya know, if I've learned anything through out the expirement that is my life, it's that it doesnt matter which direction you're running in, you're still running. 
Rainy days have good lessons to teach. They remind me that even though I love being hands-on and busy in the garden, it's easy for it to become a way for me to escape whats in my head and heart. Being inside with little stimuli, is a bit of a shock after the busy- ness of gardening all day. 
There's such a delicate balance between loving something and using it as an escape. The road of escapism is an impossible one to follow. That thing we call me, I, you, it will hold on and follow you through all your endeavors to escape it. The harder you try the deeper its claws dig in. Its an act of surrender not of force. The rain is a always a good reminder for me to step back and breath.

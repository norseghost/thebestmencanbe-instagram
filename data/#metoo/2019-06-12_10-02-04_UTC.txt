Lately we’ve been puzzling over China’s Tom Hiddleston advert for Centrum vitamins. The British celebrity is featured making breakfast for his partner (who, crucially, we never meet, because she’s behind the camera). Once breakfast is served and he’s reminded her to take her vitamins, he announces he’ll be away for the coming weeks, but will make it up to her as best he can. With that, he leaves.
•
Western marketers have criticised the ad as ‘creepy’ but it’s been a roaring success with the intended Chinese audience. Which cultural differences can be attributed to these polarising reactions?
•
The ad’s hook, in contrast with many Western celebrity endorsements to date, is that Tom Hiddleston reassures on vital Chinese family values, but with a Western twist.
•
He speaks a line of Chinese and clearly assumes the role of family provider and yet he also graciously cooks and cleans - a quality many Chinese associate with the more fluid gender roles and responsibilities in America and Europe.
•
Hiddleston sells an exotic dream. And it’s reinforced by the novelty of a female gaze resting on the male lead throughout the ad: any female can easily slip into his partner’s shoes, captivated by romantic ideals of doting foreign husbandry until the packshot appears.
•
Yet the ad’s international reception suggests Westerners don’t buy into the dream: for them, it’s creepy. Why? Is it all a bit too perfect? Too clichéd?
•
Hiddleston’s character is caring, but it’s on his terms and he’s in control. For the Chinese consumer, it’s the reassurance she needs that he will deliver and not let her down. As many European or American viewers suddenly find themselves the object of Tom Hiddleston’s intense gaze, they recoil because it leaves little room for them to take anything but a passive role.
•
The female behind the camera is not invited to have a purpose, to protest, to participate in conversation. Only once does he give her the spotlight: “you look great”.

dear diary: the #metoo movement is worth about 50 million. pretty affordable get out of jail card for a zionist billionaire if you ask me. him & oprah will be dining upon freshly sauteed circumcised foreskin at satanic rituals again in no time. apparently he hired former mossad agents to dig up dirt & sexual histories of his accusers to intimidate, blackmail & harass them further. kinda reminds me of my situation. (my enemies have a trove of gossipy data & ammo on me... pretty cool people overall) the corruption in the arts is higher than any of this mexican cartel / mafia / gangsterism. that silver rabbit sculpture by jeff koons sold for like $90 million or something a little while back. every major modern gallery i visit around the world always showcases the same exact crew ad infinitum: warhol, kahlo, gaugin, degas, dekooning, duchamp, picasso, caravaggio, klee, monet, whatever, rodin, basquiat, miro, kandinsky, etc. etc. like every gallery from russia to guatemala is grinding the same 30-40 artists, like top 40 music hits; centralized. harvey weinstein probably owns a picasso or two. it's not all bad though. i still believe in hideo kojima. read derrick jensen books for some sense of truth in modernity. that's all the advice i have

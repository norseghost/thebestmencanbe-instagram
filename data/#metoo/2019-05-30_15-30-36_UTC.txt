The real morality of Hollywood.

Hollywood on Twitter: “listen to us, we know best, we are the arbiters of truth and all should bow before our moral code.” Hollywood in reality: “I don’t have time to clean my mess, have some piece of shit who doesn’t make as much as me wash it.” Remember this next Oscars when they give their inspirational speeches on their greatness.

Actor and former Nfl Star Terry Cruz recently came out as an #metoo victim. After finding out about the Harvey Weinstein scandal, he felt the need to share his story. In 2016, Terry and his wife attended a industry event where he was groped by an male executive in front of his wife. The offender had the nerve to “grin like a jerk” because of the couples response to the action he deemed tolerable. Terry immediately wanted to take matters into his own hands but he feared backlash from authorities and society because he’s African-American. It’s highly common for people of color to have a non-trusting relationship with law enforcement and feel like they’re voices won't be heard but instead manipulated into something entirely different. Clearly, Terry experienced a form of internalized racial oppression. Terry sharing his story was the best thing he could do for him and every other survivor out there. If situations like this never get addressed it won't just go away, ignoring the problem makes it worse and reinforces the problem/oppression. So, stand up and say #metoo #metoomovement #terrycruz #internalizedracism #sexualassault #livingwhileblack -Priscilla Escobar

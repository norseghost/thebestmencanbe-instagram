(PART 3: Last One) Survivors: You are all strong. Your healing is your path, and I simply found mine in going as far as I did.  Some may go farther and some will feel best just taking time for themselves.

Friends of survivors: Seek help too and listen.  I wouldn’t be where I am without my tribe, but I know they have questions and stress over my pain as well. It’s ok to be lost, just don’t wade in your confusion. Get help, ask questions, be understanding.

Justice System: Step up. Stop making victims villains.  Don’t call me a slut for being sexually assaulted when I was barely able to ride a bike.  Don’t tell me I am a liar for waiting to come forward.

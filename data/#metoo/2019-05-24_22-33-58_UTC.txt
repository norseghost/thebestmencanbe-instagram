Dear women that have and will share your stories,

I promise to continue to create space for you to share, reveal, and unveil your stories. I will never minimize the pain and trauma that comes with sharing your truth, but my hope is that by committing myself to continue to join your stories together on clotheslines in public installations, that I might create the possibility for you to be able to let your painful story free...to release it and let it breathe...to know that you don’t have to continue to be the “spokes person” for your experience.

I have so much love and respect for you. 
I see you and I believe you.

Love,
The Laundry Lady

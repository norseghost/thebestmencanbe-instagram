This is the largest hotel gym I have ever seen! 2 floors of mostly weight lifting equipment. Oh how I've missed belonging to a gym 😍 .... on the other hand, I DID NOT miss the arrogant male who of course asks every other guy about using equipment if they are even within 10 feet of something to make sure they are done, but then when I'm actively in the middle of a circuit standing in front of the cables that I've already used twice and he just jumps on im without asking to the point where I have to say excuse me several times and tap him on the shoulder and he says "oh, I'm sorry, were you using this?" 😠😠 #rude 
Not all guys are this rude. But I will say they still don't welcome us into the weight room. #screwyoudude #moveover #metoo

That being said. Again, this gym at the @mhmarquiswdc is the MOST incredible hotel gym I've ever used.

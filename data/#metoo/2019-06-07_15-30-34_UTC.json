Last year at this time we were still in the middle of HARD. \nAt that point, still not too many people knew that my husband had spent the past 3 months in rehab. And although he would visit us on the weekends, he still wasn\u2019t living at home. He had just moved into a sober living home, where he\u2019d spend the NEXT 3 months. \nLooking back to that, I wonder how the heck I did it? How was I a single mom of 4 littles for the most part of 6 months, and working a new full time job, with an unemployed husband? How do I still only have fond memories of last summer? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Were we just in SURVIVAL MODE? \nIs that what I\u2019ve done for the most part of the last 10 years of surviving the addiction?\nWow. \nIt\u2019s amazing to me how we are able to overcome challenges and face hard things that would seem impossible. But we do it. I feel like an incredible strength from the other side steps in. And angel friends on this side step in when we need it most.  And suddenly we are able to face a challenge that would have seemed impossible if told we had to endure. \nThere is this powerful source within us that keeps us going. Every day. Pushing through. Even when we don\u2019t know how we are doing it. \nAnd when we are fortunate enough to pull out of it, we look back and see the miracle of what we\u2019ve just gone through. \ud83d\ude4f\nSo for today, I\u2019m taking the time to just sit in that feeling. That last summer (and last 10 YEARS) was HARD as crap. #somuchtherapy\n Feeling grateful for all those who were there for us, weather they knew it or not, and helped us make it through. \nAnd feeling blessed excited for the new ADVENTURES this summer will bring!!!"

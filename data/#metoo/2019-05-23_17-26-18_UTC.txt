Ok I have some *super* exciting news. I’ve been wanting to make an official website for Blessed Be The Brains and after last night’s scare, I made it happen 💁🏻‍♀️. I developed the website with links to our official Instagram, Twitter, shop, AND am hyperlinking images directly to products. It’s honestly SO CUTE and I can’t wait to share! I’ve purchased the domain name and am working on linking that to the site as well. I plan on having the site running by tonight and having the official .com this week! Stay tuned! 🧠✨

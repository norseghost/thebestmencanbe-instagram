This isn’t about lowering your expectations but honing them.🎯 If you set broad goals with vague language – like: “I want to be more successful” - it’s hard to accomplish anything meaningful. 
On the other hand, if you AIM SMALL: “I’m going to make $___  this year” “get ___ new clients” “sell $ ___ product,” then you’re more likely to hit your target. 
It’s not positive thinking – it’s staying focused, setting milestones, and reverse engineering to better help track progress toward hitting your goals. 
A marketing strategy can help you focus on sales, leads, or whatever you need to reach your goals. I love helping companies communicate clearly and create focused strategies, so you can get the most from your marketing.

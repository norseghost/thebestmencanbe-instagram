She is outgoing, pretty, has a sense of humor, and liked by just about everyone. No one can miss her lively personality  wherever she goes. What people always miss is that mark on her arm that she keeps hiding. What people cannot see is what remains when she takes off her smiling mask. No one knows how she is afraid of the dark, cannot sleep at night, has difficulty focusing on her work, always afraid that she is pregnant, and is scared of being around men alone.\n\nWhy? Because our elders/family/culture says that you should keep any business that will create problems to yourself and \u201cget over it, don\u2019t cause more problems, no one needs to know any family business.\u201d You get stuck with thoughts like; \u201cIf I tell someone, they won\u2019t believe me\u201d. \u201cIf I\u2019ll tell someone people will doubt my character\u201d. \u201cI cannot tell someone because it is very shameful\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell someone now, it\u2019s over.\u201d\n.\n.\n.\n.\n Sexual abuse is not over even if the abuse has stopped. Survivors  live the haunting memories or trauma of the abuse for the rest of their lives unless they find the courage to tell their truth and share their story. Survivors  blame themselves, lose their self esteem and confidence, withdraw themselves from people, in short, their lives CAN become A SILENT living hell. It can become exhausting to wear the daily mask before you go out. .\n.\n.\n.\n\nTrauma is not over until it is shared and heard. It is not over till the time it has lost its power on you. It is not over until you begin to do the work to heal.\n\nAnd an untold story never heals. Do not let the abuse define you anymore. Reach out, seek help. SECRETS HOLD SHAME. You are not alone. \nI am a survivor of sexual abuse. My story and experiences have been a gift in disguise for myself and a gift from me to others. \nI am passionate about openly sharing my story and healing journey to empower women and normalize the feelings that come with experiencing trauma. \nI am here to answer any questions you want to know to support your healing journey! \u2665\ufe0f, AM - \ud83d\udc7d\ud83e\udddc\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"

Coercive control is an act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten their victim.
•
It is incredibly common in abusive relationships. One study found that 95 out of 100 survivors reported experiencing coercive control (Women’s Aid).
•
The purpose being to exert POWER over someone through fear, isolation, and reducing their ability to act or think clearly.
•
It is ILLEGAL and can lead to up to 5 years in prison. It became a law in 2015 and is a criminal offence in the UK.
•
Only someone who is PERSONALLY connected to you can commit an offence of coercive control.
•
You don’t have to bring evidence to the police to start a legal case against your abuser. However, it can be very helpful to collect evidence to show a pattern of abuse. Such evidence can include: bank statements showing financial control, texts, emails, messages. SAFETY should be your number one priority; only collect evidence if it is safe to do so.

In what will be the largest tribute to sexual violence survivors in U.S. history, their project, #themonumentquilt will blanket the @nationalmallnps from May 31- June 2. More than 100,000 people are expected to attend. 
Pieced together of more than 3,000 stories woven onto 4’ x4’ quilt squares, the Monument Quilt is a crowd-sourced art project that honors and centers the stories too often left out of public conversations of sexual assault and domestic violence. Every attendee and every person affected by sexual and intimate partner violence will see, hear and feel the messages: You are not alone. We believe you. You did not deserve it.

This is a national story coming at a very important time in our country’s history.

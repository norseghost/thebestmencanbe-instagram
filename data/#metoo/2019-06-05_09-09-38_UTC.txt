“I slept with this student a few years older than me once but decided that although it had been fun I never wanted to do anything else with him. When I’d bump into him at nights out after if I was alone he’d always refuse to leave me until my friends reappeared and then he’d still hang around on the outskirts. Then one night I had an end of season dinner, got pretty drunk and ended up blacking out. My last memory of the night was arriving at the union after the dinner and then I woke up the next morning in his bed with none of my belongings knowing that I had definitely had sex with him again. Not saying I was necessarily raped but it definitely made me think that on previous nights he’d just been hanging around waiting for me to get in a bad enough state where he could easily get me to go home with him again”

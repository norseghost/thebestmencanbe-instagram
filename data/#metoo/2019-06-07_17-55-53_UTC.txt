Lesson ~ perfection is a waste of your precious time

I often catch myself searching for perfection in different aspects of my life, but it’s no surprise that I never find it. Of course, then, when I can’t create perfection to my standards I pick apart everything that I think is wrong with me and wallow in my imperfection. Not cool. But the thing with perfection is it’s never enough. You get one thing “perfect” and you look for the next thing you can perfect and it never ends until it all starts crumbling down. The truth is that you will never be perfect because perfection doesn’t exist. There’s so many better places for your energy to go than trying to perfect yourself. Plus, you’re never going to create the community you want to by being perfect, only by being real will you attract the people worth spending your time with. I challenge you to not spend another second trying to create perfection, and watch how your life changes. I’ll do my best to do the same too!

What helps you let go of perfection in your life? Let’s share and #helpasistaout 😘💃#metoo is the most powerful thing you can say to someone!

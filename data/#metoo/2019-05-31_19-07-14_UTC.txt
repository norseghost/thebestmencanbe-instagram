i was 12ish the first time i was ever sexualized. it is so sad and horrible that so many people (everyone can be objectified and anyone) are sexualized at any ages, especially those who are younger, by strangers. something needs to be done but there is really no way to prosecute and someone who whistles at you and says “nice tits”. i wish it would stop. ~🌷

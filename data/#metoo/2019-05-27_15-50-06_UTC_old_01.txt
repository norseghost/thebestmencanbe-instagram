Meet the model for my next project! Iâ€™m gonna paint hope onto a Breyer model! Iâ€™m not sure any of the models I have fit her breed and personality.

A bit about Hope and I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have PTSD from several traumatic accidents that have occurred in my life. I ride horses to cope with the overwhelming stress my PTSD brings me. I had been out of school for a half year. I was scared to leave my house, I did not want to talk to anyone. Hope has a bad past, itâ€™s relatively unknown, but she was a recreational trail horse. She and I bonded on our first ride. She was so scared of touch, through very gentle and slowed steps I would saddle her and feed her morsels of carrots. That was months ago, today I can groom her with barely any difficulty. She still gives others hell, but she has me. And I have her.

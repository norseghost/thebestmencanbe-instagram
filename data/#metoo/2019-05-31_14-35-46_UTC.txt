I’ll take “Questions you should already know the goddamn answer to” for $400, Alex.

This anonymous submission came with the following context. As always, please take care in reading: 
My boyfriend asked me this question a week after he took my virginity by raping me. At that time I was too confused and scared to admit to myself what had happened so I said ‘no, I don’t think so’, but I knew and he knew the truth. 
Later in our relationship he told me ‘the first time we had sex I didn’t think you were very good at it’.

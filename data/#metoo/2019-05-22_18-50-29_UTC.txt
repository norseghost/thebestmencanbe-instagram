I. Feel. Attacked. -
This is basically what I made this account for lmao, as well as posting feminish stuff and shit ton loads of pro choice posts which are gonna get spammed soon cause even though its not going on in my country, the abortion laws are horrendous. They are sexist and absolutely fucking ridiculous, disgraceful, unfair I lack the vocabulary to describe how bad they are and how strong my feelings are against it.

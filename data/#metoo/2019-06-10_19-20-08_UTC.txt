This month we'll be hosting dinners on the topic of #SelfLove.

We can love our parents, friends, partners, pets - but what does it mean to love ourselves? Many times self-love feels easier said than done.

In these dinners we'll be sharing stories of our self-love journeys thus far. We'll talk about the challenges of loving ourselves fully - especially the parts we don't necessarily like - and also what could be possible for us if we loved ourselves fully.

Come and join us and tag your friends! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

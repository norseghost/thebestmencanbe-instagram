I just watched this film. How can I convince you to watch it? It is crucial, and should be required viewing in schools.

CW: Sexual assault, trauma

Alles Ist Gut is...beautifully, heartbreakingly accurate. It confronts the bullshit binarism we see and hear in discussions about assault every day with nuance, complicated emotions, and the most honest depiction of the private, hidden moments that occur after trauma takes place I have seen lately in a film. Please watch it.

p.s. If you are in any way invested in addressing your own actions, reactions, judgments, and emotional landscapes, go watch it. I love you, be well.

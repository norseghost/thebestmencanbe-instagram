Had the opportunity to see @trevornoah in Hershey, Pa on Saturday night and I canâ€™t even believe how incredible the show was. Sure, he was funny, and I laughed until I cried at his impression of Trump, but I also just straight up cried, too. He talked about men and women living in different worlds, about how men would react if women were in power and tried to control their bodies, about the #metoo movement. To sit next to my husband and watch him get educated and applaud while Trevor was speaking about issues I only just touch on was incredible. We had such a good conversation about privilege, about PERIODS, about the difference between genders and how to communicate more effectively. Just an incredible show. #loudandcleartour #hersheypa #trevornoah #giantcenter

Abused, insecure, rejected. A young man with vision but yet was trapped in chains of BROKENNESS. My life is not easy; and coming to the grips of #Metoo and accepting it as a story of mine has become a great new form of liberation. 
Christ bought me out my chains of BROKENNESS by sacrificing his life for mine. I am not perfect nor have I arrived to the holy grail but sanctification is a process and I am going along with the journey.

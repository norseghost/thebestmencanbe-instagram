Marriage is a beautiful thing.Ones gender ,sexuality, or race should not define love and commitment. Sadly many of us have already heard the news of a tragic law in Kenya. The state does not recognise any relationships between persons of the same sex; same-sex marriage is banned under the Kenyan Constitution. There are no explicit protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Adoption is prohibited to same-sex couples. #loveislove

#MeToo has brought the issue of sexual violence to the forefront of our national dialogue.
.
Originally coined as a phrase to help survivors (especially young women of color), #MeToo has since evolved into a global movement highlighting the pervasiveness of sexual violence and the need for systemic change to address it.
.
Our panel will discuss the origins of the #MeToo movement, current barriers that silence survivors and prevent justice, and how lawyers are combatting sexual assault and harassment in schools, workplaces, and within marginalized communities.

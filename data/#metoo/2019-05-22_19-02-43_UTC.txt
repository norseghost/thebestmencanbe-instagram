To be reminded that our work in Christ is not like the world, what we come up against, how we react, who we are is so different. We may end up in spaces where we are fighting a spiritual battle and we feel alone in the fight, but we are never alone! God places us in the spaces we are meant to be in no matter the amount of time whether it’s a few weeks, or months or years, He has purpose in where you are! Don’t become the world when it becomes hard to fight, become who God designed you to be! Patiently stand firm in the Lord and know He is doing good works in you! I’ve been super stressed and confused about why I am where I am with certain things in my life but reading this verse has allowed me to see the purpose in my story and in the timing of everything! #bethelight #writersofinstagram #metoo #youareenough #bepresent #befree #christianwriter #christian

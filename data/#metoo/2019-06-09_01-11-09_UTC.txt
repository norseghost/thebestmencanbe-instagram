Today was Boston Pride and I loved every minute of being there for the first time as an out member of the LGBTQ+ community!! 🏳️‍🌈💕🗣

I also did my makeup (just eyes and lips) for the second time ever and first time in public and had many interesting experiences with it. But the notable ones are the compliments 💁🏼‍♀️ Fuck the haters 😉

Happy Pride y’all! 💕

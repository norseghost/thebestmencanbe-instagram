Writer and critic Amy Raphael has interviewed some of the world's most iconic musicians, including Courtney Love, Patti Smith, Bj√∂rk, Kurt Cobain and Elton John. 
In 1995 she wrote the critically-acclaimed #NeverMindtheBollocks: Women Rewrite Rock, which included a foreword by Debbie Harry. More than two decades on, the music business has changed, but the way women are regarded has not. In this new book, #ASeatattheTable, Raphael interviews eighteen women who work in the music industry about learning to speak out, #MeToo, social media, queer politics and the subtleness of everyday misogyny.

A Seat at the Table is out this June.

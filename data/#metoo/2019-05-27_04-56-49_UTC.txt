The lawsuit may be closed, but we are still paying the price for our defense attorney. And @fundrazr.me has yet to share our three month long campaign on either Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. Please, the link to our fundraiser is in my bio- if you click on it you can read how and why this whole thing happened. The short story: a man I know had 3 women come forward with varying degrees of sexual misconduct. He denied all allegations and then sued those that stood up for these women (INCLUDING ONE OF THEM) for defamation/libel/slander. We have all been dismissed. This 15 month process was VERY expensive. As a single mom, I'm hoping this fundraiser will recoup some of the money spent as I took out a huge loan that will take a decade to pay back. My partner and I are still standing. Still strong. Still together. And still stand by our original statements.

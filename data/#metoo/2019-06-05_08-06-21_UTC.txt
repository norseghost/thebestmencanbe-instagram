Day 3 of the @women_deliver #WD2019 was fun! I was invited by @one to attend the #Gender7 launch & speak about women’s political participation and its importance in getting Women’s issues to the forefront. Backstage, I had the most unexpected & beautiful conversation w/ mama @angeliquekidjo & Gayle Smith, the CEO of ONE. Angelique Kidjo told me the story of her grandmother’s bravery to change the local policy banning widows from engaging in fabric business in the market; & also the story of her father’s resilience in ensuring all of his children got an education! #ThePowerof a generation! It’s still unbelievable that I would have such deep bond w/ mama & as I was leaving she said, “let me know what I can do to help” after I told her @standtoendrape‘s work on teaching men & boys about consent. I was grateful & humbled. The G7 launch took place & had powerful women represent issues from gender pay, improved farming access for women, HIV services, #MeToo etc. I, as always stood w/ the #MeToo movement! After that session, I met yw/ @niiugre! I admire her work so much & we talked about collaboration etc. I enjoyed it. 💜

Met Aderonke of @bellanaijaonline & it was lovely putting a face to the woman who has been helpful to STER’s work. We attended a session on “Men & Masculinity” organised by @proctergamble. The session encouraged men to have uncomfortable conversations about gender norms. P&G shared how the video “WeSeeEquals” generated so many conversations and even death threats as people weren’t comfortable with how the brand was disrupting patriarchy (funny I must say! That video was everything & I am so grateful for it!💜).

On my way out, mama Angelique Kidjo spotted me & said “omo iya.” I looked back & ran to hug her. Like we only met earlier in the day & she connects w/ me in the most lovely way. She introduced me to people & says they should support my work. I almost cried guys!!!! Like, how can a woman be so kind to me now now! Then I realised, she is one of the ‘godmothers of activism’ that I have been asking if they exist. God bless her for me!

Afterwards, I met up with my Nigerian sisters for @youthhubafrica’s Sandra’s Cross movie screening.

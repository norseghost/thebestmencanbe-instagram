On Tuesday, eight Democratic U.S. senators, including four presidential contenders, called on McDonald’s in a letter to do more to combat workplace harassment because the number of misconduct reports is “unacceptable.” Last month, more than 24 embattled and abused McDonald’s workers filed sexual harassment complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and in court. The allegations include groping, indecent exposure, propositions for sex and lewd comments. The incidents are not isolated – they took place at corporate and franchise stores in 20 cities.

McDonald’s workers, especially women, led strikes in 2018 to protest the lack of protection against sexual harassment all over the U.S.

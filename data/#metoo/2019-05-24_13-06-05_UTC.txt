“In this new life, I am grateful for the journey. As hard as it is, I see that it is a privilege. I don’t think I’ll ever be glad that the abuse happened, but I am able to acknowledge that this journey I’m on has shaped me into one kick-ass, rad, lovable human. And for that, I am grateful.” -Vicki Peterson

“What you can do, or dream you can, begin it,
Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.” (-Goethe) 
I’ve been working so hard on my first public street art! I wanted to re-purpose my art crate that’s been back and forth between California and New York! I envisioned this “Dream Box” to share my voice about authentic empowerment, equality, and environment consciousness. 
I hope that the Greenpoint Open Studios attendees (especially😾 children) this weekend will be inspired, encouraged, and gain a positive experience — when they look at themselves into the mirrors inside the crate. The message alongside the three mirrors (which are Painted with “ME”) asks, “Yo, Mirror Mirror, Who is the Baddest REBEL of them all?” “Retired” materials that I used: Art crate, boots, David Bowie music albums, paintbrushes, jeans, karate uniform, boxing gloves, tree stump, corrugated cardboard, etc. (Thanks to my fellow artist friend @kryart for joining me in the fun of celebrating the essence and completion of my lil’ art project by helping spray the final touches of #MeToo and #GenderEquality colors in and around this piece! :) #Imagine #WhyICreate

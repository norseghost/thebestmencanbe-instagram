How do we educate the community? What can an individual do? Become educated yourself. We publish great content on our blog and have an incredible network of physicians. We also encourage the general public to come into our Surterra Wellness Centers to learn more. We welcome everyone in the family, including pets, and have a team of wellness coordinators onsite that are always ready to help. ðŸ’š @surterrawellness

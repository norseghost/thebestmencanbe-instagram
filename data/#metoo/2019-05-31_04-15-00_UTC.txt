Trying to get back in the groove of things since I havenâ€™t posted in a good minute. I had surgery about 2 weeks ago now so thatâ€™s been a struggle trying to work with that and everyday life but a lot has happened and so I have a lot to rant/talk about. SOOOO for anyone who cares to know or has an interest in what itâ€™s like going through the legal system prosecuting the man who raped me then STAY TUNED FOR A LOT OF MESSY MIXED EMOTIONS leading up to and beyond after when I stand trial in August. Full breakdown in upcoming postsðŸ’•  #metoo #rapesurvivor #ptsd #survivor #dearrapist #findyourself #nomeansno #endvictimblaiming #consent #healing #timesup

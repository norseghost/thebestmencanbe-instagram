                        "text": "I came across this old gem today, which made me flashback to 1997. A time when pageants were a large portion of my social life, my only rebellion was asking my dad to shave underneath my bright highlighted hair (which my momma walked in on and about disowned us both), and goofy moments with my friends were surprisingly captured on literal film that was developed at the local @walmart. Most people had no clue I had been hiding pieces of myself for the majority of my high school years. I was really good at slapping on my red lipstick, hot-rolling my Texas hair and flashing everyone the pageant smile I had mastered since childhood. This photo made me smile. There were moments that I experienced without the thoughts of being sexually assaulted the summer before my freshman year even began, and I can tell you with certainty that this moment was one of them. My friend at the time (you see her hand) had experienced her own levels of heartache as a teenager. Although different from mine, they were still an aching reminder in the majority of her days. We lived a town apart, and typically only saw one another during pageants. But we had grown to trust one another and share our stories while doing makeup, and this silly moment captured was actually a portion of a goofy good luck dance we did before every single pageant we competed in together. We are not in contact anymore other than occasional likes on social media, but looking back, she was my first glimpse of how two women can compete and still support one another. I would never rewind time to being 17 again. I would only tell the blonde version of myself that I was proud of her and that she hadn\u2019t even seen how strong she could be yet. To hold on because life occasionally gets bumpy as hell. And that the only part of it we can control is how we react to it all. How we grow. And damn did that 17 year old continue to grow. #selflove #selfcare #selfacceptance #self #thisisme #metoo #mystory #honesty #pageant #pageantgowns #pageantlife #reddress #blondehair #friendship #experience #lessons #life #1997 #awareness #useyourvoice #proudofmyself #proudofher #onceuponatime #selfreminder #selfacceptance #women #empowerment"

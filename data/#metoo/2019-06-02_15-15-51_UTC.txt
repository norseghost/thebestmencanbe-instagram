We are only able to love and be the person we desire to be based on our level of consciousness at that given moment we are in (i.e. #awareness of what triggers us and what patterns we have been engrained with due to our upbringing, our parents programming they pass onto us and the like of the culture). Looking back at the past when our level of consciousness was lower and beating ourselves up with our current level of consciousness is a recipe for regret and torture.

Perhaps a better way is to simply accept we were not as #conscious AND we needed that specific event in order to raise our level of #consciousness to where we are currently. 
So perhaps an even better thang to do than forgive our self (yes this is important too) is to ALSO thank ourself for creating/allowing the exact lesson we needed to wake up to the next level. 
Just saying...

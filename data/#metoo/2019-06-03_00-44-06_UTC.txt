Markets, Media and F1 Wagyu Beef.

Rivermead Farms is headed back to the Bellingen Farmers and Producers Market this Wednesday 7 June.

It will be the market's second gathering of some of the finest local producers around the region. With stalls from @themandarinbend @mirrabooka_pork @littlestarbeesanctuary and many more.

Last week saw 2BBB FM pop in for a chat.
They have uploaded their podcast to soundcloud - check it out vat https://soundcloud.com/â€¦/bellingen-farmers-producers-market.

This week sees more stall holders, a call out for buskers, touch of television (shh) and of course Rivermead Farms'
F1 Wagyu Beef.

We will be showcasing our beautiful F1 Wagyu Beef, providing taste testing, and talking about our sustainable, waste reduction production and just exactly what's in the box.

We were heartened last week by YOUR stories and inspired by your outlook on how to create beautiful meals with this gorgeous F1 Wagyu Beef. 
We look forward to catching up with you again.

If you have heard about the market, and are considering coming along, make sure you do. 
Pick the kids up from school or send hubby down, so you can enjoy buying your food from locals, made by locals. No more fluorescent lights!

We look forward to seeing you there.

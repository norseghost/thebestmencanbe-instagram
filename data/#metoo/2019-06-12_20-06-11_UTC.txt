Posted @withrepost • @dh_dahitwryter It's #WCW day and this is for all #women. Today I am crushing on us because of ALL THE 💩💩💩 we endure working in #toxic work environments. Whether you work in an #office or are working the sets of #hollywood, we know what it's like to experience UNWANTED SEXUAL ADVANCES. I was a #victim of #sexualassault & #sexualharassment in the #workplace. It has caused a great deal of #pain in my life. I have lost parts of myself sexually and developed aggressive behavior because I am constantly on guard. #Relationships have suffered and sometimes I experience a high level of #anxiety because the slightest thing can #trigger me and remind me of what I experienced. I #encourage you all to #tellyourstory because we have so much in common. We need to ❤ and #support each other more than we compete. We have to come together to protect ourselves from the disrespect and attacks we face everyday. I'm no longer a victim, I'm a #survivor 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾

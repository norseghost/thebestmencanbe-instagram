Super excited when this book arrived today as I've been such a big fan of @amyraphael50 writing ever since I first picked up a well loved copy of her first book: #nevermindthebollocks in a run down charity shop for only Â£1.00. She writes with utter brilliance, interviewing 12 female musicians including #courtneylove #kimgorden and #bjork almost 25 years later, she's done it again in #aseatatthetable still speaking to women in the music industry, this time in relation to speaking out as women, the #metoo movement, social media and sexuality in terms of politics. As ever, #amyraphael includes intimate conversations with artists such as #katetempest #alisonmoyet #natliemerchant I cannot highlight how great this woman is when it comes to interviewing strong women, fearless women who sing and write for a living. I suggest you start reading both books, anything by this woman is a winner. 
Thank you so much @littlebrown @viragopress for my copy. I cannot wait to pick up where I last left, being introduced to new female artists and learning about their craft as well as what it means to be a female musician in our generation, where women are still fighting for #genderequality working in a man's world, only to find, these women have mighty big balls and aren't afraid to show it. #girlpower and #femaleequality is what we strive for and books like these, sure do demonstrate that meaning. #femaleempowerment #rockchickvibes #bookagram #feminism

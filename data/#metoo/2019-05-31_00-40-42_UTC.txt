You never know just WHAT will come of something, if you never take the chance! 
There is no special ingredient, no secret sauce, no magic pill, no perfect circumstance.... If an opportunity arises...
If you have a goal or dream.... The only thing you MUST DO.... is JUST START!  GO AFTER IT! 
And even if it all doesn’t go as planned.... YOU’RE one step closer to who you were made to be... one step closer to where you’re supposed to be.... and one step closer to you’re purpose!

#dance is a form of freedom for South Sudanese women. At the IDPs womenâ€™s centre in #Bentiu, #southsudan, every meeting starts and ends with singing and dancing. You sense that this form of expression is deeply rooted in them. Dance gives them a space where they can find joy, tradition and peace in a country where rape has become a weapon of war and sexual violence is a daily practice. #southsudan #dance #IDPs #civilwar #journalism #photojournalism #humanitarianaid #conflict #GBV #AIDZONE #metoo #YourShotPhotographer

#InspiredbyHer | Olympians #AlysiaMontaño, #AllysonFelix & #KaraGoucher have sparked an important conversation on female athletes and maternity leave protection which has forced Nike to bow to global pressure and waive financial penalties it imposed on athletes who got pregnant.”

@AlysiaMontano who started the movement ran in 2014 while 8 months pregnant, was celebrated as “the pregnant runner." In a video with #NewYorkTimes, she revealed that when she told Nike that she wanted to have a baby, the brand told her it would pause her sponsorship deal and stop paying her. She left Nike to sign with #Asics, who she said also threatened to stop paying her during her recovery after childbirth.

In order to meet the demands of her contract, she detailed how she taped her abs together for races and even shipped breast milk home to the states while competing at the 2017 IAAF World Championships in Beijing.

@Af85 doesn’t want to be punished for becoming a mother either. She tweeted "I’ve always known that expressing myself could hurt my career. I’ve tried not to show emotion, to anticipate what people expect from me and to do it. I don’t like to let people down. But you can’t change anything with silence."

For @KaraGoucher, the most difficult part of hers, wasn’t resuming training just a week after childbirth in 2010, It wasn’t even when her doctor told her she must choose: run 120 miles each week or breast-feed her son. It was when she learned that Nike would stop paying her until she started racing again. But she was already pregnant. So, she scheduled a half-marathon three months after she had her son, Colt.

We hope #Nike does right by Women with deeds and in writing. If we're willing to "Dream Crazier", they're obligated to put their money where their mouth is. No?

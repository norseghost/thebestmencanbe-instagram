Happy International Womenâ€™s Day to all the amazing, beautiful women out there. Us women, almost daily, experience some type of down grade. Whether itâ€™s a boss that treats you poorly over your male co-workers, a stranger thinking its okay to grab your ass, a guy toying with your emotions to get what they want from you, people hollering at you from their car windows, or worse. I was a victim last year of a sexual attack and I can tell you nothing makes you feel more powerless. But I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become and us women need to stop judging each other and stop tearing each other down. We get that enough in this world. We all have similar scars, just different stories and who am I to judge yours? Be who you are without the fear of someone not liking you because at the end of the day you only have yourself and if you donâ€™t like your own company then you have nothing. So, you can find me somewhere between inspiring others, working on myself, dodging negativity, and slaying my goals. Hope I find you there. ðŸŒ» #metoo

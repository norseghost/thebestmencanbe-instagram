Almost been a month since we launched the online Too Much of a Person archive with 100 womxn and non binary people’s stories of how people had tried to squash their power into a box marked “female”. They also talk about what moment they realised that that dismissal was bullsh*t and what their visions for a better world were - all while loving themselves as much as possible. Sound relatable? Check it out. ✨

I also did an interview with my therapist. It was a bit scary and I’m not sure I actually got the words “abusive childhood” in their but hey...all in good time. Because it’s important to tell these stories but it’s also important to respect our own rhythm. 
I’m actually in a cabin by a lake editing a project all about folklore, about inheriting stories from our parents and breaking cycles the magic way ✨

We become the stories we tell. I hope the brave and wise women of the @toomuchofaperson interviews inspire you to keep telling yours 💋🔥 #toomuchofaperson #stories #webecomethestorieswetell #fuckthepatriachy #mybodymychoice #trauma #ptsd #healing #photographer #dianapatientphotography #toomuch #metoo #selfportrait

To tell our story fast and get it over with because we think we should be healed by now! .\n.\nBut moving fast keeps the trauma pattern in place. In order to shift the pattern, we have to do something different. We have to be willing to build our capacity to slow down. To come back into relationship with being and feeling, rather than doing, doing, doing. .\n.\nAs an overachiever with a tendency to take on too much, and who feels like I should always be doing something productive, I deeply relate to this. .\n.\nWhat\u2019s your relationship with slow? .\n.\n\ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\udc9c #reclaimyourvoice"

Last night we came together to unveil the ‘Mother and Child’ sculpture, designed by Rebecca Hawkins. The sculpture will serve as a beacon of hope to all victims of sexual violence around the world. It depicts a mother and child with different roots trapped by a Strangler Fig tree, a plant native to Vietnam.

At the event, we heard from Wayne David MP; the chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Vietnam.

Want to know the number one reason people choose to report – even though they know they will be asked victim-blaming and intimate questions? Even though they know they might not get anything out of taking their case to court? They want to pave the way and make it easier for you to report. Take that in a moment and realize how beautiful that is.  People all over the world are taking this tragic piece of their history and reporting to help other men and women who will come after them. If nothing else, find comfort in those who cared so much about you that it inspired their courage to file a report. Even if no one else believes you, they do.

@easportsfifa you disgust me
My record shows actions and campaigns to encourage Equality
But this female superiority movement is ridiculous and unacceptable
You want Equality, you get Equality in victory and defeat
This hunger to look superior and stronger, is only firing back at you
To show women in the trailer dribbling across men only and not women as well is unacceptable. To connlaistently show women scoring against men is unacceptable.
You want to show women as powerful but failing to our them in strong yet vulnerable situations as tackles and goalkeeping. Positions that require strength
Think before you make such an unapologetic marketing campaign
I am boycotting #FIFA20
Equality not backfiring superiority

I’m proud of every sex worker on this board, but I’m even more proud of every sex worker on the street, in the closet, fighting for custody, struggling to get and education or struggling to live. We love you, we are proud of you, and we are here from you. What was your favorite sex worker moment this year? #IWD #LetUsSurvive #DecrimNow #SexWorkIsWork #Community

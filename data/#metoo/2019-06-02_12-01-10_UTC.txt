‘Mother & Child’, a memorial sculpture in honour of all victims of sexual violence around the world, commissioned by the Justice for Lai Dai Han campaign, is nearing completion and will be unveiled in a couple of weeks.

The sculpture has been designed, created and made by artist @rebeccahawkinssculpture and will be unveiled by Nadia Murad, the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize Winner, at Church House, Westminster, on Tuesday 11th June 2019.

Rebecca Hawkins said: "These women and their children have faced an enormous trial of strength through adversity. They stand up again and again to tell these intimate stories of how their lives were turned upside down, with such courage and dignity."

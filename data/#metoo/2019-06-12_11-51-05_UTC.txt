“To my surprise and from something out of a horror film, the cab driver started to slowly back out of the alley, passenger door still wide open and lights on from where I had escaped. The driver then had the audacity to approach me, and in a raised voice demand that I get back in the vehicle. I backed away and screamed at the top of my lungs that the cops were on their way and there was no way in hell I was getting back in the car (although my phone was dead so I had no idea if that was actually true). It was somewhere during that moment the cops made their heroic arrival and I knew the nightmare was over.” Moral of the story, I learned a few key lessons that day:
1. Do not travel solo late at night. My dad has always stressed nothing and no one good happens after midnight and I’ve found that to be true in this crazy world. 
2. Never take shortcuts to save a few bucks. I have been an advocate for safe traveling hours for women at work and have made it clear to all companies moving forward I will not travel late at night due to safety reasons. Ladies, they must respect that or you MUST go to HR.
3. Always have a charged phone! You must have an outlet to share where you are with someone. I also find turning your location on while traveling is a smart way to stay safe. I also now make the extra effort to stop and charge a dead phone when exiting a flight because it is not worth comprising my safety ever again.
4. Stand up for yourself. If you feel like your driver is not listening to you, get their attention and call out their mistake on your route. If they are not cooperating start strategizing an exit plan immediately. Praying your exit plan is safer than mine, but you never know the scenario you may find yourself in.”

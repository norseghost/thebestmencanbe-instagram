#flashback to the last beach I ran on. Can you guess where this is? ðŸ‘£
Tomorrow I run on another beach...Serbia. It's not a conventional beach because it's part of the Danube river. Us humans and our sun worship means we find beaches even on rivers and lakes ðŸ˜‚ I'm grateful because it makes #footstepstosinspire much easier to plan!

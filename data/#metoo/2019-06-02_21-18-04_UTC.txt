I had a long list of errand ”To Do’s” yesterday after I finished my last coaching client. Then...the torrential rain...the wind...the hail. So I turned on this soulful song by @billyelish and FLOWED! No choreography. No judgment. Just allowing the present moment to guide me. If you listen carefully, you can hear the beautiful melody of the storm in the background. Finding my FLOW through dance is one of my 5 V’s that allowed me to heal and transform from victim to victor. #bevictorious *I do not own the rights to this music. This is for motivational use only.*

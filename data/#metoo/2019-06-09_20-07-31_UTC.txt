I love Holycow so much that I will visit at least once every visit to Jakarta. Naturally, seeing Holysteak; I would want to give it a try. This restaurant was horrible. The tenderloin was anything but tender. It tasted like processed meat and so overcooked it was like eating cardboard. The ribeye was okay, but presentation was awful.  While they do have a larger offering, I'd say it's better to stick with Holycow.

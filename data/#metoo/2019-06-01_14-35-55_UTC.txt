Reposted from @mydefiningmoment -  People think they know you based on where they met you without giving you any credit for where you are today. Those are very dangerous people to keep in your life because they will continue to invalidate you or acknowledge your growth. In order to emotionally protect yourself from harm it will be in your best interest to maintain very limited to no contact with those that continually treat you that way. If they can't meet you where you are today, leave them where you found them.ðŸ’¯ðŸ‘‹ - #regrann

Had a wobble yesterday so shared my Day 3 privately on our Facebook group so here’s Day 4 of the #selfloveweek #selflovechallenge @iammelwells and @theselflovesummit have asked used you #showyourself 
I’ve thought all day what to do and I’ve taken some inspiration from Mel’s email. I’m going to share my biggest dream and aspiration. It’s really personal to me and something that I only realised the importance of over the past few years but if one day I can achieve this then I know none of it would have been for a waste. 
My hope and aim is that one day the law will be changed around how childhood sexual abuse cases are tried and how the victims are looked after before, during and after. 
It’s a huge undertaking and I know it will be a fight but I want to make a difference. 
It’s taken a lot just to write that but today felt right. This is my truth 🙌🏻 #loveyourself #bekind #endsexualviolence #changethelaw #mydreams #bethechange #theywillnotwin #happiness #strength #love #support #youarenotalone #metoo

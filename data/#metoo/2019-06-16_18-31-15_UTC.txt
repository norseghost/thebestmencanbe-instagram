“If you want to heal it, you have to feel it.”
-🌸
Whew. I’ve struggled with this philosophy my entire life. I always dealt with things by NOT feeling—brushing aside, ignoring, excusing, faulting, denying MY own thoughts. I would even brag that I just move forward, I persevere. It was my prized strength. My defense mechanism. In retrospect, I was creating a deep cavern of languished feelings. They very much still existed, and I would one day have to face them. -🌸
Even during my assault, I relied on my ability to disengage from the situation and detach from reality to endure the repeated rape and sodomy from my attacker. Afterwards, I focused on the trial. I took a medical leave from school and was unemployed. My focus was attending every court proceeding and getting justice for myself and his other victims. I didn’t have time for processing my feelings; too much was on the line. -🌸
Almost twelve years later, I am feeling the effects of those languished emotions (before and after the attack). It is what has spurred me to this journey of supporting and empowering other survivors. We are as unique as our stories, but our survival makes us part of this beautiful sisterhood. You don’t have to go through this journey alone, but you do have to go through to find your healing. Be like the lotus! One day at a time, sis. You can do this! 🌸🌺🌸🌺

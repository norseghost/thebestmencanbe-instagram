Whatâ€™s more important to you? Your figure or your mental health? For me it was my figure, and let me tell you Iâ€™ve been unhappy for the longest time. 
Social media is an amazing place to learn new things, meet new people and express the things you love!ðŸ’– but weâ€™re using it for the wrong things now like bullying and stalking, what happened to making the world a better place? A lot of people suffer in silence and I want that to STOP I want people to feel like their problems ARENâ€™T problems just mountains to climb and hurdles to jumpðŸ§¡

Gabriel Taye, a son, a student, a best friend, a nephew, and a story that ended too soon. Gabriel was only 8 years young when he commited suicide by hanging himself with a necktie at home. After 24-minute-long security footage was released showing Gabriel falling unconscious in the entrance of the school’s boys’ restrooms, two days later he would take his own life.  In the footage you can see children walk by the Gabriel and over his legs. Some inspects and poke him for about five minutes until an adult enters the bathroom. At least three adults enter the bathroom. They look at Gabriel, and some kneel down to get closer to him. Eventually, Gabriel stands up and leaves with the adults. The detective working the case stated that he had seen “‘bullying’ and behavior that ‘could even rise to the level of criminal assault’” after watching the footage. In a statement to CNN, Gabriel's mother said, "Gabriel was a shining light to everyone who knew and loved him. We miss him desperately and suffer everyday. His life was not only stolen from him, but from those of us who expected to watch him grow up and enjoy life. If I could, I would give anything to have him back."

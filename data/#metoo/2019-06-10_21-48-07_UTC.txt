Your words are helping someone. You may never know it, but by speaking your truth, you’re making the world a better place.

We just launched our podcast last Tuesday (new episode tomorrow, btw!) and our first guest Amanda spoke with our host @emilobabo for a half an hour about her story and how she’s healed from the abuse. So many of you have reached out to myself or Emily to let us know how impactful Amanda’s story has been for you. Her words have been not only a survival guide but validation that you aren’t alone.

And I know how true this is. Amanda was a light for me when I first left my abusive relationship. She was one of the first people I told and she listened and hugged me and told me everything would be ok. And once I learned her story, I started taking bits and pieces of it in order to make myself stronger. Her story was my survival guide, just like all of the survivor stories on HER’s blog have been used as a survival guide for others.

Your story has power. And if you don’t want to share it, that is ok too. But if you’re even a little bit curious about how you can share, let me know. HER was started so that survivors across the globe could get their voices back.

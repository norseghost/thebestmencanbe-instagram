I use. I use meditation NOT medication. It's as simple as that. Was the journey always that simple - Hell NO!!

My #soberjourney began February 1, 1993. The night before that, I attended a Super Bowl party and couldn't remember how I got home.... and I was the driver. My kids were with their dad every other weekend and I drank a lot when they were gone. That February I made a vow to be sober for my kids, first, then me.  They deserved a #soberparent  Someone who was going to be present for them, someone who was going to make it home to them, unaffected by alcohol and drugs. #alcoholisadrug ------------------------------
It was not always easy - I have a few monsters in my closest. No doubt I've been the monster, too. Thankfully with therapy, AA, Alanon, sober allies, supportive husband and friends, my babies, energy work, Shamanic journeying and MEDITATION I have remained #cleanandsober for 26 years. Ok let me add that I have a very strong will-will that is 100% influenced by meditation. ------------------------------
There are a few people close to me who are struggling with this right now. Maybe a few people close to you, too. Wherever you are on your #pathofsobriety know this:  you are not alone! There are many ways to get there and many who are willing to guide you - me being one of them. (See the above paragraph for "ways to get there") ------------------------------
#taketheleap - show yourself some compassion-find a #soberally and don't stop. I see you.  I love you!

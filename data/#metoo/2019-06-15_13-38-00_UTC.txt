12th of June Switzerland wide women’s strike
-
Thousands of women going to the streets protesting for equality
Some people might think now: Isn’t Switzerland already ranking high in women empowerment?
Well here some facts:
-Women on average earn 17.4% less compared to men; 44% of this salary difference can be traced back to salary discrimination caused by gender
-Women have a higher poverty risk; worldwide single moms make up a great proportion of the population’s poorest regions
-The pink tax: In Switzerland women’s hygiene products are further subject to increased taxes and are taxed as a luxury good whereas flowers for example are taxed as a commodity
-Women are heavily underrepresented in parliament: Only 32% in the National Council (Nationalrat) are women and in the Council of States (Ständerat) its only 15.2%
-Few women are in leading positions
-Patriarchy is still widespread: Only 5% of households are managed by stay at home dad’s
-Domestic Violence: 73% of the victims are women; 2 women per month die as a direct cause of domestic violence
-59% of all women in Switzerland have at least once been sexually assaulted physically

So when people argue that they don’t feel disadvantaged as a woman and that we don’t need a women’s strike setting a sign-You can either call yourself lucky to belong to the very few that not have experienced any discrimination - or maybe you just weren’t aware of it - UNTIL NOW.

Those are just a few facts regarding Switzerland-and yet its very important to mention that we are still part of the lucky ones-That in many countries women don’t even have the right to stand up for their rights and raise their voice...
That’s why it’s so important that we, the priviledged ones do-representing all the voiceless women around the world in the hope that one day we all enjoy the same rights.

And if some people still don’t get it right: No women empowerment, feminism, however you may call it is about gender EQUALITY and is by no means against men

Writing my final project at university was challenging, exciting, scary and motivating all at once. Initially, I wanted to write a dystopian novella, but my personal tutor urged me to write about something I could relate to, something important to me that I wanted to share with the world. I was writing at a time when a lot of things were happening in the entertainment industry. The #metoo and #timesup movement inspired me to write about women and their challenges in society. Sadness, nostalgia, jealousy, anger and lust can manifest in many forms. These emotions were the basis for my collection of short stories, 'Daisy Chain'. I'm so happy that I ditched the dystopian idea and focused on something impactful and important 🌼🌼🌼
It also made me realise how short life is, and ultimately, it gave me the final push I needed to travel halfway across the world ✈️🌏

ðŸŒºBe braveðŸŒºbe kindðŸŒºbe wildðŸŒºbe as beautiful as you are. 
Loving yourself is as deep as it gets.
I myself know the pain of self hate ðŸ˜”(that's another story on why) but i realized nothing about disliking myself was going to help me feel better about myself. I knew i needed to learn ta love myself again. Time & patience, trust & hard work ... ðŸŒ±Practice self love daily & remember how amazingly unique & special you are. 
Blessed be to you all. Shine brightâœ¨

Just a reminder to fit yourself in this week if you haven’t already. Make that hair or nail appointment you’ve been putting off. Do the dang face mask. Read 3 chapters of that new book. Spend some time in the Word. Whatever that “me time” looks like for you, don’t put it off. You owe yourself a breather- take some time for YOU. .

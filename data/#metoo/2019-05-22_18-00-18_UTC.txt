PINK vs BLUE ⠀
⠀
Did you know that people will change how they interact with your baby based on what they're wearing? Girls in pink will be "cute" or "delicate" while boys might be "strong" in blues and green. And research tells us that these changes are not insignificant. So what you do?⠀
⠀
At Bodhi Baby, we think that colors shouldn't be gendered and offer gender-neutral boxes (and never ever pink wash our little girls) letting babies be, well just babies.

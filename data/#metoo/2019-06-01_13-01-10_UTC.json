                        "text": "#FreeSpeech is one of the fundamental principles of a thriving democracy. When petulant politicians, aka Trump, openly defame the press, high-profile figures and other politicians for exercising their #FreedomOfSpeech privilege, there are a multitude of dangerous domestic and international\u00a0ramifications. This has been evidenced over and over again since this vile man took office - for example with the attempted bombing of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and CNN, as well as the more recent and ongoing public death threats of Trump-targets, @ocasio2018 and @ilhanmn.\n.\nAttempts to suppress the press and opposing politicians for their views is neither new, nor an effective long-term governing strategy. It\u2019s been the long-established and flawed practice of parochial and prickly politicians throughout history. Napoleon did it. Hitler did it. Stalin did it. Mussolini did it. All massive narcissistic jerks.\n.\nAsk yourself: what role does the GOP\u2019s vicious political rhetoric have to play in collective acts of barbarity?\n.\n\u201cDeath is the solution to all problems. No man, no problem.\u201d - Joseph Stalin.\n.\n\u201cIt is the press, above all, which wages a positively fanatical and slanderous struggle, tearing down everything which can be regarded as a support of national independence, cultural elevation, and the economic independence of the nation.\u201d - Adolf Hitler.\n.\nYikes. If we\u2019d thrown in some typos, those could literally have been a toilet-trips worth of Trump Tweets!\n.\nRather than paying homage to the warped ideologies of dictators, insisting on their supreme and infinite exactitude, don\u2019t you wish The Republican Party and their repulsive President would take a leaf out of Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson\u2019s, book who eloquently said: \u201cIt is not by the consolidation or concentration of powers, but by their distribution that good government is effected.\u201d\n.\n#fucktrump #beaconsciouscitizen"

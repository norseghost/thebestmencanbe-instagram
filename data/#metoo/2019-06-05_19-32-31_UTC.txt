“I believe there is a revolution happening amongst women today; a revolution in healing.” @resurrektion_of_me my dear... this book is pure brilliance. Indeed a journey through the flames where we emerge a phoenix... rising from the ashes. I am blessed to be part of this revolution. I am grateful that we connected on Instagram. I would love to explore how to support your journey.  While our experiences are different... the journeys of our souls are similar... which is the hidden gem in being a woman in recovery. We look for the similarities.. not the differences. 
If you are a woman in recovery, if you are a woman who experienced trauma and defeat- if you are a woman who still struggles, who is clawing their way out of a seemingly bottomless pit of despair... you need to read this book. Actually, if you are a woman... you need to read this book. Join the revolution.. let your voices be heard and let your stories manifest into a means to pull our fellow sisters out of the  pit. Together we are a force.. together we will change the world. Your journey begins with one step forward... consider this your invitation... #recovery #addictionrecovery #sober #soberaf #soberlife #soberwomen #soberwoman #traumarecovery #feministmovement #feminist #metoo #savage #staystrong #revolution #warrior #warriorwomen

With Monday right around the corner I saw this today and though this was some great motivation for the week ahead!

Many people will say things like “I can’t afford to go to the gym/eat healthy/invest in education/etc” 
BUT yet still have money to eat out/buy alcohol/Skip the Dishes, etc. 🤔

Or they say “I’m so busy I have no time” but have time for social media/Netflix marathons, etc. 🧐

It’s not always about what you can/can’t afford. Sometimes it’s about your priorities. 
Think about where you want to be. Then REALLY assess where you’re spending your time, energy, resources and money. It is quite possible that some of those could be rearranged to get you to where you want to go!

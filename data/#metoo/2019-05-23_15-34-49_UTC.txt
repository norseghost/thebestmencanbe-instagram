Be careful kissing a date in NC. Even a kiss can be considered consent for sex, and once that ‘consent’ is given, you don’t have any right to revoke it. There’s no legal option for stopping what can then become a sexual assault. Did you know that NC is one of TEN states in which it’s perfectly legal to have non consensual sex with an incapacitated person if they were already drunk, or, high? So, it’s entirely possible to roofie someone, rape them, and get away with both crimes. Our Through The Rain collection supports rainn.org, the nation’s largest anti- sexual violence org. Wear one for yourself or in honor of another survivor ☔️ #rainn #sexualassault #helpingothers #charity #northcarolina #metoo #senatorjeffjackson #mariahcarey #throughtherain

Indian Country Today spent the past nine months investigating sexual harassment issues in Indian Country. In the process of reporting, we learned about the lack of accountability, and procedures for reporting harassment in tribal, nonprofit and federal government agencies. We also found high rates of unreported incidents, negative consequences for victims and a culture of protecting perpetrators. #metoo

Chicago was amazing ðŸ˜­ I recently attended the American Medical Association conference as my school's delegate. This was my very first parli pro (with all the ayyeees and naaays), which felt like a game of mental gymnastics that required stamina just to keep up.

We debated, exhausted, and voted through controversial health policies: housing crisis, gun violence, abortion, opioids, immigration, borders, #metoo... topics that I think about often (especially at 3AM, clearly I am fun) but never knew what to do about. I was absolutely floored by how intelligent, passionate, and eloquent the other delegates were. They taught me so much in such a short amount of time. It was overwhelmingly challenging, which meant it was very exciting. We even met the @u.s.surgeongeneral

I like to think we live this life to make a better one. Although the medical student section is well-known for providing the most idealistic ideas, I'm grateful to be in this mindset for now. We get to have the audacity to question everything without the burden of reality (yet).

Anyhow, that's it. Going to inhale boba now, since I didn't have any for 4 days... _

Last week in therapy I had a lightbulb moment and suddenly so much made sense to me and I started connecting dots.
.
I'm still connecting these dots but nevertheless it was a huge moment for me. When I have these moments my life changes because I see what I have done, what I am doing, and what I need to do.
.
The journaling I've been doing  has been tremendously helpful. It is also amazing how fast God sends you tests to see if you've learned anything ðŸ˜‚.
.
So many think of therapy as a hoax and a waste of money. It's not if you are willing to do the hard work on yourself. A therapist doesn't "fix" you, they are simply there to help guide you. You have to be willing to dig deep into pain and be willing to be honest with yourself.
.
It took me awhile till I found a therapist I actually connected with. How long? About 13 years.
.
Never be ashamed for reaching out for help for your mental health. .

Super Happy! Great news today! A ruling was put in place that the trauma I experienced happened! So thankful for the board!

This is a huge blessing! They viewed all the papers/evidence in regards to my case. They received the whole picture! Not just bits and pieces. 
It may not be justice but it is an acknowledgment that what I went through DID happen! 
I am no longer a victim! I am a survivor moving on with life. The trauma will always be apart of me but I can choose to use it for good! 
Finally finding peace on this journey! 
I would make every step I made all over again! Although I have permanent damage as a result of the trauma I can still move on and live my best life! 
I will not at this point go into further detail in regards to this matter. But all I can say for now is that there is freedom and that it is worth fighting for! ❤️ #freedom #livinglife #life #lifejourney #greatnews #free #peace #journey #bestlife #nomore #metoo

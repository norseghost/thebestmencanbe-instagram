Darker picture for a darker kind of story *trigger warning* #metoo

I will try to keep this story as PG as possible. This past Monday, I ran into my attacker again. By attacker, I think you might know what I mean. I wasn’t alone though. My boyfriend was with me and he actually personally KNEW the guy, enough to shake his hand and ask how he was doing. During introductions I almost passed out and my heart was beating a million miles an hour. When Jozef introduced me, I said ‘hi —-‘ (omitting the name for legal purposes because I did not press charges after it happened due to the amount of guilt and being ashamed it happened to me). As soon as we went our separate ways I let my boyfriend know how I knew him. First thing he said was ‘I didn’t even know something like that happened to you.’ It’s not exactly something you bring up in conversation. It’s definitely not something you brag about. So obviously, I had a difficult time telling him, or anyone really, about what happened. Instead of getting to enjoy the monthly comedy show that my boyfriend and I religiously attend, it was ruined and we had to leave because my attacker literally came and sat in close proximity to us, which made me very uncomfortable.  Long story short, I’m still not brave. I’m still not strong. I’m still hurt and scared. Yet, it still happened. I survived & have someone who supports me like no other. These pictures were taken in the bar next door after the incident. These pictures are to prove life still goes on. Did Jozef and I still enjoy that night? Absolutely. Was it hard and did it pop into my brain a lot throughout the night? Absolutely.  Just because someone doesn’t post about it on social media, advocate for it heavily or talk about it, doesn’t mean it didn’t happen to her. It happens to 1 out of 3 women in the US. Check in on your girlfriends. Never leave them alone in bars and don’t let them go on bumble dates with guys that lie and say they’re from a completely different country, when they’re actually from the city you’re in and sexual assaults her. Girls, watch out for creeps and google THE FUCK out of guys before you meet them. Love you all so much xoxo

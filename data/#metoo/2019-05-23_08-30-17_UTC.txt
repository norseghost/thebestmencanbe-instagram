America Ferrera a Hispanic actress, activist and producer shared her #MeToo story in October 2017 after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke out. She shared her story about how she was sexually assaulted when she was only 9 years old by a grown man. She mentions that as a 9 year old she felt ashamed, guilty and responsible for the actions of the man therefore she never told anyone. Even after the occurrence she had to see this man on a daily basis, he would smile and wave at her everyday knowing that she would never tell anyone what had happened to her. #oppressed Now as an adult and with the #MeToo movement Ferrera has told her story and has encouraged women to speak up so that the next generations of women do not have to be silenced and to bring change into our society. #MeToo #strongwomen #speakup #bringingchange #intersectionality -Najeli Cervantes

I was kinda in my feelings about this but there is so much of world 🌎 to see 🧐I refuse to let this hinder me from what I decided to do a few months ago. Get back to traveling weather it was with a group or just me. The confidence to do things alone for me it’s peaceful. I enjoy spending time with HIM and me because the moments you can hear your own thoughts of positive, productive & peace when it was about 10 years ago I couldn’t comprehend who I was or what I wanted. But the moment in time when I gained the power of the pain and peace to be #unapologeticallyme #coach #metoo #victim2warriornode #gracefullybroken

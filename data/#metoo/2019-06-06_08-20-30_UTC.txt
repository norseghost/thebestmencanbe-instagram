For all those who are struggling with a mental illness and those who are supporting loved ones who have a mental illness...
✨ THERE IS A HOPE ✨
I know that it can be frustrating and exhausting sometimes (a lot of times actually) but you are not alone I am with you ✨ I am going through this as well ✨ and I know
✨ YOU CAN DO IT ✨
Sending endless gratitude and love to my boyfriend, who supports me all the time, thank you @expansions_760

#MEntalHealthMattersTOO ♥️💭 Today marks 10 years since I’ve graduated from high school. 
Within those 10 years I’ve...
Graduated from college. 
Started my Career. 
Had weight loss surgery. 
Battled with depression, anxiety, contemplated suicide, and had a nervous breakdown.

Past •18 year old Keke , look how far you’ve come girl! You blossomed in ways you never imagined. Look what happens when you’re loved and nurtured. 
Present •28 year old Keke, 🗣“Don’t stop! Get it! Get!” Live life with many experiences as possible, and eliminate many excuses as possible. Accomplish it all! 
Future •38 year old Keke, 🗣”Okay, BET!!!” You think you’ve done it all, just watch! 
Cheers to the next 10!!! ♥️

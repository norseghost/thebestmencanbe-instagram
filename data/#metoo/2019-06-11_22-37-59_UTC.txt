Today, on the one year anniversary of Jeff Sessions’ decision to block asylum for survivors of gender-based violence, immigrant survivors claimed space in front of the SF US Court of Appeals. They spoke out for the right to freedom & safety, and for the need for us all to keep up the fight. #ImmigrantSurvivorsToo #ImmigrantWomenToo #metoo

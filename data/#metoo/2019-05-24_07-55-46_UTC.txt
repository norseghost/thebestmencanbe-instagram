BRETT EASTON ELLIS​ “I just worry sometimes that the best intentions can get weaponised and you get a lot of people who are thrown under the truck who I don’t know if they really deserve to be there. 
I am haunted by the way the indie musician #RyanAdams was portrayed in a New York Times piece that put him under the #MeToo banner because he liked to flirt with girls and promise them record contracts or they could play on his records if they flirted with him. 
His wife ​Mandy Moore​ complained that, ‘Ryan was so controlling that I couldn’t make a record for six years.’ That was kind of about it.” AMAZING!

This is courage....this is #metoo , this is standing in front of a room of people, adults and young people alike who have maligned you for standing up for someone, because you believe, because you know.  This is ‚ù§, this is ugly crying while singing but it doesn't matter, because you have something to say.  Thank you @ladygaga , for this song....in 2019 we would hope for more, but.....in 2019 it is still a pipe dream to be believed.  #tilithappenstoyouladygaga #tilithappenstoyou

“Men are like animals. My husband does not consider me. He has sex with me when he wants to but doesn’t consider the consequences.” ⠀
.
Sylvia* lives in Papua New Guinea and has a two-year-old daughter. She didn’t tell her husband she was coming to the MS outreach clinic. She received a contraception injection which will prevent pregnancy for 3 months. ⠀ ⠀
Her husband refuses to use a condom. “Men don’t like to wear condoms. I told him to go to the clinic to get tested but he won’t.” ⠀
.
"One child is enough. I can’t take care of any more. My husband can do what he likes to me but I’m not having another child.” ⠀ ⠀
Sylvia heard about the Marie Stopes outreach program from women in her village. “We can’t read or write - we don’t know anything [about family planning] so it’s very helpful to us. I didn’t know anything about spacing children before.” ⠀ ⠀
After 3 months, Sylvia says she will make her way back to the hospital to get another injection. “I have to - I can’t have any more children.” ⠀

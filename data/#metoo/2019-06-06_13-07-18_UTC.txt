Anxiety is a funny thing. You feel it in the body even though it's coming from your brain. .

It's a racing feeling. Overwhelm. Drowning. Running. Fleeing. Escape.  It can happen at any time. No rhyme or reason. .

Most times, we don't even know why its happening right now. But it's undeniable... it makes your stomach flip like you're going down the big hill of a rollercoaster, except you're just laying in bed or sitting at your desk. You might wake up with it for no reason. It might hit you at some point in the day, again, without really knowing why.
.
It is a mental health thing, you know. .
And thinking about it doesn't help. .

But ... breathing deeply and trying to focus on ONE THOUGHT can take your mind off of it and, in fact, release a calming natural hormone called DHEA. DHEA is the opposite of cortisol--your stress hormone.
.
But more than not, just reminding yourself that 'this too will pass, all is well, you're okay, I'm okay, it's okay,' can slow the racing down.
.
.
If you struggle with anxiety, just know you're not alone. Mine is 90% better than it used to be... but sometimes out of nowhere, BOOM.... it can come back. For a short visit.
.
Thank God, I've learned to not panic when it arrives. Instead, I know it's there to remind me that I'm human, I've got too much on my plate, I need some self-care, and to put everything into perspective: I'm blessed. I'm safe. I'm strong. I'm Woman!

I SHOT YOU DOWN BANG BANG! (detail from my digital collage "The Rage", 2011). As a survivor of many different versions of abuse, I carry a lot of repressed anger inside. But the best way to "kill" an old abuser is to rise above all the shit and just carry on being yourself,  with all the weaknesses and strength,  with all the wisdom and knowledge you've learned from the experience and then - time to let go and move on. BANG BANG, YOU DON'T AFFECT ME ANYMORE  BANG BANG! ðŸ’¥ðŸ’™ðŸ’šðŸ’¥

#InspiredbyHer | Sometimes let your work speak for you, other times, amplify the voice of your work! So inspired by this Queen @data_oh who was commissioned by the @google doodle team amongst 24 other female artists to create a doodle in honor of and in celebration of #superfalcons who are representing #Nigeria at the #fifawomensworldcup ‚öΩÔ∏è!

#DataOruwari @data_oh who started her career as a lawyer is a self-taught Visual Artist/ Creative Professional born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria. Though she holds no formal Art training, her interest in Art comes from her father who was an artist himself.

Data‚Äôs style is heavily influenced by the monochrome and intricate style of traditional Tattoo art. She tells stories void of words or color, where the subject is transformed from something familiar to something peculiar. Her favorite subject of choice is ‚Äúthe Spirit‚Äù of the African Woman who she believes has been forgotten in modern times.

She has showcased her work at various art fairs and exhibitions including White Cloud Gallery in Washington, DC; ‚ÄôPanorama‚Äô contemporary art fair in Lagos and Window Studio Community Art Center in Brooklyn, New York.

Congratulations to #Her!üíñ

Metropolitan Ministries is a local organization that offers short and long term housing for women in crisis or fleeing from a Domestic Violence situation. Often these women are leaving with nothing but the clothes on their backs.  I want to give these women a little piece of confidence...a little something to lift their spirits when things may not seem so bright. I know for me, a pretty lipstick instantly changes my mood....and it even did during my OWN time of crisis. 
I am matching donations 100% and all proceeds from this link will be donated to Metropolitan Ministries to help support their Residential programs. Link is in my bio <3
Thank you for your generosity

‘Linguivore Species’. On violence against women, two photo-text books & collective healing. Our most political essay so far is live on @foto_museum website. Comparing Stéphanie Oursler’s ‘Un album di violenza’ (1976) with Jamie Oliveira’s ‘(more) than dust’ (2016), it took a lot of time to compose as it was quite painful and liberating at the same time. The research started with the article on Italian Feminist Photobooks of the 1970s commissioned by Photoworks back in 2015, then I expanded it for the Parisian conference "Le Photo-Text Engagé" last June and the symposium on "Photography and Gender Dynamics post #metoo" at The Photographers’ Gallery helped reflect on further issues. Fotomuseum Winterthur’s amazing team asked to rework it one more time for their Situations cluster on Photo-Text-Data. It’s long but written with love and sweat and we hope you enjoy it, if and when you have a moment. Thank you @nadinewietlisbach @foto_museum Doris Gassert & Marco De Mutiis!

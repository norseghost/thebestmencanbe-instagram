i was taken advantage of by a black cab driver on my 19th birthday. 
i ended up legless at 12am after a hard pres session and was thrown in the back of a random taxi with a broken dress, cuts and bruises and a more than drunk brain. 
the taxi driver stopped at the wrong address and began filming me as i stumbled out of the taxi breaking my dress again and hurting myself even more. i couldn’t stand up. i couldn’t cover myself up. i couldn’t even figure out the right way back to my house. i just sat there letting him film me. 
until one of my neighbours ran outside after recognising me. yelling at this 40+ year old man to put his phone away and leave. she had to half drag and half carry me to my front door. 
seeing me like that made my mum think the worst and checked to see if i’d been assaulted, luckily i hadn’t. 
i felt sick waking up the next day. dirty and embarrassed and disgusted with myself. how could i put myself in that position why would i go out in something so easily breakable and revealing? why did i get so drunk? i kept having panic attack after panic attack thinking about the what ifs. 
what if the drivers done this before? 
what if he’s done worse before? 
what if my neighbour hadn’t of rescued me? 
i had to up my anti anxieties, i’ve refused to take a taxi alone at night, i’ve been through the story over and over again listening to everyone’s comforting words and i still feel completely shitty about everything. 
my mum says it’s not my fault but i can’t help but feel embarrassed and dirty every time i talk or even think about it. and the fact that this is considered a lucky escape and most girls will end up beaten and raped and murdered makes me sick. 
there isn’t a single girl out there without a similar story #metoo
(that’s still a thing right???)

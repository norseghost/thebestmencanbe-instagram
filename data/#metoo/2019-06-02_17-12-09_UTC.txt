Less of a school related post, more of a personal one. I feel the message is important regardless of the platform. 
This is the first time I’ve sat down and done yoga since my assault. As always, I believe the best way to combat stigma and bring awareness is through open dialogue and discussion. I have felt a myriad of emotions since my assault, but have mostly felt I was losing myself in the process. I spent all day asleep in bed yesterday. This morning I woke up and realized today was the day I get back to myself. I find myself again. I don’t let anyone stop me from doing what I love to do. Not surprisingly, my equanimity was off and my hips are tight as ever. I have lost balance and have been holding stress. This is in no way a perfect practice aesthetically but it was perfect for me and what I needed. Im a survivor, I am strong, and I needed some self-care. 
To anyone out there, teacher or not, take time for yourself. Recognize when you need to take care of yourself. You can not give endlessly to your students and not give back to yourself. My students are my entire world, and sometimes recognizing it’s okay to be there for yourself too is just as important. #sasurvivor #assault #strongaf #metoo #teach #teaching #teacher #middleschool #teacher2teacher #teachergram #teachersofinsta #teachertalk #dene #teacherslife #teacherblogger #bachelorsofed #education #highschool #highschoolteacher  #highschooldays #highschooler  #highschoolife #highschoolrules #northerncanada #nwt #firstnation #canada #northwestterritories #tlicho #dogrib

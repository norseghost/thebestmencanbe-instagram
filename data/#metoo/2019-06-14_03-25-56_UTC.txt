Together we have donated hundreds and hundreds of dollars to the @aclu_nationwide because of this shirt. 50% of all proceeds goes to the ACLU to keep abortions safe and legal. I know the abortion bans aren’t the number one news story right now but it’s still a major threat. Don’t get complacent. We have to keep fighting together. #shopfiercely

I'm going to be honest with my own mental health...
.
.
I have struggled with my own mental health for years now. Not knowing what it was, how to handle it or how to ask for help. .
.
This past month I have piled up my work load, then the universe added a pile of stressors. .
.
My personal nutrition has gone down the drain. I'm back and forth on wanting to eat and when I do I eat nothing good for me. .
.
.
Yesterday I woke up and could hardly get out of bed. I was completely disassociated from myself. Which means It feels like I'm floating outside of my body looking in at my life. It was almost like everything was in fast forward and my body was physically in slow motion. .
.
I cried so much. I felt numb. My chest hurt. It was hard to breathe. .
.
I haven't felt this was in a long long long time. .
.
It was scary. I knew I needed help. I knew what was happening. .
.
I went directly to my therapist and called my psychiatrist, whos secretary unfortunately told me no way to get in and told me to go to the ER. .
.
I was scared I didn't want to go there. But I did ... They put me in an empty room. With a bed with restraints. Talk about sending me more into a panic attack. .
.
Fortunately, I wasn't there long before my psychiatrist called me and told me to leave the hospital and go to his office. .
.
I went straight there. There was an adjustment of my meditation. I then went directly to a friend's house. Where I slowly came out of my disassociated state. .
.
What's the purpose of me telling you this? .
.
1. It's ok to ask for help. I went to everyone I could for my help. .
.
2. Self care is so important. I am no different than anyone else. We all need to ensure we are taking time for ourselves. .
.
Please ask for help if you need it. .

"My case received more attention than I anticipated,” Peña continued, “Not only because we were both immigration organizers in Austin, but because so many women could sadly relate to the experiences I underwent. My win was for the community of women who lent me their strength, resolve, and power to continue this fight. We will not suffer in silence. The time of men running from the accountability of their actions is over.”

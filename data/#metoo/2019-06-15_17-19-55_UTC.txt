Hey Men, this where y'all need to use the #mentoo . It is not okay for you to think it's something you shouldn't feel. Men are humans and humans have emotions. So cry, laugh, empathise and most importantly TALK. And if you don't have a person in your life that would listen, please feel free to dm me. If this post isn't in anyway about you, please know that it could about your friend, bro or father. So keep them in mind and create a space for them and again TALK to them. .

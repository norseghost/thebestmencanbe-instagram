Things that are “provocative” and ripe for parody and spoofing: explorations of gender roles and expression, sexual identities, morality around issues of monogamy and sex positivity, especially with regards to class. Things that are none of the above and never “exuberant”: incest and pedophilia. In 2019 there is no excuse for a progressive theater company not to include a content warning. An allusion in the program after one is already seated is too late. Worst of all, I had convinced my young companion to come out to the theater as a change of pace from the active triggering they had already been experiencing. Do better.

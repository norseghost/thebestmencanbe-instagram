This morning has been filled with deep reflections about what it means to heal.

My painting Midnight No 2. immediately came to mind. I look at this painting and I can remember feeling the numbness that had been in my heart since childhood, ice blue energy that was buried away from view. It was the shame, sadness, fear, and isolation that often accompanies trauma. For much of my life I internalized the confusing things that were happening all around me, I assumed responsibility for them because if they were my fault then perhaps I was the one in control. I felt like I was living my life behind a mask, disconnected, shut down, fearful, and sad.

Then about four years ago everything changed. My heart began to break open. I regained access to suppressed memories. It was the most difficult period of my life but I knew that if I didnâ€™t deal with the things that were coming up that there was no way I was going to survive, let alone find genuine happiness and fulfillment in my life. I began the process of consciously breaking myself open. It was not always a gentle process, it could feel violent and dark at times. Sometimes it felt like I was getting torn open and I was drowning in the pain and fear that was bubbling to the surface. But each time I healed a memory or an emotion and released it I felt lighter, I had concrete proof that there was light and relief at the center of the pain. I kept moving towards it. Through it. I began to gain confidence and pride in watching the unfoldment and release of my emotions, it became a beautiful and sacred process. Now, four years later, I know the extent of my strength and resilience. I know that I can withstand and grow from anything that lies before me because I have consciously expereinced my own darkness, trauma, and pain, and I continue to grow from it every day. I no longer fear it, I dance with it and feel deep gratitude for the gifts that it has given me.

You are stronger than you know. You hold the potential within you to embrace every ounce of goodness and light that this world has to offer, but you must move through your own darkness to fully claim it. This process is different (continued in comments ðŸ’™)

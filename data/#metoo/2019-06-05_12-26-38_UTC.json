                        "text": "How you advertise your services is so important. I read an article today about how to help victims of sexual assault work through their body image issues. The writer was clearly deaf to the REAL voices of #sexualassaultsurvivors and made assumptions about the psychology of women. Plus, it ignored the problems of depression causing women to not feel good enough or that they deserve to exercise. This belief can come from internalized criticism of their body and a despairing belief that no matter what they do they will never be strong or attractive enough, so why bother? For women struggling with financial problems or unemployment or caring for their children, going to the gym feels like a waste of time when they have other demanding needs. But what about the women assaulted by coworkers (and thus quit or were fired) or by someone in control of their money? How are they supposed to pay for your yoga classes? Listen, I\u2019m all about women healing, but you have to meet them at their level. Some women are in emotional hell right now and it will take the smallest steps in the human experience to get them moving. Start there.\nAdvertising #yoga or #dance to victims of assault needs to have different imagery. You can\u2019t stick a skinny model with her leg over her head as the image. Instead, you need to show women who aren\u2019t perfect all together trying, with their fit instructor gently assisting them. THAT\u2019S what makes them say \u201cthat can be me, too.\u201d I want THAT #metoo \nInstructors who promote themselves rather than focus on their clients are not healers. They\u2019re opportunists, and I won\u2019t stand for people trying to make a buck off a niche market that includes women who just want their lives and a sense of safety back. \nI can tell you what your clients want you to say: \u201cI know your weight has fluctuated. I know you\u2019re financially struggling and may feel guilty about coming to this class. I know you don\u2019t feel young and attractive and are working through those years of your life you spent with that abuser. I know you\u2019re hurting, and I want you to know that I\u2019m going to help you. You\u2019re welcome to tell me what you need.\u201d The tears you will bring to eyes will be worth it."

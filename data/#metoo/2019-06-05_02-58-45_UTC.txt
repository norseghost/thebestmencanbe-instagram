Over the weekend, a giant #monumentQuilt blanketed the National Mall in Washington, DC with 3,000 stories from survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence. Thank you to @upsettingrapeculture for convening this important and powerful moment. It’s on us to listen to survivors and hear their stories. #NotAlone

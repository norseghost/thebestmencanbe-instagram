‘The Art of Smiling’ by Patricia Hughes. “This particular poem is a sardonic response to those people who believe that all you have to do with any mental health condition is "to pull yourself together and put a smile on your face". I am a survivor of sexual, emotional and physical abuse.

I have spent long periods of time in psych hospital, sectioned and lost.

It took me a long time to realise that I am not ashamed of my mental health, I won't put a smile on my face because its expected, I will put a smile on my face because it feels right for me.

It is human to feel both positive and negative emotions and it is OK to have scars be they physical or emotional, regardless of other peoples’ expectations.” #survivor #mentalhealth #poetry #mentalhealthawareness

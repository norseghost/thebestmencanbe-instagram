In Egyptian society, women have traditionally kept silent about their periods, viewing them as a private matter. This is changing with the younger generation. Last month, Egypt enabled women to take leave during their time of the month, after several women waged a social media campaign urging places of employment to do so. Female employees at Shark and Shrimp, a digital marketing agency based in Cairo, would not need to provide medical proof of having particularly painful periods (Menstrual leave is recognised in countries such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and Zambia. Some private Indian companies have also launched such policies). However, taboos about a woman’s body manifest themselves in other issues women face in Egypt and the region, especially when it comes to harassment. While some women joined in the global #MeToo campaign, many did not because they feared a backlash in a society where even talking about harassment is a taboo, and blame is often placed on the victims and their way of dressing or behaving. A 2013 UN study found that nearly the entire Egyptian female population had experienced at least one form of harassment. Many girls drop out of school due to fear of harassment. In Cairo, 17% of children drop out before completing basic education and 15% drop out in secondary school. Egyptian parents view marrying off their daughters as a way to protect them from harassment. According to UNICEF, 17% of girls in Egypt are married by the age of 18.

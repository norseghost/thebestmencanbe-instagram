E N E MY
I look at myself and I donâ€™t understand. Yin and Yang. Black and White. Jekyll Hyde. .

Couldnâ€™t find pictures to depict the time. Probably because theyâ€™re all deleted. The only one was this. Which I posted on an old Instagram account February 2017.  But deleted due to threats, fear, and appeasement to he who shall not be named. .

Writing E N E M Y was a time of darkness. But the beginning of seeing the light.  AðŸ’¡. It was the first time internally I realized something wasnâ€™t right.  Being in pain, crying, hating yourself when all you do is wear your heart on a sleeve just to have it laughed at, rejected, criticized, abused than wanted demanded for or else... is a mind fuck. Due to desperation I took the things other people were saying to me and looked in the mirror and acknowledged I wasnâ€™t the enemy. Repeated their voices instead of his. Told and forced myself. With tears. That I wasnâ€™t the enemy. But still remained in denial and staid due to extreme brainwash that I in fact was the enemy. I was the only person who saw Hyde. Everyone loved him. So something had to be wrong with me. Right?  Itâ€™s a song that represents the internal struggle of acknowledging but also still denying.  The positive affirmations I received from loved ones remained voices in my head. But still not strong enough to over power his. Which became my demons.

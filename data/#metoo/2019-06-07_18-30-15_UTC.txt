Words DOES NOT EQUAL communication.

Only 40% at the very most of communication is verbal.

At the very least, 60% of communication is Non-Verbal.

In some situations, non-verbal is 100% (first impressions, sports, flirting, tonsil hokey, dancing on conscious dance floors, etc.) So why do we spend our 12+ years in school only concentrating on the words? 
Especially when you can say anything - but if the energy/body language behind the words don't match - the words mean nothing?

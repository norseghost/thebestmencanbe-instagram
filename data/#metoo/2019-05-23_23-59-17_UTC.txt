tell me in what universe is it okay for these pro life people to do this. if these people are harassing women for having basic constitutional rights, that does NOT make you a “good christian”, it just makes you a piece of shit 🤷🏼‍♀️ you just KNOW if these were muslim people protesting because something was “against their religion” you know eeeeverybody in america would say “they’re pushing their religion on us!!!!! this is not okay!!!” BUT WHAT THESE “GOOD CHRISTIAN” PEOPLE ARE DOING IS NOT OKAY!!!! this makes me so upset. also credit goes to @feminist for this video, sorry their pfp was kinda cut off at the top. -hannah 💛

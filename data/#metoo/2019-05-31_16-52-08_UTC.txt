So William and I have traveled in and outside of the United States, and one of my favorite places to this day is Colorado. It is such a gorgeous place. For those of you lucky enough to live there, I’m jealous. Colorado is my number one state to live in. If you could live anywhere, where would you go? I know I can’t wait to go back to this beautiful place this summer. .

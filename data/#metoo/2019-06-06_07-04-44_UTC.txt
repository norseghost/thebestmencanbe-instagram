Takumi Nemoto, the minister for health and labour in Japan argued it is “necessary and appropriate” after a petition was filed against the practice.

The petition was submitted to the labour ministry on Tuesday, 04.06.19. The campaign was dubbed #KuToo, a play on words from the Japanese word “kutsu”, meaning shoes, and “kutsuu”, meaning “pain”. It is also a reference to the global #MeToo movement against sexual abuse.

The movement was launched by the actor and freelance writer, Yumi Ishikawa and quickly won support from thousands of people online.

The remark came when Takumi Nemoto was asked to comment on a #petition by a group of women who want the government to ban workplaces from requiring female jobseekers and employees to wear high heels.

“It is socially accepted as something that falls within the realm of being occupationally necessary and appropriate,” Nemoto told a legislative committee on Wednesday.
Campaigners say wearing high heels in Japan is near-obligatory when job hunting or working in many #japanese companies.

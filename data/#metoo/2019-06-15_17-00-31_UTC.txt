Last Tuesday, Nadia Murad joined other distinguished Parliamentary guests at Church House for the unveiling of a statue honouring all victims of sexual violence. It was great to hear Nadia speak so passionately about ending sexual violence in conflict. ðŸ—£ "I'm very glad to be here to unveil the sculpture as a recognition to what happened to them many years ago"

The event was a great success; you can watch the full event video on our website - link in our bio!

3,000 individual stories from survivors of sexual violence blanketed the Mall on Friday afternoon as part of the Monument Quilt, an art tribute that will be on display through Sunday. The messages came from women, men and children across the United States and Mexico — stitched in churches and schools and homes. From the air, the 4-by-4-foot panels of quilts formed the words “YOU ARE NOT ALONE” and the gender-neutral translation in Spanish: “NO ESTÁS SOLX.” The Monument Quilt, organized by the Baltimore-based activist collective FORCE: Upsetting Rape Culture (@upsettingrapeculture), is the culmination of five years of gathering survivors’ stories.

“The quilt was always intended to end on the National Mall, to blanket the National Mall and occupy our nation’s capital with survivors’ stories,” said @Hannah Brancato, the co-founder of FORCE. (photo by John McDonnell/The Washington Post; video by @thelilynews)

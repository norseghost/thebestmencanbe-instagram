LET THE PARTY BEGIN (But not Be Gin) | Happily acknowledging that for the first year in a looong time I don’t have to have a inner sigh about most of my cards being booze related (second photo from a previous birthday and demonstrates the general theme) @unexpectedjoyof talked about this in her game changing book #theunexpectedjoyofbeingsober and I had a definite #MeToo moment (no not that type 😂). I’m much preferring cards featuring what an ace and gorgeous friend I am, funny jokes, botanical prints and cute animals 😉 Anyway, it’s my birthday, I’m ten months alcohol free and I can’t think of a better day to be present, focused, conscious 😂 and grateful. Booze Free birthdays? Let’s do this. Thirty eight is going to be a good year 🙌🏻

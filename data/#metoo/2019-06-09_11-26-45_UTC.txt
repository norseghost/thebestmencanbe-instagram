▪️IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK▪️ It's been a rough couple of years with drama all around me. I couldn't do anything or go anywhere without being judged or mentally run down.
It got so bad at the end, that I couldn't even recognize myself.

Lesson learned - don't let people treat you like sh*t, your only responsible for your own happiness.

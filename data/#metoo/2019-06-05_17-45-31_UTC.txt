Replace the word “lie” with whatever you struggle with- anxiety, depression, fear, guilt, shame, and recognize that regardless of how long you’ve dealt with this, the enemy watches your response to his lies and builds upon them.
....
The longer you partner with the lies, the bigger they grow... so he then offers solutions: alcoholism, workaholism, drugs, promiscuity, impulsive buying, unhealthy dietary restrictions, bulimia, anorexia,  and so much more.
....
Before you know it, you’re trapped in self-destructive patterns that feel comfortable but are actually isolating you from the things you were created to need: deep, connected relationships, love, peace, joy, purpose, fulfillment, confidence, and contentment.
....
There’s a way to break this cycle, no matter how many years it’s been spinning, and it’s through TRUTH...
....
Sometimes the truth is uncomfortable, or even hurts... but God invites you into a place of uncomfort to reveal the sins that have stolen the freedom from your life.
....
Our sin starts with a wound- a root, if you will- more times than not, it’s rejection of some sort, betrayal, or trauma. The enemy festers in those wounds, blocking you from being healed by the only one who can: JESUS.
....
He is the ultimate physician, the one who can pull you from the ashes of darkness, and heal the wound that’s been bleeding out on life.
....
Sin separates us from the one who loves us and if you choose, He will reveal what needs to be removed so you can begin walking in freedom with Him. All you have to do is ask... He will tell you what to repent for, and gift you something in return for handing those sins over to Him, at the foot of the cross...
....
This is the way to heal, to mend, and restore. Are you ready?

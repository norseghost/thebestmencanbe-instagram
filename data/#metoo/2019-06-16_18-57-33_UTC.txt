As we countdown to @chatsandcocktails i thought it necessary to share one of the reasons why I'm a sucker for great conversation. Direct Impact. The words of the person in conversation which sinks in better when there's communication on both ends.

This is achieved by two or more humans who open up enough to receive and share as well.

Our Real Talk Sessions are a big part of our #chatsandcocktails mixers and if you've attended any of our mixers, you'd know for a fact that the conversations go beyond you being lectured. We keep it intimate too.

As humans, conversations engage us and sink in more AND your probability of getting "Aha" moments are higher because you listen and are listened to.

Like Pat said in the Video, Women, let's show up for ourselves more and then, we can show up for each other, for real, and in truth. üôèüèΩ

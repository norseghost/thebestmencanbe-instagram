My interview with #eljames author of #fiftyshadesofgrey and now #themister on www.ynet.co.il. We spoke inspirations for new book, how the #metoo movement affected her writing, Brexit, being the erotica queen and whether there’s a future for Christian and Anna (For now she’s stepping away from them and feeling Freed) and how she gives a fuck about the critics (yes, an exact quote). #interview #ynet

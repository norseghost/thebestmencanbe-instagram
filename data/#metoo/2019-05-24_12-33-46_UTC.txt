It takes courage for one to speak up for themselves.  Some might tell you differently and say it isnâ€™t a big deal. That may be true for them, but for someone who has been told to be quiet; that what they have to say is wrong or doesnâ€™t matter; or for the person who works so hard trying to make sure everyone is pleased - it is a big deal.  When we use our voice and speak up for ourselves, we risk ridicule, rejection, and hurt.  We also gain empowerment, being seen, and being heard.  You are courageous - you can do this! ðŸ’œ

As of this Saturday, there will be NO clinics practicing abortions in the state of Missouri because the Health Department is refusing to give Planned Parenthood their license. According to the ACLU, this is the first state without an abortion provider since Roe v. Wade was decided 46 years ago. There are approximately 3,000,000 women in Missouri who will now have to cross state lines for a perfectly legal medical procedure if they choose it or a doctor recommends it. I am heartbroken. Fiercely clothes are more than just clothes, my hope is that when you wear them you will feel empowered. You will feel lifted up knowing other women feel just like you. And you will know that you are NOT alone. 50% of the proceeds from this tee benefit @aclu_nationwide - abortion is still legal in the United States, and the ACLU is fighting to keep it that way (which is why we chose them as the beneficiary of this tee). You can also donate directly to @aclu_nationwide through the link in their bio. | Photo by @webbheather_

This is Tom. He is a Turkey. He has a long beard, colorful feathers, and very large breasts. He would prefer you look at his eyes, though, and not objectify him. Today Tom is confident and brave. He knows nobody is particularly thankful this time of year, and that makes him thankful. He also knows it's breeding season. That also makes him thankful. #Oregon #Oregonfauna #fauna #turkey #wildturkey #spring #nature #thanksgiving #largebreastedmale #metoo #postcoitalstrut #postcoitalmeal #Canon #Rebel

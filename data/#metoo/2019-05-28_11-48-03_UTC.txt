That day is getting closer and closer... I’ve had an amazing long weekend back at home with my family and friends... I’ve had all the food I wanted and more... zero regrets... just happy Zane and great memories.
Now... it’s time to focus and get shit done! Let’s do it @nina_s_ross_ and @bradleyjackson88 ... can’t wait for my new food plan and I’m ready for whatever my best coaches tell me to do! #bringiton #prepmode

After very thoughtful and moving conference on #womenmakeimpact at @festivaldecannes. Ifrah Ahmed from @ifrah.foundation has made me very emotional about her story. I cannot believe that things like that still happen in today’s world 🌎. Everyone shall know it. Thank you @iamkelleykali for bringing me there 🙏 @thewrap #metoo #womeninfilm

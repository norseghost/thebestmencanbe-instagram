'' IF THERE IS A GOD, HE WILL HAVE TO BEG MY FORGIVENESS''
Chapter 5:ANGER
She was enraged!
Anger was freaking at an extreme level, witnessing herself as a roasted warrior in the battle field of her life,
Wrath could be witnessed in her eyes which wasn't lesser than a burning flame;
She was blaming her fate which was like a deep pain in vein;
Her actions of cursing and reacting were too violent which couldn't make a wicked insane to tolerate her!
She was mocking at the society which couldn't save a dignity of women!

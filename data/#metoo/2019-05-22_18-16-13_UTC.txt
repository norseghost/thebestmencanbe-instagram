@stlwomensmarch , @naralprochoicemo , @plannedparenthood  @plannedparenthood_stl_swmo Advocates in Missouri and so many #moleg in support of Survivors, Women and Choice. Thank you for fighting and continuing to fight. We need you so much now more than ever. 
I got a little emotional today but I will fight through that. Thereâ€™s so many little women in rural areas and our immediate communities relying on our voices and fight. 
Thank you everyone for having me.

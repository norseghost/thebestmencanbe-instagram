This is why we are rising. Why we are in the streets. Why we devote our energy and time to this movement. Why we so often cry and scream. This is our future at stake, and we will do everything to protect it. We have done so much already, and we are so proud of all you beautiful rebels. But our futures are still not safe, and until they are we must continue to take action.

🙌👏😎 Alexa, play "Finally" (1991) by @CecePeniston, Miss Black Arizona 1989 👑 and Miss Galaxy 1990 👸. #SwipeLeft👈 #BlackMusicMonth 💃🎵🎶 ______________________________________________
I thought of this classic hit after all the drama during journalist & Miss America 1989 @gretchencarlson's 1.5-year tenure as the Miss America Organization's chairwoman: The virtually all-white board of directors (after 3 black former Miss Americas all left within 3 months of Gretchen's reign #hugeredflag. Other board members later fled. Eleven former Miss Americas (4 BPQs) publicly called for her resignation. Some 22/51 state organizations (the District of Columbia is the 51st one) held a vote of no confidence against her leadership within months of her rule. Multiple states lost their franchises for demanding more transparency (including New Jersey, the home state of MAO's then-key sponsor)...& ~15 more states faced probation. The 2018 queen @realcaramund got bullied & treated like trash. MAO lost key sponsorships as it approaches its 100th anniversary. Gretchen even attempted to take credit for founding the #metoo movement — when a black woman named Tarana Burke (@taranajaneen) founded it in 2006 & she is globally recognized as the founder. Shall I go on?

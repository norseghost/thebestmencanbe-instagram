                        "text": "Have you empowered another woman today? Have you gave them support ? \nOr encouraging words? \nYou can make a difference by just doing or saying a few things! You NEVER know what someone is going through.. Just because you see a smile on their face does not mean they are okay. A Woman can be smiling every time you see them but deep inside their battling Depression and/or anxiety. Encouraging another woman can be such a blessing you never know what life you can change. God sends certain people in your life  and you can be that person today for someone. How hard is it to tell another woman \u201cGood Job\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you\u201d or \u201cLet me help you\u201d ? If you even want to go an extra mile you can even do something for them. Example if they have a business they are trying to grow DONATE to them. Even if they are not asking just \nrandomly send them a dollar or two it may just look to you \u201cWhat can a dollar do?\u201d Well, maybe they just needed one more dollar to get a Tool or something to achieve something with their business that can be successful if they just had one more dollar. By that being said guess what? You may not want the credit but YOU will be the reason they became successful. Trust me that Woman would appreciate you for life. So today I encourage everyone especially us Woman to go out and empower someone! I always go by this saying \u201cDo good for people and God will reward you later on\u201d and I\u2019m not saying you have to do something in order to get something absolutely not but you can do it from your heart. Story: My Great Grandfather owned a Funeral Home in my home country Pakistan he would build coffins for everyone even for the poor.. if they couldn\u2019t afford it, he would give them one for free. By him doing that,his business was such a success until he passed away and that\u2019s what I do with my business \u201ciAngelBabyNails\u201d I always do specials and discounts and my prices are extremely affordable. I hope to continue his legacy.. SO TODAY IF YOU HAVEN\u2019T go out and SUPPORT & ENCOURAGE ANOTHER WOMAN. \nThis is WOMANS EMPOWERMENT \u270a\ud83c\udffd\u2764\ufe0f #iAngelAwareness #STOPSexualHarassment #WomansEmpowerment #WomanRights #METOO #TIMESUP #YouareBelieved #Woman #STRONG #Awareness #BeStrong"

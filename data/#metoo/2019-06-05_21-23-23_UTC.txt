Last night TCG members enjoyed a special evening of the much acclaimed play, “What the Constitution Means to Me”, followed by a talk-back with Director Oliver Butler and actress Thursday Williams. “It is not just the best play to open on Broadway so far this season, but also the most important” raved The New York Times. With a riveting and thoughtful performance, Heidi Schreck delved into the ideas woven into the founding document of our nation. Our members were engaged and moved by her exploration of the miracles and the inequities within the Constitution and how it affects us today.

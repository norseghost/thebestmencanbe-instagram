The REAL Interior ...üí´
‚ú®
‚ú®
‚ÄúMy Dearest African Child,
You are not allowed to give in to being a victim of circumstance. ‚ú®
You are not allowed to hide behind the shadows of those bigger or greater than you. ‚ú®
You are not allowed to give in to weakness. ‚ú®
You are not allowed to rob yourself of beauty, courage and kindness. ‚ú®
You are not allowed to take off your crown, even though it's made of thorns‚Äù...üí´
Poem by Mihle Zitha (cosmofunnel.com)

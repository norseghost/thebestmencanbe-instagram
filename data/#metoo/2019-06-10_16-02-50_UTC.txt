PLEASE READ: my sister kept noticing i was out of breath. i was healthy, active. but still would find myself gasping.
.
turns out, i’d been holding my breath. …an instinctive reaction to pain.
.
see, my heart was so constantly heavy, i couldn’t bear it. even my body was fighting for survival.
.
right on time, my precious friend handed me Indestructible by @allyfallon.
.
a book like this can be read in a day; it’s so cathartic. but i forced myself to slow down, to digest it with intention. to let the words take their time washing over my wounds.
.
when i first read Ally’s challenge to “feel it all the way”, i cringed. was she trying to kill me?? didn’t she know i would drown in that swell??
.
but MERCY.
.
i cried for weeks. even waking up in a fury. my knuckles sore from punching. my throat sore from screaming. my lip bloody from biting. even my dreams were drenched in tears.
.
turns out, when you’ve been holding in grief for 13 years, your body is screaming for release.
.
love, a dying soul is never too weary for rescue.
.
here’s your permission: you don’t have to carry this anymore. let it out. set it free. Love is here to lift your heavy.
.
feel it all the way. out to the very edge of it. until you’ve done near lost your mind. you will cry until there are no more tears. you will scream until there is no more breath.
.
and then? you will breathe  e v e n  s t i l l.
.
my love, you will LIVE. ♥️☀️

My heroes today are @foxyandhenry @amberusc_fighton
& Lindsey W. And of course Shalom and the other Linsdey. 3 lawsuits filed in California against the organization where rampant abuse, neglect, and exploitation stole my childhood, and so many others. I'm so grateful for your courage, bravery, and strength. 
Anaiah, when you said you felt you had to do this for those of us who can't, my tears turned to weeping. Thank you. (FYI - it's because of the statute of limitations and a dead molestor)

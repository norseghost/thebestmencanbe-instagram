You've been patiently waiting for the release of Volume II and I really appreciate it! I'm so excited to share this upcoming volume with you, buuuuuuut you have to wait just a bit longer
.
The release date has been pushed back to August, so it's just a few more weeks. ABC guys what?! We're gonna be going global!! This issue is going to be printed and distributed around the world and I can't contain my excitement
.
I want to thank everyone for the constant support, connections and check-ins! You're inspiring me to keep chugging along. Also, keep your eyes peeled for a new submission form. I'm looking for a fresh group of survivors to be featured in volume III and IIII ‚ù§
.
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to drool over this cover featuring @kendall_hideaway

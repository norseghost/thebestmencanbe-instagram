Jesus on his way to the pride march. Love this depiction of Christ I saw on a friend of mine's wall. 😁 I may not be gay but I do believe that Jesus does not care about sex or sexuality - he cares about people and loving them and accepting them as they are. I do not believe it is sinful to be gay, but I do believe it is sinful to not love someone truly and honestly as Christ would. Happy pride month to all my LGBTQ+ friends, don't let anyone stand in your way of accepting and being who you are. Especially if they use the Bible to tell you, you are sinful! 🏳️‍🌈 #loveislove #pride #gaypride #pridemonth #joiningthestruggle #lovenothate #jesuslovesgaystoo #christian #justlove #bewhoyouare #lgbtq #lesbian #gay #bisexual #trans #queer #godlovesyou #metoo #acceptyourself #livefearlessly

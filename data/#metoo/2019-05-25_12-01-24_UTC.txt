“I’ve been working on the wax for the first Bronze edition of the maquette for the Mother and Child. The first edition has sold and there will be a limited edition of ten. 50% of the profit will go towards supporting the women and children of the Lai Dai Han.” - @rebeccahawkinssculpture 'Mother and Child' is the commemorative artwork for the Lai Dai Han, being created by sculpture artist, Rebecca Hawkins.

Emily Doe, the anonymous woman who was assaulted by Brock Turner and galvanized the nation with her stunning victim impact statement, is writing a memoir, Vogue reports.
•
The memoir will be published by Viking Books and is due to be released in September 2019. In a statement, Viking said that in the memoir, Doe will “reclaim the story of her sexual assault, expose the arduous nature of the legal system, and emerge as a bold, unifying voice.”

In 2015, Turner, a former Stanford University student and star swimmer, was caught assaulting Doe while she was rendered unconscious by intoxication. Controversially, Turner was sentenced to just six months in jail after Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky decided that a “prison sentence would have a severe impact on him.”
•
His father reportedly said that his son was being punished for “20 minutes of action.” Turner ended up serving only three months of his sentence.
•
The case sparked a fury that would be echoed in the #MeToo movement some years later. Doe’s impact statement, which was published by Buzzfeed after the sentencing, described the trauma she had suffered due to the assault and its aftermath. Her words — eloquent, yet raw — quickly went viral. Last year, California residents voted to recall Judge Persky over his handling of the case.
•
“Emily Doe’s experience illuminates a culture built to protect perpetrators and a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable,” Viking editor-in-chief Andrea Schulz said. “The book will introduce readers to the writer whose words have already changed their world and move them with its accounting of her courage and resilience.”

Went to see In The Night Garden Live today. (Yes, this is our lives now). And can now confirm the following... Upsy Daisy and Iggle Piggle are definitely at it. Either that or she has grounds for a #metoo campaign based on his constant efforts to get in her bed when she’s not looking. 
In accordance with E-Coli prevention tactics, Makka Pakka needs to wash that sponge between face cleans.

The Tombliboos’ parents no doubt left them to live inside that tree after the eightieth attempt to get their effing trousers to stay on. 
Those balloons they drink out of is a guise for nitrous oxide. The Pinky Ponk is probably a euphemism for an airborne sex den. 
The Pontipines are a religious cult. Nobody would choose to have 8 offspring, no matter how tiny they are. The Wottingers are an undercover operation living next door ready to bust the whole operation via the motion sensor-fitted chimney pot.

Iggle Piggle is lost at sea, suffering from severe dehydration and hallucinating the entire thing. 
Ada enjoyed it though. #adacaveabbott #itng #nightgardenlive #motherhood

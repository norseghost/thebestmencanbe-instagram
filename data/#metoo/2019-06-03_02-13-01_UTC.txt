I can thou share my story and post/repost all activism that takes place that helps spread the message from the survivors of sexual assault and violence. üíñ
This weekend, the Monument Quilt blanketed the National Mall with 3,000 stories from survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence. Thousands of people attended to bear witness to our stories. Our community joined together in learning, healing, communing, connecting, to end rape culture and white supremacy.
We mourned, we celebrated our resilience, we planted seeds of hope for our future resistance. This weekend, we truly experienced that we are not alone.
The Quilt is still on display today into the afternoon. Join us for the closing ceremony at noon (the time has been changed due to predicted rain). With so much gratitude.

Every adverse childhood experience (trauma) “increases the likelihood of early initiation into illicit drug use by 2- to 4-fold” (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration)

In other words, going through adverse childhood experiences not only ups your chance of abusing drugs, but also of abusing them earlier in life

According to Dr. Sumrok, “I’ve seen about 1,200 patients who are addicted. Of those, more than 1,100 have an ACE score of 3 or more.” There are 10 types of childhood trauma measured in the ACE Study. 5 are personal — physical abuse, verbal abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect. 5 are related to other family members: a parent who’s an alcoholic, a mother who’s a victim of domestic violence, a family member in jail, a family member diagnosed with a mental illness, and the disappearance of a parent through divorce, death or abandonment. Each type of trauma counts as one. So a person who’s been physically abused, with one alcoholic parent, and a mother who was beaten up has an ACE score = 3.

There are more types of trauma such as homelessness, neighborhood violence, bullying, racism, etc. but the 10 were the most commonly cited in a previous study.

Huge thanks to the very awesome @ashleighbwilson for dropping by & signing copies of his new book ON ARTISTS💫. The #MeToo movement is overturning a cliché that has forgiven bad behavior for years: to be creative is to be prone to eccentricity, madness, addiction & excess. No longer can artists be excused from the standards of conduct that apply to us all. But if we denounce the artist, then what becomes of the work that remains? Signed copies now available in store ✌️ @mupublishing #ashleighwilson

Day 3,634 of the 4,000 to Climate Catastrophe. Firstly, witches: yep, we disappeared on FB again. GOOD FUCKING JOB, HATERS. .

But we won’t go away. In fact, as we speak we’ve hit a milestone in our fundraising which will protect MFW from trolls. More on this shortly. And THANK YOU to those who’ve made this possible.

In the meantime - no, we won’t ignore Joe Hildebrand, and “switching him off” won’t work. Why? Because he and his kind are INSIDIOUS. And because we’ll call this fuckshittery out. This is Joe on Studio 10 yesterday, arguing with Phil Cleary:

Joe is fucking shit. He’s just shit. He’s a shit human. ANYONE who puts their hurt #NotAllMenzy feelings ahead of women’s ACTUAL SAFETY is a fuckbucket. Especially when arguing with a man whose own sister was stabbed to death by her partner. He should be fucking ASHAMED. What a cunt. .
.

Here’s the deal. Joe seems adamant he doesn’t have any misogynist men in his life. This is a fucking lie. JUST BECAUSE THEY’RE NOT ARSEHOLES TO YOU DOESN’T MEAN THEY’RE NOT ARSEHOLES, JOE. A third of all women are sexually assaulted during their lives, and more than 90 percent sexually harassed. It’s NOT POSSIBLE Joe doesn’t know a man doing this. .

So, guys*, what’s it to be? Are we agreeing with Joe’s sads, or doing more to combat ALL sexism, because we know it operates on a continuum where some guys just tell woman-hating jokes, while others bash, rape and kill us. Please comment: we need your voices right now. It’s time to put up or shut up.

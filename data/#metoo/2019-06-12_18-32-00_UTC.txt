I adore this line from the movie "Mulan". This is true of people too, those of us who grew up through the muddy depths of adversity are quite amazing humans. We still grow, we still bloom, no matter how hard they have tried to defeat us.

There is a Mexican proverb I love, "They tried to bury us, they didn't know we were seeds." I think one goes back to the other... We are seeds that grew up to be rare and beautiful flowers.

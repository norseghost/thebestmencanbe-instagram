As a narcissistic abuse and sexual assault survivor, reconnecting to myself holistic through divine feminine has worked wonders for me. Part of it is sexual healing, using tantric sex to honour my body and let go of all the body related trauma. PTSD, clinical depression and chronic anxiety gone. I always saw sex as a spiritual union, the only kind of sex I enjoy is one where I'm emotionally connected to my partner with full body autonomy and full consent. A relationship of openness, filled with beautiful vulnerability and fruits of the oneness. 
You can practice this alone or with your partner, the idea is refrain from jumping into physical sex as the objective, focus on intimacy and emotional connection instead.

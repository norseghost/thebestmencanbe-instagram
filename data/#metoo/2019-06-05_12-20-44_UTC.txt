Did you know that in Japan, wearing high heels between 3-5 inches is said to be a basic manner women should observe when looking for jobs? ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
There’s a petition in Japan to end high heel requirement in the workplace for women. It’s not a requirement for every single company in the country, but there are enough companies doing it for this petition to gain traction. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The hashtag is #KuToo (a version of #MeToo + Kutsu (shoes) and Kutsuu (pain) - if you are looking for a good Japanese pun, this could be it).⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Japan ranks 110/149 in the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Gender Gap Index. If you live here, you definitely feel it. If you work here, you might be paid 24.5% less than your male peers. Japan ranks #2 for the largest gender wage gap in the OECD (#1 is South Korea).⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
If you are travelling, there are still tell-tale signs you can’t miss. If you love Japanese culture, think through the details. You might just find some hidden gender inequality being idealised there. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Like most types of discrimination, the roots go way back. And like most types of discrmination, the ones being discriminated against often buy into the narrative and give up their power consciously or unconsciously. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
But once in awhile, someone finds their voice to speak up against inequality. Someone creates a viral hashtag and get people excited to speak up for themselves, to take action, to move forward. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
It’s a shame some people think it’s “good manners” for women to wear high heels, put on makeup, stay obedient. Perhaps we should not only question why wearing heels between 3-5 inches is considered good manners, but also why society wants women with “good manners” in the first place. ⁣⁣⁣

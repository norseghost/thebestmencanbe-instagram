To the Women for the Women! This story brings the stories of the Women who have been sexually assaulted, raped, and abused by disgusting awful people who got away with it because of the situation they were put through. It is our job as filmmakers to find these very sensitive stories and bring them to life and to make the VOICELESS have a VOICE!! I am so honored To have worked on such a production with an amazing team @dannyman29 @tadpoleninja @youssefhannoun @sultan_alsaggaf without you guys this story would have not even made the big screen or touched the hearts of the women in that screening room or being able to see the women that told their story in our documentary smiling from how happy they are that the world gets to hear their stories. That night I saw tons of women cry from how powerful these true horror stories were! It was a once in a lifetime experience. Introducing “Empoderadas” later to be screened in festivals and online.

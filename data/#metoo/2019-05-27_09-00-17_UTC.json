I'm sorry I didn't know\nI was the reason for my owner\nBeing called a slut,\nWhen I was a miniskirt.\nWhy didn't your hands stop then,\nwhen I was a mere eight year old's\n Pretty little frock?\nWas I even then uttering\nThe same damn thing?\nWas I even then\n'Asking for you?' If it was for me,\nWhy didn't you stop \nYour monstrous gaze\nWhen I was a pitch black burkha?\nWhy was I even then not capable enough \nTo protect my owner from you?\n\nAnd I'm sorry my dear owner\nBecause I terribly failed \nIn protecting you.\nI was designated to adore you, to let you bloom,\nI was unaware that it'd be for me\nThat you would be called\nWith words that unplease\nEven my inner soul's unrecognizable rooms.\n\nI'm sorry for being the reason\nYou got cat-called at fifteen.\u201d \u201cI'm sorry for being the reason\nYou were labelled with:\n\u2018Stay away from her. My mom says her dressing isn't that good!' or with \u2018Hey bro, Check her out! Maybe she's a deal with a very low paying amount !\u2019\n\u201cI do not know \nWhen I could\nConvey words and feelings\nI never meant to do.\n\nI'm sorry I overpowered your personality.\nI'm sorry for being your everyday's worst choice\n\nI do not know what crime I did,\nBut yet they label me with random smirks and unpleasing nouns.\n\nPut me behind the bars,\nAnnounce me your convict.\nFor I can no longer\nBare the pain\nOf being called ,\nThe reason why my owner\nWas dragged into death\nJust because\nI sounded like\nI was 'Asking for it.' I just wanted to clarify\nI was never ever asking for you !\u201d\n________________\n#poetry #poetsofinstagram \n#poetrylovers\n#rape #voice\n#metoo #ifclothescouldspeak\n Read my thoughts on @YourQuoteApp \n#yourquote #stories #quoteoftheday #wordporn #quotestagram #wordsofwisdom\n#spillpoetry\n#unerasedpoetry\n#ink"

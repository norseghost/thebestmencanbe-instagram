I’ve never been one to take the easy road.
.
My path has always tended to be one of high risk. It’s become my default setting. Choosing to play the role of Anna was only par for my course. All the signs of risk were there and everything inside of me said OH HELL YES.

#wehaditcoming is not for the faint of heart. Human trafficking and grief are at the core. A serious issue in our society today. This film makes a statement about the social dynamic between men and women. How long will we sit back and take it? What will push us to fight for our respect and equality? Our fearless director @paul_barbeau19 did not hold back. This film is about some women who are ready to fight and they do just that.

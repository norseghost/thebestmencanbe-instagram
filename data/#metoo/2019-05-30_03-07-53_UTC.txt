i’m sorry i haven’t been super active!! i’m not exaggerating when i say i’ve been at the basketball gym from 9-5 coaching kids camps and practicing with my team🤠 anyways, ok not doing to hot right now yikes. i told my coach i might miss the first day of a tournament in spokane and i needed someone to take me from airport to the game and he was like ok?? not my problem, figure it out?? and i mumbled my father lives near spokane sarcastically because i would literally do aNYTHING else other than ride with him, and he heard me and agreed my father should take me. annnddd on top of that he knows i have a ... strained... relationship with sean to say the least. so now i feel like my coach doesn’t even give a shit about me and just wants me to play basketball and doesn’t care about me whatsoever. well, cheers to spiraling again🍻

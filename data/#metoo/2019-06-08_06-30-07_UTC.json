All of this \u2013 the \u201cnot-so-bad\u201d and the \u201chorrifying\u201d are all still sexual violence.\n\nA few weeks ago, news of a man #flashing an unsuspecting woman in Mumbai, India came up.\n\nThe woman had got out of an autorickshaw to withdraw cash from an ATM. Seeing that she was facing some trouble accomplishing the withdrawal, the man had approached her to help. In this brief period, he decided to help himself by touching the woman and exposing himself to her. The latter, shocked as she was, decided to film the encounter and later uploaded it on social media, after reporting the incident to a nearby police vehicle. The man was reported to have been taken into custody. \n#Reactions of women online were effusive, naturally. The upsurge of #shock, #embarrassment, confusion, and fear of being flashed at is difficult to express.\n\n#SexualHarassment #MaleFlasher #Flashing #MeToo"

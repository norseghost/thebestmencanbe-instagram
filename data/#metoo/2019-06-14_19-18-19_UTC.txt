‼️Trigger Warning
This is the video Chicago Police refused to watch when I filed a complaint last summer after a man stalked me, publicly exposed himself, and verbally assaulted me (you can read the full story on @ihollagram, 🔗 in bio). Had they watched the video instead of telling me to get his name if I see him again (yes, an officer really said that to me), maybe it would not have taken THREE WEEKS for them to issue a Community Alert. 
I never shared this with anyone because in watching it back it looked scary to ME. But, y’all need to see this. This is an escalated version of what I deal with nearly every day. I wish I had videos of all the other micro-assaults: the cars slowing down, cars circling the block, the yelling, the leering, the following, all of it.

I’m beyond tired. But, I’m thinking every day of what I can do because this has got to get better for all of us. This is not a normal part of being a woman. This isn’t just mentally unstable men. This isn’t just happening at night. This isn’t just some men being “creepy.” This is assault. It is a crime.

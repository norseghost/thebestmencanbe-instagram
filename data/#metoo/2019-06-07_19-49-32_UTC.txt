Not every day is going to be filled with serenity and joy. There are periods of memories that haunt. Thoughts and feelings that won't leave. Being caught in a storm without an umbrella. It's best to acknowledge these times and begin to look forward. Today is one of these days for me, but tomorrow will be better.

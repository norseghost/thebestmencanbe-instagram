Majority feeling victimized in a world where you are nothing but a title , body , talent , and look. 
From childhood to adult you are looked upon in those same measures. How well you perform . How well you can keep up. How well you are fitting in. 
When you hear others talk about their children the first thing comes out their mouth is where they work , how well they are succeeding, or how they are not suiting up in comparison to others.

Same goes for relationships. The focus is on where they work , how they look, and what they are providing. 
It’s crazy cuz none of those realities involve LOVE. Not even close. 
So no surprise how the world is appearing .

Because what’s continually going around is everyone looking to be given at any cost what they can only give themselves.

Codependency at its highest being taught, experienced, and normalized.

Then someone in the growing crowd succeeds in winning over your heart: they believe in you, they hang on your every word, and they validate you so well that no amount of flaws you have could ever undo their undying support in everything that you are and aspire to be. \nYou never needed anyone to validate you before, but this love turns all fear of self-doubt into security and empowerment: it feels like self-actualization for the first time in your life.\n\nBefore too long, however, you realize this love is based on some \u201cappeal\u201d you can\u2019t seem to keep living up to- because you were in \u201dhigh-demand\u201d at some imaginary marketplace you don\u2019t yet understand. \nYou repeat this pattern a few more times before you uncover the fact that it is a cycle. \nEvery time you find personal freedom, someone swoops in and has to \u201dtake you off the market\u201d. One day when you\u2019ve had enough, you stop buying into being the \u201ccash cow\u201d on the stage before a room full of salesmen, and your sparkly \u201cyouthful\u201d eyes are traded in for more cynical, experienced ones. \nSo now the experience of learning our perfectly human inability to live up to the painfully unrealistic roles projected on us by \u201cmarketplace\u201d standards gets us shoved to the outskirts of the room for the younger, more \u201cimpressionable\u201d models that are \u201cstill on the market\u201d. Because they still have a sparkle of na\u00efvet\u00e9 in their eyes that doesn\u2019t yet realize that what makes them \u201cspecial\u201d and worth listening to will dissipate with wisdom and experience. \nInvalid is the woman who understands the system of this deceptive place and refuses to eagerly offer herself up again and again by pouring hours of her week into looking a certain way so that her words could ever hold any weight.\n\nLISTEN TO US WITH YOUR HANDS OVER YOUR EYES\ud83d\ude48\n\nIM TIRED OF FEELING ALIENATED FROM WOMEN BECAUSE MEN OBJECTIFY ME\ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"

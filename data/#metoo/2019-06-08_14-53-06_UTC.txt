This happened 2 months ago and here are my reflections on the matter, as a #WOMAN of the world - as a sister, daughter, friend and lastly a human that cares about women and their safety, physically and mentally as well. I have always felt the need to do something about violence against us and this situation opened my eyes even more and it gave me one mission: to show and teach as many girls and women as possible all over the world HOW TO DEFEND OURSELVES. Not only physically, but verbally and psychologically. I just cannot stand it anymore... One more case of a woman or a girl that has been abused, raped, hit or disrespected by a man -who felt stronger and more powerful than her. I wish the entire world could see the videos that I will be doing on self defense moves and self confidence, too. Women need to keep stepping up and becoming stronger. We are amazing! I believe in our capabilities of being completely independent and knowing our self worth.

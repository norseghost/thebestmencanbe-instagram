Noone can. Noone will.\n.\nHowever, there are people who can help GUIDE you in the direction of the end result you look to accomplish but this can ONLY happen if you are already moving in that direction. .\nNoone can carry you where you wanna go. Which is why we when people talk about the idea of finding their \"purpose\" it drives me CRAZY.\n.\nYou cant find your purpose until you start walking. When you start walking, you find missions. When you find your mission, you realize a greater sense of purpose in completing the mission. Completion of the mission lends itself to greater results and rewards in life. Finding greater results and rewards in life empowers us with purpose. .\nThe reason we want people to carry us or \"SAVE US\" is because we dont want to walk through any of the stuff that \"life stuff\" and we just want to reach the ultimate ending. It's like we wanna get to \"the end\" without reading the book. .\nHeres your action plan:\n.\nFirst, acknowledge that you must walk through the fire.\n.\nNext you must take one powerful step (a powerful change)\n.\nOnly after you take one powerful step, then you must ask for help and collaboration.\n.\nThen after you seek help...you keep walking and allow the help to \"guide\" not \"carry\"\n.\nThen you confront your demons.\n.\nThen you fall, and rely on the help to add clarity.\n.\nThen you keep walking in pursuit of the completion of your mission.\n.\nThen you complete your mission.\n.\nThen you find your purpose\n.\nIn that order. .\nBut dont look for someone to carry you.\nFirst...\n.\nGet on track with completing your mission.\n."

**Contact your NY reps at the link in bio, or tag a friend who lives in NY in the comments 📝☎️🗽** NEW YORK: Year after year, an outdated NY law keeps countless rape survivors from justice. NY has one of the shortest time limits for reporting 2nd and 3rd degree rape in the nation after North Dakota. 
The #NYSafetyAgenda would strengthen protections for New Yorkers who are sexually harassed at work AND end the state’s outdated time limit on reporting 2nd and 3rd degree rape. Write your NY lawmakers and tell them to pass these critical policies NOW.

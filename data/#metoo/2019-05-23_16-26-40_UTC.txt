It take a village, so be on the lookout! Protecting kids from the trauma of child sex abuse is an initiative we can all participate in.
During the summer months, be particularly intentional about looking out for the kids in your community. Be on the lookout for suspicious behaviors by other adults and report suspicious behavior to law enforcement or security immediately. Sex traffickers use this time of year to approach young people who are left unsupervised. Remember, they simply need access and opportunity! #childsexabuseawareness #stopchildsexabuse #childsexabusesurvivor #parentsofchilldsexabusesurvivor #sexualassault #endchildsexabuse #endrapeculture #childabuse #sextrafficking #atlanta #ATL #Georgia #church #girls #teens #awareness #rapevictim #victim #children #prevention #trafficking  #survivor #tips #blogger #speaker #metoo #advocate #volunteer  #socialmedia

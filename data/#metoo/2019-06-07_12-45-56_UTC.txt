June is PTSD Awareness Month.....Did you know that sexual abuse survivors can show signs of PTSD? Yes, PTSD. Why? Because sexual abuse is extremely traumatic even if the abuse isnâ€™t physically violent. This is why it is imperative that we believe them and support them. Without proper attention and services, they can continue to experience the effects of their trauma. Thank you @savacenterga for all you do to support victims and survivors. #childsexabuseawareness #stopchildsexabuse #childsexabusesurvivor #parentsofchilldsexabusesurvivor #sexualassault #endchildsexabuse #endrapeculture #childabuse #sextrafficking #atlanta #ATL #Georgia #church #girls #teens #awareness #rapevictim #victim #children #prevention #trafficking  #survivor #tips #blogger #speaker #metoo #advocate #volunteer  #socialmedia

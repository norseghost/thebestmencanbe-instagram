I want to talk to you about sexual assault. I wrote Rise Up because I’m done. I’m done letting what I went through rule my life. I’m done attributing my self-worth to what I went through. This starts and ends right here. And I could get into it, tell you all the who and then when and the what happened, but it doesn’t matter because my story is one of thousands, millions of stories, and that’s what matters. This isn’t about ME. This is about US. We are all going through this. All of us. Women, men, black, white, straight, gay, cis, trans, old, young, all of us, we are suffering, we are being sexually assaulted, exploited, harassed, it’s not “ME” it’s “ALL OF US and #METOO .” Remember that. Remember that we stand together, not just those of us that have been assaulted, but everyone that sees the pain, and it isn’t us against the world, it’s us against the few. Us against some. I’m telling you to #standup , #speakyourtruth , #endthestigma and #bethechange , because this, the suffering, the doubt, the shame, this ends here. I love you all, I see you, and I stand with you. I thank you for standing with me too. #RiseUp . Hit the link in my bio to check out the song and the #storyhive music video.

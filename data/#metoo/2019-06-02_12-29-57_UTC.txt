What Motivated my @elc_australia Social Media Influencer Mentorship Program Application:

1) It combines my creative talent, strengths, enjoyment in something that doesn't even feel like work.

2) I find the Global Phenomena of Social Media extremely fascinating
everything from the evolving techonology, to the psychology behind marketing and advertising strategies and even sociological aspect of how one single niche under current can over turn trends based on mainstream socio-political norms.  E.g. #MeToo #LoveIsLove @kimkardashian influence over #BodyImage

3)The opportunity to grow both creatively and professionally and opening doors in career progression.

4)Social Responsibility - I want to be a Influencer worthy of commanding Influence.  By this I would strive to be an influencer that encourages positive values and actions whether it be cultural, philanthropic, environmental or economic.

5) Finally cause I love Beautiful things and Beauty Products and enjoy retelling the stories in my own unique perspective.

NYC broke me, shattered me, humbled me down, ripped me apart and left me heartbroken. But thanks to that experience I GOT MY FIRST PRINCIPLE ACTING ROLE with a theatre company that travels nationally/internationally to showcase stories and teach about social issues to young people. .

I’ll be playing the lead role of Judge Xiomara Torres and I’m grateful for this unexpected opportunity. It all happened so quickly I still can’t believe it. I just signed my contract and I’m so excited to start living my dream (advancing my acting career) in a few weeks. Judge Torres is an original play, written by Milta Ortiz and directed by Mandana Khoshnevisan, based on the life of Judge Xiomara Torres. .

Background: Judge Xiomara Torres was an immigrant who fled a 12-year Salvadoran war and under harsh family circumstances ended up in foster care, but managed to pursue higher education and attended law school. Governor Brown appointed her as a judge in 2017, and she later revealed that she was not only abused by a relative, but sexually assaulted. Judge Torres joined the #MeToo movement when she opened up about being molested as a child and called women and men who spoke up before and alongside her brave for doing that. “‘It’s very important for society to see these very strong women speaking out ... to see these women who succeed in their careers, succeed in motherhood,’ said Torres, 47. ‘It changes the perspective from ‘victim’ to 'you are someone who has overcome.’”

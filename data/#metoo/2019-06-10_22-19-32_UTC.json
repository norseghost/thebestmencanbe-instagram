Like traveling the world is easy. Like personal development is easy. Like overcoming struggles and chasing dreams is easy.\n.\nYou get my point!!\n.\nThe thing is.. nothing is easy. There are always going to be struggles and hurdles!\n.\nYou overcome one thing and in comes another! You get everything planned out and organized and then the unthinkable happens!\n.\nYou can complain about it and look at other people with jealous or resentful eyes.. but the truth is:\n1) they still have struggles too\n2) of their life looks \u201ceasier\u201d, most likely they\u2019ve just continuously pushed through the struggles to get to where they wanted to be.\n.\nA couple weeks ago one of my clients said something that really stuck with me and hit me in the feels.\n.\nShe said \u201cKara, I love that no matter what goes wrong you are always looking for an answer and a way through. You get back up and try again and again until something works. It inspires me to push through whenever I\u2019m feeling stuck and I think \u2018what would Kara do\u2019?!\u201d\n.\nHonestly I don\u2019t think I\u2019d realized it or given myself enough credit but pushing through really has been the theme of my life!\n.\nAnxieties and insecurities. Losing my brother. Sexual assault. Traumatic car accident. Missed opportunities. Starting and failing a business. Starting and struggling to build a second business. Injuries and surgeries. Doors being closed.\n...\nThe only way out is THROUGH. The reason sometimes it looks like life is \u201ceasy\u201d and I\u2019m so happy is because I chose to push through those things until I could make them right, or make them hurt less, or find the releasing and healing I needed!\n.\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had a ton of hurdles to overcome in your life too. We\u2019ve all had them piling up over the years!\n.\nThe biggest secret to success in ANY area of your life is to find a way through. Turn your struggles into strength and you cannot fail. You can only grow bigger and bigger \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\n.\nTell me - are you going to find your way through?!"

It’s release day for a wonderful new women’s novel by @jenniferweinerwrites. Mrs. Everything is about two sisters, Jo and Beth (yes, we are also thinking of two other sisters by those names!), who lead two very different lives, one traditional and one not at all. Their stories, which span decades from the 1950s to now, deal with many of the issues women face today, from women’s lib to the #metoo movement, from pregnancy to breast cancer. It’s an important novel that pushes the envelope in a very real way, and explores the difficulties of trying to be “Mrs. Everything.” Let The Snail know of you need a copy and we will set one aside for you at our pop-up @rooseveltandco. #mrseverything #newrelease #independentbookstore

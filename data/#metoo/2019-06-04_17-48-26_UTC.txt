Being a part of @upsettingrapeculture has been my strength and deepest vulnerability. Telling your story is one of the most powerful things you can do. Those who kept space with me, thank you.  These images are my story of acknowledging pain and letting go with thankfulness. Images by Shameeka Dream Thank you #themonumentquilt #metoo

/// HAPPY SUNDAY /// Not ONE, not TWO, but THREE @zanthiiau clients featured in Sunday's #CourierMail @couriermail / #SundayMail @uonsunday #magazine!! I read the "How We Met" column religiously every week, and I just knew Tracey Horton - Author, Presenter & Public Speaker and Suzi Dent Mrs Earth Australia 2017 Inspirational Speaker were the perfect candidates to be featured.

Thank you so much to Sunday Mail columnist Jane Armitstead for running with this story - it's a fabulous read x

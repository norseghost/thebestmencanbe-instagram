It is LGBT Pride month! At the moment the community is facing alot of homophobia with the "Boston straight pride match" being accepted upon request, and the threats of banning LGBT Pride because of the inclusivity. This is disgusting as it's meant to be a time for the community to showcase how far we have come and commemorate the losses of people trying to equalise our community and unite us! Stay safe and be you!  Happy pride month! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 DM's are open.

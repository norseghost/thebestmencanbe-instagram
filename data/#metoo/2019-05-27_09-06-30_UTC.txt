If confronted with their behaviour, some unintentional bullies attempt to minimise or deny it.
They often think that they may have said something similar to what you recall, but they won’t recall their tone the same way you do. The lack or lapse of self-awareness they had in order to begin the bullying behaviour won’t always suddenly appear when they’re asked to explain themselves.
˙
Whichever type of bullying you have experienced, you’re not responsible for starting it; however, you’re the only person who can finish it. We have only three options when it comes to a difficult situation:
˙
1. Learn to like it.
2. Try to change it.
3. Leave it.

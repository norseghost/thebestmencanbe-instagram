Happy 100th anniversary to the passage of the 19th amendment in Congress. 
But we must not forget, our sisters of color did not get to exercise their right to vote until almost 50 years later. Millions of women are sharing their stories through the #MeToo and #YouKnowMe movements and starting real and personal conversations about a womenâ€™s right to make decisions for her own body, that show everyday we are nowhere near close to being done. 
Today and everyday we must #BelieveWomen and fight for all who identify as women. 
The Young Democrats of Seminole County condemns all sexism, behavior, policies and people that are anti-women.

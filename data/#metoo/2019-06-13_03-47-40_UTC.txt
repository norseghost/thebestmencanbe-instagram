THIS. This is real, for women everywhere. My proof is in the second photo. It is a screenshot from someone I know, who I counted as a trustworthy friend. He’s married. I’m married. And he said this to me. Today. In a private message. It is NOT okay. I don’t even know how to respond. I’m disgusted. And it makes me even more wary of men in general. Doesn’t matter what I was wearing in the photo to which he was referring to. Men do not have the right to make comments of a sexual nature to any woman who obviously does not reciprocate those feelings. Check yourselves little boys. Watch your mouth. You have no right to make comments like that. No right. #stopcommentingonwomen #hownottobeaman #womenarepeople #shutupmen #shutuplittleboy #disgusting #embarrassing #uncomfortable #metoo #frightening #pervertsgiverealmenabadname #watchyourmouth #why #trustnoone #donotbethatguy

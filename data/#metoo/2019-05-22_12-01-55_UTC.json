                        "text": "Thank you @simonschusterca for accepting my request on @netgalley to read and review \"Mrs. Everything\" by Jennifer Weiner. PUBLICATION DATE: June 11th 2019.\n.\n.\n\"Mrs.Eveything\" is a novel that follows two sisters throughout their whole life. Their stories bring into light hard times that women face and have faced our whole lives- sex, abuse, rape, abortions, motherhood, sexuality, and even expectations of being a woman. You name it and Jennifer Weiner covered it in this novel. That's why I enjoy novels that follow the characters throughout their whole life and not just a few years. We get to see what happened, how they live with what happened and how it has changed them. Even though this novel is fictional, everything that happened in it is happening to women all over the world, even today. That's why I believe that \"Mrs. Everything\" was a beautiful story and couldn't come out at a better time. So many women are stepping forward these days with the #metoo movement. The world has changed alot since the 1950's but it still has a long way to go. I highly recommend this book, whether you like women's fiction or not (I usually don't)\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n.\n.\n#book #books #booksbooksbooks #booking #bookshelf #bookphotography #bibliophile #bookobsessed #booktag #booklover #booknerd #booksofinstagram #bookreview #igread #BookSharks #booksofig #booksandcoffee #bookstagrammer #bookaddict #bookstagram #bookcommunity #goodreads #bookblogger #bookclub #kindle #arc #mrseverything #jenniferweiner"

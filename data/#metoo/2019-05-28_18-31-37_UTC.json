                        "text": "Why I'm not anti-feminist\nCW: sexual assault\n\nI started seriously questioning anti-feminism when the #MeToo movement picked up. Hearing stories from victims really got me questioning my own experiences and I started digging up traumatic memories of sexual assault that I've been repressing for years.\n\nThe truth is that I didn't know what I'd suffered was technically assault, because no one had taught me what consent really looks and sounds like (consent is still an incredibly vague subject in most sex ed classes and is hardly even mentioned).\nWhen I realized that I needed to stand up for other unheard victims like myself, I was totally shocked by the resistance coming from men's rights activism and their reluctance to \"believe victims\". It hurt me so much knowing a lot of my former friends were making rape jokes at the expense of survivors, and they'd question and doubt me if I had opened up to them.\n\nI noticed that it wasn't just my voice they were ignoring; we all have been ignoring so many marginalized voices for so long. I started seeing the purpose of intersectionality and listening to voices I'd been shutting out for too long.\n\nWhat I quickly realized about anti-feminism is that it's been around since the dawn of feminism, but it hasn't ever done anything productive to help people. It's only ever complained about the accomplishments of feminism. While feminism aims to amplify voices in the real world, anti-feminism only aims to silence voices.\nWhere feminism aims to draw attention towards the intersections of oppression, anti-feminism says \"you're not oppressed\".\nI'm lucky to have learned from this and not still be stuck in the same anti-feminist shithole from 2016.\n\nTo the voices I've silenced: I'm sorry."

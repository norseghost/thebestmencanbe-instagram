My very amazing medal and bib holder, the shoe that is painted on is my very first show I ran my first 5k & 10k in, my @brooksrunning PureGrit 5’s. I will forever be thankful for #brooksrunning shoes and the confidence they give me to safely and comfortably put my miles in. Handmade by @bodinehn or HBReynoldsArt (on Facebook) ❤️

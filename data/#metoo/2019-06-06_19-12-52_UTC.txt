In 2017, I wrote and performed my solo show Shattered. It was a story I never wanted to tell, but has become my most important conversation piece. 
Now, I'm taking @shatteredsolo to the biggest Fringe Festival in the world - The Edinburgh Fringe Festival! And I need your help to get there! Link in bio ðŸ’• 
Shattered is directed by @soaringsoloartist

Love this piece by @abiwonderbread for its subject matter, how it is a piece with healing and connection embedded as well as awareness of vivisection. See her feed for closeups! 😻😻😻

I did this bead embroidery as a meditation on recovery from assault and abuse. The two subjects have been vivisected, exposed, damaged, but they are on a journey together, guiding and helping each other. I wanted the beadwork itself to be disorganized, messy, and wild. -

💎MUST READ💎 Comment with a “♥️” to show this young lady some love for being so brave today. Her story has struck me more then any other I’ve ever encountered in my shop. The “before” photo represents her mother who at one time was this girls best friend. This was my clients dedication and tribute to her mom. This woman was supposed to protect her daughter. And let her down by getting back together with the man who sexually assaulted her while she grew up as a child. Her mother chose her abuser-and knew about it-over one of the sweetest, most precious and darling people I have honestly ever met. Her relationship with her mother faded, and it was time to stop looking at a reminder of daily hurt. It was time to turn the vicious past into a beautiful bright future with a reminder that she is as bright and wondrous as that beautiful new rose and the stars that shine behind and with it. She made me lose my cool and tear up when I heard her break down and start sniffling as she held her arm looking at her new tattoo. All I could do was grab her up and hug her and tell her she did so good and it’s over, no more bad days to look down upon. I can’t explain her to you all. What a treasure of a human being. IM the lucky one to have met her. She never once dropped her smile, was sweeter then a sugar pie, had the most gentle spirit, and was so incredibly...peaceful. She reminded me of why I do my job. That I help people with their legacies while leaving mine. And that no matter WHAT you’re going through, that is is going to be okay. Everyone’s trauma will lead to light one day. We just have to make it through. Thank you A for helping with a milestone moment of change for me and resetting my understanding of what this was all about when I began my job. #metoo #rosetattoo #rosestattoo #rosetattoos #flowertattoos #flowertattoo #floraltattoo #naturetattoo #outdoorstattoo #spacetattoo #galaxytattoo #universetattoo #startattoos #nighttattoo #tattooredo #tattoorework #reworktattoo #tattoocoverup #coveruptattoo #freehandtattoo #brighttattoo #colorfultattoo #tattoosforgirls #femaletattooartist #aztattooer #aztattooartists #arizonatattooer #arizonatattooartist #arizonatattoo

Teching for @mcgrath.annie tonight, her story about being flashed by strangers brought out a great comment from the audience - women always feel bad about ourselves after this kind of thing but it's the flashers who we should feel sorry for. Loads of interesting Edinburgh Fringe comedy previews happening @nordenfarm at the moment!! #beingawoman #feminism #creepymen #femalecomics #imwithher #metoo

Growing up during the summer on the weekends we would get up early Saturday mornings and hit up yard sales! Now that I have my own family it is still one of my fave things to do! Lately Kyle and I have been getting some steals, including some toys for our little man.Which is why I wanted to share with y’all one of my #momhacks!

All you need is some Thieves Household Cleaner concentrates and a bath tub! Fill her up  and add in a capful of the cleaner! I actually did half a capful  because I was doing a small batch in the kitchen sink 🤣 
So why Thieves Cleaner?
It is a plant based, all natural and infused with the kick butt power of essential oils! I seriously clean my house top to bottom with just this bottle! It is also so safe it says if ingested drink water to dilute the oils! As a mama that peace of mind is priceless! Trust me the minimalist and crunchy mama in you will love it! 
Who is getting theirs for free this month with their kit! 😱 and that glass bottle! I’m so jelly 🤣😍

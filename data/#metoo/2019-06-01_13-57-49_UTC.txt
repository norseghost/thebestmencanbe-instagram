I have tip toed around this subject for awhile now. Some of you know, some of you have guessed and have been there for me. <much appreciated>
I am not going to sugar coat it... it is going to be a rough read.
I have struggled with my body healing from being raped and beaten.
My body reacted bad to all the medicine I was put on to heal my body and prevent diseases.
My courage was taken from me to go to work, to go to the fucking grocery store to buy food because I couldn’t be near a man... because I didn’t have a face to go with my abuser so EVER MAN scared the fuck out of me. <I know his face now>
I tried to be brave and act normal and do normal activities... I’ve had a panic attack at my daughters catholic school where I volunteered to help out at a lunch because there was too much activity.
I pushed a man in the grocery store for accidentally bumping into me.
Lilla’s last day of school picnic I struggled to mingle like my normal self. 
Last night at lilla’s dance rehearsal I had a panic attack because of the amount of people and the rush of getting kids changed and set for stage. 
And having to tell Lilla that mommy can’t be around people or have too many hugs has been a bitch. 
I have drank too much. Not drank at all. Ate my feelings. Not eaten for days. Tried to be normal. Quit my job. Been mean to people. Been a bitch to my friends. 
A few of you have noticed that I completely stopped posting and am not in my stories like normal and have reached out. Thank you.
Yesterday I went for a run to clear my head and ran until I cried. Because... wtf was it about me that night that HE thought I was easy prey?
I am aware it isn’t my fault. But something made him think he could do this to me and I want to know what it was that I did to make him want to fuck up my whole world? 
I got home and scrolled Pinterest... that’s basically all I do now. And I came across my tattoo idea and a light bulb went off... I’m a mother fucking survivor of some shit! 
I asked y’all in my stories last night to stop sending me strength because damn... I don’t need anymore lessons on being strong. I asked for peace. But I don’t want that either.

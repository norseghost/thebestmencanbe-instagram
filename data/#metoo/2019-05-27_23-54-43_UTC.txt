#repost from @pink ; my heart needed this today. ❤️ I’ve been isolated, shut off from the world trying to focus on getting this book out. I stopped taking care of myself for a minute. 🌸 Re-living our traumas is not for the faint of heart. But I have turned some pages (literally!) and am ready to get back on track emotionally and physically. 👍 If you’re processing a trauma or just need a reminder to love yourself as you are, I’m here to tell you - you are not alone. 😘 #amwriting #thatgalkiki #memoir #exstripper #abusesurviver #addiction #metoo #stronger

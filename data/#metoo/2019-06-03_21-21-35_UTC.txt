Thank you @hbo for this documentary. For bringing awareness to institutionalized protections of perpetrators and the inspiring resilience of survivors, who never should have needed this voice in the first place. Thank you Judge Rosemarie Aquilina for permitting 156 victim impact statements in court. #metoo

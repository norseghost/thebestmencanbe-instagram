I’m back in Northern Ireland this week, and on Tuesday I’ll be the keynote speaker at this event at @qubelfast Gender Network. #everydaysexism across media, sport & many workplaces. I’ll be talking about media portrayals of my 2008 rape in Belfast. And signing copies of #DarkChapter - spaces are FREE & bookable on Eventbrite! #belfast #northernireland #metoo #metoomovement #endvawg #strongertogether #feminism #activism #genderparity #genderequality

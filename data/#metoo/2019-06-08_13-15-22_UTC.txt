Justice for twinkle
In india crime against the child increased 
uptp 500% in the last 20 years .. What our government is doing? 
What our political leaders are doing ? 
Actually , what are we doing ?

We are doing nothing ! We are just taking a sip of tea and discussing about it !

Now its the time to move on from passive mode to active mode... Can we initialise a campaign to awake our dorment society ..? Can we persuade our government to being active on such criminal cases and makes stricts laws?

The people who are always shouting about the human rights and saving the accused !  Do they are blind from seeing the rights of a child ? 
1000 of criminals are in the prison but only 2-4 are hanged till now .
More criminals must be hanged.. do we create an environment where criminals just frightened with the thought of doing crime?

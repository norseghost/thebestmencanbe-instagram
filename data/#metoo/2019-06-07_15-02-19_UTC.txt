A new profile on the singer was published this Wednesday that detailed many aspects of the pop star’s life, including her own anecdote of being sexually harassed by former mega Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein. In it, Madonna says the movie producer "crossed lines" with her and that Weinstein was "incredibly sexually flirtatious and forward."

"Harvey crossed lines and boundaries and was incredibly sexually flirtatious and forward with me when we were working together; he was married at the time, and I certainly wasn't interested," she tells the NYT. "I was aware that he did the same with a lot of other women that I knew in the business. And we were all, 'Harvey gets to do that because he's got so much power and he's so successful, and his movies do so well, and everybody wants to work with him, so you have to put up with it.' So that was it."

Madonna says while she won’t praise a person’s downfall she’s happy justice is being served. "So when it happened, I was really like, 'Finally.' I wasn't cheering from the rafters because I'm never going to cheer for someone's demise. I don't think that's good karma anyway. But it was good that somebody who had been abusing his power for so many years was called out and held accountable."

It was recently reported that Weinstein reached a $44 million civil agreement with his accusers, former business partners, and other companies. Meanwhile, Weinstein maintains he did not commit these alleged crimes. @hiphopuncensoredinc #hiphopuncensored #hiphopnews #hiphopuncensorednews #news #hiphop

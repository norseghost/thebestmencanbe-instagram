Are some men for real?
First thing... I am not single. And I live with my Englishman @trevorhinchliffe here in Sweden.

And no...
I don't call strangers. My work is not that type.
And for the last bit...
I don't connect "my friends with strangers" either...
There is sites for that type of connections.

For f**k sake...
Learn to check the profile and don't expect you are "Gods gift to women".
You can write nice and comment or be flirty as long as you know where the line go.
But if some type of women (or men or whatever attracts you) turns you on it don't necessary mean we all are available for you.
Little tired getting similar or even worser messages just cause I dare show who I am and don't hide behind a private account.

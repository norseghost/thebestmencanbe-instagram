It’s no bloody wonder it’s so hard to know, let alone admit, we are angry.

If we feel guilt, fear or self-doubt about being angry, we tend to shut it down.

We don’t take action - except perhaps against ourselves - we don’t make waves, tell uncomfortable truths, honour our needs, use our voices, start revolutions.

A women comfortable in her anger is the most dangerous being on earth.

Anger has a creative intelligence, it often signals injustice and the energy of it drives change (see: feminism, #blacklivesmatter, #metoo, #extinctionrebellion). Change is difficult, messy, threatening. Power does not shift willingly. But from behind our screens, we can see the benefits of this anger-driven public change.

Privately its so much trickier, because the sources of our anger are often not systems of oppression, but our loved ones, our work colleagues, people on social media.

If learned guilt, fear and self-doubt makes us question ourselves, we’ll often invalidate our experience of anger: ’is my anger legitimate?’ ‘Do I have a right to be angry?’ ‘What’s the use of getting angry?’ ‘I don’t want to be an angry person’. When we silence ourselves, it’s usually because we believe anger is wrong or bad or overwhelming.

But your anger is a creative force that can drive positive change in your life, work and relationships. Allowing anger doesn’t mean venting thoughtlessly or destructively. It means paying attention.

What is your anger telling you?

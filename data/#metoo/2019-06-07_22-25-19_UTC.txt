Instead of telling little girls they can’t walk around at night, they have to watch how they dress, they have to watch their drink, and they have to learn to protect themselves....how about we start telling little boys that girls and women are not objects and if they assault someone, it is their fault, not the victim’s. Just a thought....🧐 Tell them, not us. #metoo #womensrights #womenempowerment #sexualassault #stoprapeculture #notourfault #women

From our partner, @missionrecruit:
For every person that Mission Recruit successfully places into a career, we donate a Career Starter Kit to a survivor of domestic violence or sex trafficking. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We believe that every survivor should feel the part when she steps into her new role, and that's why we've carefully curated a Career Starter Kit with professional attire to ensure that she feels dressed for success.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Each kit includes a tote and wallet, a pair of dress shoes, a pair of dress pants, and two dress shirts from our partner @dksuitcity and @dkwomen. Our kits also include a necklace by @tayocollective, a jewelry company and social enterprise that hires survivors of sex trafficking and pays them a living wage while they care for their families and prepare for the future.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We're so proud of our mission and look forward to helping create more career placements that benefit both the candidate and the community. #supportsurvivors

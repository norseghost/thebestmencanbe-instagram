Episode 3 is live in the cut! And we’re talking to the president of @teampicmo, Wendy Cohen. A purpose-driven film distribution company that has gotten incredible films like Lion, Fed Up, Won’t You Be My Neighbor, and nearly a hundred others onto our screens. Beyond just getting films to the right audiences, Picture Motion creates innovative and actionable plans for us to take part in the pressing issues these movies and documentaries highlight. And it all starts with community. Listen, share, and support their Good Work!

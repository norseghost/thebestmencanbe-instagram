#metoo Movement Creator, Tarana Burke, just posted a moving tribute to the man who loved and parented her. It touched me deeply. God has a wonderful way of loving us perfectly through imperfect vessels. God has a wonderful way of growing us up in circumstances not of our choosing, and usually not to our liking, that shape us into the visionaries, healers, teachers, and miracle-workers God has sent us here to be. I have posted her reflection here, as well as my own response that I left on her post. We don’t love perfectly. Nor do we receive it perfectly. But there is a coming day when we will both know and be known to the fullest degree. On that day, love will be perfect—given and received fully and deeply, without flaw. In the meantime, we let the love we know now shelter, push, and transform us for the love we in turn become equipped to offer others. ❤️

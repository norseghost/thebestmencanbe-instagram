Let’s pause for a moment today and practice declaring God’s truth over ourselves.⠀
⠀
Repeat after me… “From this day forth, the best days of my life are ahead of me!”⠀
You guys know how adamantly I feel about the power of speaking words of LIFE. ⠀
⠀
One thing I’ve found helpful is inserting my name in a verse to make it personal. For example, the scripture: “No weapon formed against you will prosper.” ⠀
⠀
I’ll say, ”Andrea, no weapon formed against you will prosper!” We have a personal relationship with our God… so make it very personal!⠀
⠀
I truly believe our faith grows as we declare God’s word and allow it to renew our mind. After all, God created the world by declaring it, speaking it into being! ⠀
⠀
What verse are you speaking over yourself today? Let me know in the comments. <3

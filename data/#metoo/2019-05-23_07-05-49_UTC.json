Then, two weeks later, and completely out of the blue, the man who raped me sent me text messages from his adopted home abroad.\n\nThose messages amounted to an apology and a confession for what he had done to me. With trembling hands and voice, I finally reported the rape to the City of London Police in the belief I now had irrefutable proof of my sexual assault.\n\nFast forward three years, I\u2019ve now discovered I was naive to believe that a voluntarily written admission of rape amounts to prosecutable evidence in the eyes of the UK\u2019s so-called justice system. After a two-year police investigation and another year appealing the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s (CPS) decision not to charge the rapist, my solicitors at the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice informed me that my case has reached a dead end.\n\nThe man who raped me and confessed to it will never be extradited and arrested, never be questioned by British police, never be charged, and never be brought to trial.\n\nMy case is one of several in a growing dossier being collated by the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice in order to launch a lawsuit against the CPS for dropping so-called 'weak cases' en masse.\" Read more: http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rape-metoo-me-too-rapist-confession-police-cps-a8918886.html\n\n#MeToo #TimesUp #TimesUpNow #sexualassault #sexualabuse #sexualviolence #rape #rapeculture #violenceagainstwomen #VAW #genderbasedviolence #GBV #stopsexualassault #stopsexualabuse #stopsexualviolence #stoprape #stoprapeculture #stopviolenceagainstwomen #stopVAW #stopgenderbasedviolence #stopGBV #endsexualassault #endsexualabuse #endsexualviolence #endrape #endrapeculture #endviolenceagainstwomen #endVAW #endgenderbasedviolence #endGBV"

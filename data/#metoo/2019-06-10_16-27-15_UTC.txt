It's time to stop letting the enemy deceive us. It's time to stop listening to the lies he tells us. It's time to "take out the trash" in our minds. Do your thoughts ever sound like this?
"I'm not good enough"
"I don't deserve to be loved"
"I'm a loser"
"No one will ever love me"
"I'm not worthy"
"I'm powerless"
"There's no hope for me"
"I'll never make it"
Etc...
Those are literally LIES from the enemy himself. And it may even sound like your own voice! But it's him. He's deceiving you. Trust me I battle with these thoughts all the time. I'm so sick of it!
.
How can we fight these thoughts? There are days I have to play worship music ALL day in my office. There are days I wake up and fall to my knees in prayer. And there are days I have to speak truth out loud to myself throughout the day. But when I let my guard down and think I'm good, that's when the thoughts come again. We have to fight every day. We have to stay alert!
.
I find that I'm at peace and at rest in my soul and in my mind when I practice thankfulness, when I pray, when I practice meditating on God's word, and when I sing to Him. He is blessed when we practice these things and in turn it blesses us.
.
Then... We can start to feel the air in our minds get clearer... We can see the situation in our life becoming brighter... And we no longer feel the burden in our souls, we then feel peace and rest. So let's practice blessing God's name by practicing these little things every day.

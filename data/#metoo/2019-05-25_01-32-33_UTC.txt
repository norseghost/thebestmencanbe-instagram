I’m a firm believer that we were not made to live in isolation. ⠀
⠀
God is the one who said, “It is not good for man to be alone.” Without community, it would be easy for us to not live up to our full potential and fall into discouragement and even depression.⠀
⠀
I’m sharing one of my favorite examples of WHY having a trusted side-kick is so important in a quick blog post entitled, “We all need somebody.” I’m including a link in my bio!
⠀
I pray it encourages and challenges you today. <3

The Monument Quilt, displayed on the #NationalMall as a way to create awareness about ending rape culture and sexual violence. There are 3,000 quilt squares altogether, each the work of a survivor. Claire’s square is pictured here. I’m so proud of her for what she’s created and for her wanting to participate. She worked on this square, on and off, for a few years. Please join us in spirit as we travel to DC to view The Monument Quilt. I’m praying the quilt will create opportunities for healing for many. It is to be on display only until Monday.

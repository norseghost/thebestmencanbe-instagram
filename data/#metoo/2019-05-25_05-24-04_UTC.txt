TRIGGER WARNING: RAPE/SEXUAL ABUSE/MOLESTATION

Not many people know about the trauma I've endured in my lifetime. Some may know bits and pieces, but not the big pieces. In light of all of the abortion/birth control bans, I'm going to share my story. Hopefully, it helps, even if it's just a little bit.
************
When i was 5, there was a "clubhouse" my dad built in the back yard of our house on Edward Street. It was a plain building; no glass windows, no door. 2 people, that were very close to me at the time, decided we were going to play a "game." The object of the "game", was to put their penises in my mouth and suck it like a lollipop for as long as I could or until they had ejaculated. I remember the salty taste in my mouth and it burned my throat and made my eyes water. I was wearing a bathing suit. Another such time, I was told i had to "pinky swear" that i wouldn't tell mom and dad about this new game. This game, was to lay on my back and close my eyes. They used plastic sandwich bags in place of a condom. Again, i was 5.
***************
I will share one more experience before i end my rant, however, i will never stop talking about things I'm passionate about.
***************
My ex boyfriend that i left in december did not like "no" for an answer. He would beg and plead and cry and guilt trip me until i said yes and i would lay face down, screaming and crying into a pillow. He would often times wait until i was sleeping to remove my underwear and i would wake up to him on top of me, thrusting.
*****************
These are only 2 of the pieces of my past. I've tried my hardest to forget. These instances do not make me any less worthy of love and respect.

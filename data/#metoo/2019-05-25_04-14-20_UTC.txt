We are trained to keep our feelings hidden from others so that they can't attack us when we're vulnerable. I find it extremely healing to be open and honest about our feelings and I recommend that we all try it as much as possible!
.
One reason is that we invite intimacy and connection with others because we are showing them who we are and we invite them to do the same.
.
Another is that we are allowing others to know that we are kindred spirits in the fact that we all feel these types of feelings together, whether or not we show them outwardly!

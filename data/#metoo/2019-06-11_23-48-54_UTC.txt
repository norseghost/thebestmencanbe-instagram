#reckoning is the first published history of the #metoo movement. It’s a fascinating history of the shift between 1970s - when various black women were finally able to take a stand against abusive employers & 2018, when between @gretchencarlson’a lawsuit and @jodikantor’s investigation, blew open the problems all women face in workplaces everywhere. If you like #history or #herstory or if you have your eye on presidential candidate @joebiden and you’d like a perspective on his history in the women’s movement ... this is the book for you. Thanks journalism legend #MargaretSullivan for taking the stage at the legendary @strandbookstore.

@metooethiopia In a healthy relationship, there is trust, honesty, compassion, forgiveness, respect and communication. Above all, there are boundaries – both emotional and physical. One person in the relationship communicates their boundaries, and in return, the other respects these set boundaries.

In a relationship where there is no respect or value of your emotional and physical health, and boundaries have either never been set or are constantly violated and not respected, the victim finds it hard to stand strong against what they believe in for the sake of “love.” Statistically, 80% of domestic violence comes from one person in the relationship;
20% from both people in the relationship.

A warped sense of love has been affected by the cycle of abuse. The cycle of abuse often loops from explosion, to a calm lull, to tension. The cycle is then repeated over and over by the abuser. Often, phrases such as, “I’m sorry, take me back” or occasionally, “This is all your fault. You need to do better!” are used to keep the cycle going. Don’t be deceived. Abusers will use many different things to control: sex, privilege, gifts (buying your affection and trust, big promises), technology (monitoring your calls, texts, Facebook, voicemail), intimidation (stalking, harassment), threats (“If you leave me I’ll _____,” “If you do this I’ll_____,”), your spiritual, emotional and physical well-being. None of these things equal love.

I’ve been thinking a lot about my recovery,  about where I was Immediately after the years of sexual abuse to where I am today, the struggle the shame and all that goes along with it, as well as the victories and the mountains conquered. The thing that I continue to struggle with is “what part of me did I lose” in those 3 to 4 year of constant trauma? Not that I can reclaim it, but  the power of suppressing memories still has its grip on me. Like my shadow, I know I’ll never be able to escape it. #metoo #memories #struggle #mentoo #survivor #solaceinchaos #amazonbooks #bookstagram #author #losangeles #paris #london #canada #spain @hbo @strandbookstore @outlier_stories @lifetimemovies @nytbooks @netflixfilm @

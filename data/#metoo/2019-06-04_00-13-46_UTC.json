A picture doesn\u2019t tell you the story. It\u2019s easy to judge a picture that can mean so much to someone. This picture means a lot to me. It represents results - healthy results mind, body, and soul. I FEEL better. I\u2019m slowly coming out of the fog from baby three and 18 months of a breastfeeding journey that has come to an end. I\u2019m loving my body every step of the way for the first time in my entire life. So yeah, maybe I found a way to feel better in my own skin- but I assure you this is not a \u201cdiet thing\u201d\ud83d\udc97 \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb I find it so interesting that so many people talk about creating long term lifestyle changes and searching for a way to truly feel good, live healthier, and reach health goals for themselves and their family BUT then look at my lifestyle and call it a \u201cfad diet\u201d or a \u201cquick fix\u201d. I have to believe there is a breakdown of education and miss information happening. My favorite \u201care you really going to drink those shakes forever?\u201d OR \u201cI prefer real Whole Foods\u201d #metoo! If you understood- you\u2019d probably want to incorporate this nutrition in your or your families life in one form or another too! It\u2019s nutrition that helps an elite athlete perform their best and at the same time helps a mama who\u2019s growing life in her belly. It\u2019s nutrition, back by science, and gives results you can\u2019t get anywhere else. Yes- it\u2019s true. \u2022\nIt\u2019s been 4 1/2 years you guys. Over 4 years of this LIFESTYLE. I use full meal replacement smoothies in many different ways to consume the nutrition. We make shakes, we bake, we get creative! My WHOLE family consumes this nutrition daily! I take high quality daily vitamins and minerals with telomere support every single day. I use high quality probiotics and digestive enzymes- (GAME CHANGER FOR MY GUT HEALTH) I eat REAL food and honestl"

                        "text": "It would seem that we are in a Golden Age for the genre formerly known as \u201cteen movie\u201d, where classics of old were the likes of #animalhouse #American Pie & more recently #superbad , we are now faced with films that are as funny as those (largely) \u201cgross-out\u201d hits but also have a great deal more brain behind the crude language & bodily fluids. Of course it helps that in the age of movements such as #metoo we are now seeing the female characters given as much depth & screen time as their male counterparts, more than mere trophies to be won (to put it charitably), though it\u2019s certainly important to note that their have been significant examples of this pre-\u201cme too\u201d in the past, see #10thingsihateaboutyou for example\u2026\nWhich funnily enough is where #booksmart could be easily positioned, as good as that fine genre example it adds new layers & introduces audiences to a two burgeoning new stars in #kaitlyndever & #beaniefeldstein & one rather unexpected directorial talent to watch in actress #oliviawilde (#tronlegacy & #rush) as she steps behind the camera for her hugely confident directorial debut. The trailer for Booksmart is unlikely to do it any favours, indeed it has underperformed at the box office where counter-programming against the likes of John Wick & Aladdin seem to have failed, positing it as \u201cSuperbad with girls\u201d placing a focus on the cruder aspects, a producer credit for #willferrell & the fact that Feldstein is #jonahhill \u2019s sister also unlikely to do it any favours on that front either, putting all that pretence aside however & viewed with a fresh pair of eyes there is so so much to enjoy & admire.\nTonally I was reminded of not only 10 Things, but far more fresh in the memory, #netflix excellent series #sexeducation , it\u2019s a film with a similar amount of heart to balance the humour which (it is important to note) is a masterful blend of many types, not just sexual, though that particular brand does yield at least 4 hilariously memorable set-pieces, not least a mix-up in a taxi involving porn & an AV adapter!!! This though is just an example of the film\u2019s surface pleasures (so to speak!), dig a little deeper, & the deeper still & you can peel away the"

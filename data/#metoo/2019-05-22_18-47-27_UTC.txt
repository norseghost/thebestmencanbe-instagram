I just shared my story and presented for THREE STRAIGHT HOURS to 225 professionals who work with sex offenders in New York State... therapists, psychologists, healthcare workers, law enforcement. Whew, bring me 4 gallons of coffee and a dark padded room, please and thank you. 
I love bringing the survivor perspective to these conferences though because I walk in feeling so inadequate but leave feeling really hopeful. 
BECAUSE: They need me. I need them. We are all working toward the 
SAME GOAL: prevention of sexual abuse. 
So many grown professionals were in tears, saying they’ve never heard a survivor share their story and they needed it today... wow. 
REMINDER: Our voices matter. To everyone. To both sides. To all the lanes. So, keep finding your voices, friends. Our stories truly can make a difference. 
PS a 55 yo healthcare professional hugged my neck, sobbing and said “me too” for the first time in her life today. Precious moment for us both. 
It’s never.too.late.to.tell. 
xo thanks for your love and support... that wraps up my spring tour, folks! It’s bout to be airplane naptime for me zzzz

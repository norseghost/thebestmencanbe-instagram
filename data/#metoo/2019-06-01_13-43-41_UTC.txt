Ladies you are no ones punching bag,let no one abuse you physically, emotionally,  Psychologically, verbally, financially, sexually. Tell someone you trust.Fear NO man but GOD. Go to God First in pray , and tell him all about your problems. File a police report ( if the predator is in Law enforcement go above them) share it on social media, your church , family, employer,hotlines. Something. Never be ashamed. Never.Never be Silent. Unfortunately, but Fortunately..I had to do all of the above in July 01 2017 #iamrosadavis #rosaspeaks @lifetimetv #empoweredwomenempowerwomen #myministrymypurpose #padv @tvonetv #domesticviolenceawareness #victorious #claytoncounty #georgia #atlanta #hamptonga  @chrisstewart_esq_  @attorneycrump @leemerrittesq @shaunking @tylerperry @tyler.perry.studios @lisabloomesq @11alive @claytoncountypolice @essence @sistercircletv @huffpostwomen @marsyslawforga #aclosedmouthwillgetyounowhere #helpyourself #metoo @atty_daryl_washington @gbi_ga @officialdfmi @thejusticedept @fbi

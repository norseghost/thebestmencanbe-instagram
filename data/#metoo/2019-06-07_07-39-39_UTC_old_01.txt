The pride month is coming, and we all be here, coming out to celebrate us, freedom and love.
The pride parade was never invented as a celebration. Culminating tens of years of fight for human rights, LGBT+ community members were followed, tortured, murdered in the concentration camps, humiliated, hereby we are coming to say we broke free to be who we are, not to afraid anymore to hold a hand of a person you love the most in public, to celebrate marriage and to build equal families. 
Coming from the country of Kazakhstan that puts LGBT+ community in the grey zone, giving to the homophobic people and governmental organs full allowance to mistreat people, as in all the post Soviet countries. 
On my own terrible experience, being blackmailed by police until I paid huge amount of money, hopefully made them forget about me. I'd love to advise to those queer people, just run away out of there. Run by studying abroad, escape by finding a job anywhere in the world that respect you as human beings, but you have no possibility or opportunity otherwise run as LGBT+ refugee. 
It is hard, it is complicated, but if you want to live your full life dont give them rock you.
I wish all of you a happy pride month.
I wish freedom to all my brothers and sisters all around the world.
#metoo - I am a running queer student, I am an escaping LGBT+ community expat and I am a looking for my rights gay refugee. 
Amen

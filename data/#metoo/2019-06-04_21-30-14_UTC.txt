Everyone has a story that someone needs to hear. I struggle with feeling alone in my personal struggles and inner battles but I have learned that I am not alone through the women brave enough to open up in their interviews. This weeks podcast is a special collaboration with @unconventional_shell and her Intimate Conversations event. It’s interviews from black women about their experiences with sexual violence, abuse and the everyday fear/stigmas women deal with in that area. I’m nervous but excited to try something different with the podcast!! I hope this inspires YOU to share your story. #theinimitableblackwoman

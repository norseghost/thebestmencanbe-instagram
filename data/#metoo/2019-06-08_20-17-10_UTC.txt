This is where the real work is: when you’re sitting in front of someone who has tried so hard to destroy your life, lie about it and make it look like it’s “all in your head” by acting like nothing is wrong...the ability to not choke them to death and instead find the love in your heart for the life you had along with the compassion for the fact that they’re lost, they’re not awake to what life is really all about...and that even though your time together is over, there were lessons to learn and moments that had to happen. So hold those in your heart and be the woman you want to be, and don’t let the pain your ego is feeling be the thing that pulls you apart. What’s real is now, not the past, so move into your higher self when you feel challenged and called to reach deep down inside. ♥️💪🏼🎯

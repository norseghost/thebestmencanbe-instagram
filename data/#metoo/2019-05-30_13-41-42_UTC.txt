This video features the sand paintings I created for fashion week 2018 for designer @prabalgurung who based his designs largely inspired by the Masuo tribe in western China. Sand paintings were a natural fit and I loved playing off the patterns in the garments.  I made 3 paintings which were reflected in a large angled mirror at the foot of the runway.  There were 40 models presenting the garments  which included the Hadid Sisters @gigihadid @bellahadid  And @ashleygraham strutted the runway. In the midst of #metoo  it was Prabuls vision to embody feminine power through fashion color and textures “What I really loved was the absolute celebration of the femininity and empowerment. There is no suppression — it’s full on,” in the audience @tarana_burke @iamcardib @offsetyrn @whoopigoldberg @humaabedin  It was a very intense day to complete 3 paintings in the 5 hours that were allotted for the furious pace of fashion week but I improvised and played off the garments color palette and I’m very proud and pleased with the results. I would welcome the chance to work with designers in these ways and so many others 🙏🏼❤️💃🏼. To see these garments in person visit @prabalgurung  store at 367 Bleecker St NYC

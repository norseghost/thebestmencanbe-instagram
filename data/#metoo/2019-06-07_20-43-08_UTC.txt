#metoo #mentalhealthawareness : in an attempt to escape my anxiety today, I decided to dust off the bike. little did I know, several people would feel the need to verbally harass and threaten to physically assault me, just for being outside. 
this social problem weighs on my mind each summer, although I’ve never posted about it, as I know many women (and men) endure worse and physical experiences each day. it’s sad people around us feel entitled to making others feel unsafe. no one owes anyone a smile or conversation. those things are shared with people who respect others. my polite/fearful smile to your disrespect is not an invitation to further harass or threaten me. would you do the same to your sister, mother, or friend? please be kind to others.

p.s. when the world feels negative, practice tunnel vision and gratitude for the marvelous people in your life. there is still good in the world if you’re looking for it.

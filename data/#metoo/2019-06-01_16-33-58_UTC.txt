Trigger warning: mention of r/pe

. "Hm so I think it stems from the fact that I come from a family who deals with everything in a very traditional way and well a better word would be to say a censored way. No one talks about catcalls but they tell you to wear your dupatta and no one talks about rape but they tell you that girls get kidnapped kind of thing. It’s like this unspoken thing is an unrealistic event which can’t happen if you follow their guidelines. So if you say that it has happened, it comes down to the fact that you’re either lying or you didn’t follow the guidelines. 
I never came forward and I never reported because I’m very scared about being shot down about these kinds of things. I can stand ignorance and being dismissed on a lot of things but this is something which is very raw and fresh in my mind on which I can’t tolerate any kind of disbelief or cross questioning.

Then there’s a difference in our power positions. If it’s someone above me they have the power to wriggle out of it and defame me on the process which also remains true for popularity structures. Because someone with more popularity and more evident charisma can easily make the public believe what they want and turn a good portion of the student body/admin against me.  So I never took the risk." #whydidntireport #metoo #timesup ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

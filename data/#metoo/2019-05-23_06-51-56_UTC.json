                        "text": "The tender podcast.\n1 in 4 women will experience intimate partner violence in the US (NCADV), globally about 1 in 3 (WHO).\nAnd while there are many organisations targeting this issue, it\u2019s usually about the same three things: how to recognise abuse, how to prepare for leaving, leaving. Those are totally valid issues, don\u2019t get me wrong but concentrating on them leaves a large part of the problems people face after leaving undiscussed and to me it just always felt a bit strange. \nSo, when a close friend told me about the tender podcast by Madison Griffiths I was pretty sure it was going to be the same, or there\u2019d be detailed descriptions of how they were abused with harsh noises and lots of screaming for shock value. Because that\u2019s the other kind of \u201cresource\u201d there is, catering to those who like true crime but don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite raw enough. \nTender was very different from what I expected. It\u2019s soft, careful and discusses delicate issues with the necessary caution; and while listening I recognised myself in so many episodes. From struggling to get a haircut to unwanted phone calls to adopting a puppy to nightmares that just won\u2019t fade. And while I\u2019ve been putting off listening to the last two episodes of this season, I can only recommend this podcast to anyone who needs a friendly voice to tell them that they\u2019re not alone. This podcast is a great resource for those going through abuse, for those who left and for literally anyone who\u2019d like to understand their friend who\u2019s going through a tough time. \n@madisonrgriffiths \ud83c\udf08Ruth"

AND THEN THERE WAS A ROUGH CUT. Today was an exciting milestone in our process for @neverthelessfilm sharing the stories we’ve been swimming in with our first small group. “The stories are deeply moving and compelling and I love the diversity of subject and of their experiences. I feel angry and also like I want to take action.” Onward! #metoo #timesup #nevertheless

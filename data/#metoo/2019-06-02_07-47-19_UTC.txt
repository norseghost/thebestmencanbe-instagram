5 years ago, I started training WenDo trainers in Egypt so we can all spread together self confidence amongst girls. Since then around 50 trainers are constantly active, giving classes in youth centers, schools, refugee centers, gyms and so on. Thank you #germandevelopmentcooperation for making that possible.

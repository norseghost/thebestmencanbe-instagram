I'm really feeling this gorgeous pendant right now, especially with Pride upon us!! 😍 I can't believe someone hasn't grabbed this for themselves yet! 😮

You have any fun Pride events you are going to? I'm going to a fundraiser called Still Not Asking For It. It's a global fundraiser put on in more than 55 tattoo shops on the same day!! Here, it will be raising funds for the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault and is put on by the @dsmtattoocollective ❤️ I can't wait!!! #imgettingatattoo 😄🌈 #pridemonth #pride🌈 #iowapride #supportlocalart #tattoolove #metoo #stillnotaskingforit #stillnotaskingforit2019 #desmoinesartist #desmoinestattoo #desmoinesart #iowaartist #iowaart #midwestartist #midwestart #showyourpride #supportpride

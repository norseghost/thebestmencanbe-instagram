I refuse to take gun control ideas seriously that come from rich people who can afford walls around their house and armed security. I refuse to take serious someone who doesn’t have to worry about their own safety. I’m not going to listen to someone who lives in a gated community and has no need for a firearm to defend their family. You have no right to tell me what I can use, or what I need to do to buy it.

Don’t ever “ NoT aLl MeN” when women are expressing their fear of being attacked and raped. Their fear of domestic violence. Their fears for their safety. Get out there and speak up instead. Rape jokes from the boys? So not funny! Tell them that. Tell them it’s not acceptable! See your mate treating a woman like shit? Step in! Hear someone being an asshole to women, cat calling, making unsolicited comments? Speak up! Seriously if you are sick of men being lumped together start taking a stand against the men who give you a bad name!

I was like, \"I want to maybe run a possible idea by you in the future bc perhaps one day white liberals will be sane, perhaps, and youre the coolest person alive, so maybe you'll help me figure this out by text or smoke signal??\" And he was like, \"I'm in\" so now I name drop him for clout\n.\n\nLee has his own show on vice, so.. yeah. #willfuckforsocialprogress\n.\n\nAnd about NYU, they didn't \"kick me out\", Karen, the adminstration Dean, went into my account and withdrew my classes. For three semesters, NYU has been harrassing me, which ive documented here. Why? Remains unclear, likely bc I report ever instance of explicit or implict racism, which is logical. White people, particularly liberals like Karen, fail to understand the parameters of institutionalized racism, especially when it's implict\n.\n\nA bench mark of that behavior is \"the rebound effect\", in which white people \"get offended\" and replace ego with reason\n.\n\nI cant defend myself anymore. I am a straight a student, I follow every. Single. Rule (which is documented) but here is an example: walter, my cognitive behavioral professor is a racist, right? He says things like, \"so imagine youre a clinician, counseling a new mother. She's dying for that blue eyed blond haired baby. She comes home with a brown haired, brown eyed baby. She didn't fail, she just didn't succeed!\" Ok, fine. Gross, but who cares. People get to be racist. BUT, when it shows up in his exam? Questions designed around racialized primacy? We have an issue\n.\n\nSo i tell walter. Walter ignores me. I tell water again. Still avoidant. He calls the counseling center and pathologizes me. I think the counseling center is \"rational\" so I say, \"let's have a meeting?\" I structure the meeting around teaching implict bias (bc NYU openly admits they suffer from institutionalized racism). They cancel the meeting -- they *wanted* to, as a group, repurpose the narrative. That's unacceptable\n.\n\nshit like that has been my full experience at NYU. Why? \"Dismissiveness\" is a marker for liberal racism, which turns into ego\n."

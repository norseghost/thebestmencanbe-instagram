My first @youtube video is coming out tomorrow @ 11 pm EST

I wanted to share my journey to healing and be very candid about the past 10+ years of my life. |

Your #MentalHealth should always be a PRIORITY and if the people in your life have a hard time understanding that then focus on YOU rather than putting energy into “Making” someone see how IMPORTANT your mental well being is. |

The most EXHAUSTING thing you can do in your lifetime is live a life for everyone else but yourself. |

If you find something that makes you happy pursue it. If you have been blessed with a story and you have the strength and means to share it then do so. |

Basically, Take CARE of YOURSELF, do what makes YOU HAPPY, and most importantly PRAY for your loved ones that don’t understand what you’re going through and have FAITH that one day that’ll change.

Lots of love & until next time 💕

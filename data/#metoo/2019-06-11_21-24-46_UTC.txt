Update-----On May 22, 2019 (5/22/2019) HB3117 was signed by our Oregon state governor @oregongovbrown HB3117 changes the requirements for keeping an existing protective order in place. No longer does a petitioner have to prove fear for their life but instead now only has to prove reasonable fear against the respondent. It was declared an emergency;  because this bill was declared an emergency it is currently in effect! 
The good news is that SB995 has passed and is awaiting the governor's signature. This bill will remove time-restrictions for filing a restraining or sexual protective order.

The bad news is that the window extension that was the original entire purpose of our bill was removed before it passed. At no point was this communicated to us.

My husband is telling me to focus on the positive that now orders will be easier to obtain, and will not have unreasonable restriction windows once both laws are in effect. #justice #rapesurvivor #rapevictim #survivorofabuse #healingfromabuse #metoo #defendthsacred #murderedmissingindigenouswomen #mmiw #indigenouswomen #freedom #hope #courage #humanrights #humanrightsactivist #faith #quotes #pdxmodel #freepeople #postthepeople #zeiss #f4f #libra #giyim #2019

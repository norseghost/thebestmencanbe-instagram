âœ¨B O D I E Sâœ¨

We all have one. We all the right to our own; the right to what happens to them, who we share them with, how we share them, when and why. 
We all get to choose how to dress our bodies, what we will or won't wear. And it's no one's business or right to comment on that. â€¢
I recently recieved some disturbing emails insinuating I should be selling my body since I, "go braless" anyways. Upon putting them on blast, I also recieved online comments supporting this idea. â€¢
"You post half naked photos on your personal ig anyways, might as well make some money" â€¢
Not only is this inappropriate, disrespectful and disgusting, it's actually terrifying and dangerous.

Spot the difference between these two statements:
â€¢ "But did you see what she was wearing? She was asking for it." â€¢
"You go braless and don't care who sees your tits. I just want to see those melons. Aren't you a slut?" â€¢
Hint: there's not much difference. 
Both show entitlement to a woman's body. Both state that the way a woman dresses gives others the right to do what they want with them. This is the precise mentality keeping rape culture alive in our modern age. 
No matter what someone wears, no matter how someone acts, no matter how they choose to be present in the world, NO MATTER WHAT, you are NEVER entitled to someone else's body.

So here's me in a shirt that clearly shows my nipples, because I fucking chose to ðŸ–•
Slut shaming is SO over. It's 2019. Get with the times â€¢

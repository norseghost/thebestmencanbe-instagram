Repost @light.knowledge.power: “Rp @international_animal_rescue 🐻 ADOPT A RESCUED BEAR THIS FATHER’S DAY! 🐻

Are you looking for an extra special gift to give your dad this Father’s day? Our virtual bear adoptions make the perfect unique gift!

Adopt a rescued bear to show you care:

The sanctuaries in India are currently caring for more than 300 rescued bears who were saved from a life of suffering, being forced to dance on the streets for human entertainment.

With our partners Wildlife SOS we put an end to this cruel 400 year old tradition and rescued every single bear from the streets.

Now, they live out their days in peace and we are committed to giving them a safe haven (full of treats!) for the rest of their lives.

We made a promise to these bears, and we will never turn our backs on them – they deserve all the love in the world.

You can support the ongoing care of these bears through an online adoption. You will receive a wonderful adoption pack which includes a personalised certificate, a photograph, a soft toy (optional), a fact sheet and exclusive updates on your animals progress.

Our adoption packs make unique gifts and can be purchased as postal packs or online printable packs.

To adopt, visit the LINK IN @international_animal_rescue BIO!

Thank you. With your support, we can show these bears what it means to be loved.

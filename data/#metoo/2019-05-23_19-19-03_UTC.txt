CHOOSE YOUR POISON [Gates of Hell] - (2017)
New York City

In light of Bill Cosby's conviction today, I felt it was necessary to repost this image that I took in New York City. Beyond the paintings of Bill Cosby and Donald Trump, sat a gentleman in red, white and blue with his head down in the shadows, representing to me America looking the other way with the lack of morality. It struck me how and where we are today... Numb to the moral compasses that we've had in this country for centuries. These "Gates of Hell" as they appeared to me that day are the passageway into the darkness.

Whether a child "agreed to" or was forced into a sexual encounter with a perpetrator, the responsibility rests completely on the perpetrator. Actions classified as sexual abuse may be any of the following: Touching, rubbing, patting that arouses sexual pleasure; exposure to pornography; exposure to bathing/showering; exposure to intercourse/masturbation; exposure to nakedness/genitals; french kissing; videotaping without consent; intercourse, oral sex, or sodomy; and religious activities that include sex. How does your story relate to any of these actions of sexual abuse? #notjustahashtagpodcast

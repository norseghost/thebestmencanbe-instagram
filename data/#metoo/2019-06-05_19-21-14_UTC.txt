This is a post by ‘wistfulfern’, saying: “Honestly shoutout to people with anxiety and panic disorders, y’all don’t get enough recognition for your hard work. Pushing through your body’s instinct to fight/flee/freeze at the slightest worry is a whole new level of strength. You’re battling almost everyday against a fast-acting anamalistic response that humans have been experiencing since the dawn of time, a response that it literally designed to take full control of your actions away from You. That takes You so much courage and perseverance. You’re strong as fuck.”

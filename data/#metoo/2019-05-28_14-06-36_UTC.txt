Throwback love poem

Chastity's belt

Man's best friend is not the canine
But the woman!
How lovely she looks
In my passenger seat
Strapped in safely
With her face hanging out of the window
Breeze blowing through her hair
Tongue flapping in the wind.
Come to me my promised lover
Sit in my lap
I'll carress you and give you love
If you're a good girl for Daddy
Many treats I will feed you
And if you position yourself just right
Maybe then I will breed you.
Out of the kennel
And into the woods
To grandmother's house we go!
If you're good 
I'll remove your leash
We'll laugh and play in the snow!
I'm your personal Jesus
You're one and only savior
The one in times of guilt
Who helps
To rationalize your behavior.
In this personal hell of mine 
I've built
You are my most loyal friend
And resident
Perhaps after 40 years of training
You could even
Run for president!
Give to me your oowey gooey
Soft sassy posturing.
A rock for you I'll always be
Never will I soften!
Forever friends
Until the end
As long as you don't play me.
I'm not a dragon
My loyal hound
So why do you try to slay me?
I'm your master dressed in black
Get on your knees
And obey me
Boost me up
Until I'm big
Then
And 
Only
Then
Will I let you drain me.

She's my sidekick
Just with half the wit,
My cancerous paralysis
Taking half my shit.

Your emotions are your own
So don't blame me
For these feelings you have felt
You're a gold digger
I'm a pink digger
Tearing open Chastity's belt.

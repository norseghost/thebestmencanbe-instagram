You can judge me, you can put me down. You can ignore me completely. The ones who stand by and cheer on my happiness no matter what their opinions are, those are the ones who prove their true intentions. I am so thankful for the amazing people in my life that support me mentally and show me everyday how much they love me!

I have come a long way. I’ve experienced a lot of trauma, and I’ve fought many inner battles with myself because of it. I may not speak of my scars often or at all, but we all have them! I am happy I have been able to rise above my past and triumph. So can you!

I love the person I am today and I am excited to continue my personal growth as a strong and loving independent woman! I am kind, I am hard working, and I am full of love.  No more anxiety, no more pain, no more doubt. If anyone needs a shoulder, an ear, or advice, I am always happy to help. We must all stick together in such a dark world. It’s so easy to get lost!

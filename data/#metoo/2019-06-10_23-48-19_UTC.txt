So it is finally here ... I’m nervous but excited... because God said if I push then he’ll pull.... this podcast is for the women who feel inadequate, not good enough, less than, etc. the women who want to heal from that hurt... on this podcast will will dive deep into ourselves... so deep that we meet that broken little girl on the inside of us and have a face to face conversation with her about this new version of you... this woman you are trying to become... but in order to do so we have to go back to where this brokenness begins... heal from that place in order for us to step into what God truly has for us... #god  #podcast  #womenhelpingwomen  #selfcare #selflove #selfreflection  #growth #coachingespiritual  #motivationquotes  #metoo

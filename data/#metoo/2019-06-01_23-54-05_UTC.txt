For my winter fashion cover story/ M magazine/ The Age today, I wanted to work out what was behind the current trends. Is a Marvel movie the reason we’re seeing some brights? What’s the relationship between wearing beige and #MeToo? I investigate - and also uncover which trends have bubbled to the surface. Amazing photos by @simonschluter with styling by @_jam______ and mua @davidpwaterman_makeup @arnsdorf // shout outs to those who helped or who are mentioned: @eugeniekelly @kelliehush @vanbadham @karen.webster.aus @nbdeihl @mrrichardnylon @_aje_ @_meganpark @_aje_ @melly_singer @yahav_paris99 @oncewas__ @rebeccavallance @theway @leemathewsau @viktoriaandwoods @bandedtogether_official @karen_millen_aus @carlazampatti and others who don’t have insta!

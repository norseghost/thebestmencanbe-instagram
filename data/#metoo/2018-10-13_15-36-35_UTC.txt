I worked to the wee hours of the night and I am back and up and at it. Itâ€™s been a journey for me to say the least learning to not only find my voice but to speak it. Slowly I am becoming more and more confident with sharing with the world who I am. Embracing vulnerability with you all in hopes that it can help heal or inspire others. Just because you do not know my story yet does not mean it ceased to happen and Encourage  you all to look at each individual and wonder what their story is. We are all shaped from the world around us and no two worlds are alike, remember that when you lack empathy and compassion for an individual who is suffering.

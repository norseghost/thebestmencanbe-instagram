Since 1993, @WomenforWomen International has helped more than 478,000 marginalized women in countries affected by war and conflict. They serve women in 8 countries offering support, tools, and access to life-changing skills to move from crisis and poverty to stability and economic self-sufficiency.

They believe strong women build strong nations, we do too! 
We do this initiative in partnership with The Happy Few Ladies Networking Club who has been actively raising funds to this organization for many years.

Do you support a charity or a mission that empowers women? Let us know we would be happy to give a hand. ðŸ¥°

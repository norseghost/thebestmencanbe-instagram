Love this little mindmap on how out of control we can get with our thoughts. There is so much we can control but that’s really only with ourselves and what’s going on inside our head. *

I’ve had the fortune (yes, fortune because of the woman I’ve become) of having a lot of narcissistic people in my life so I’ve built quite the defence mechanism to them, but not without all the pain of dealing with someone trying to seriously dismantle my life. Who gets used to that? I’ve just gotten better at dealing with it. *

This is what I do in a crisis (and I just finished court (for now - he seems to be making a sport out of this)...so this is what I do: *
*
👉🏼I take a handful of deep breaths *
*
👉🏼I ask myself what is in my head and what is fact *
*
👉🏼I ask myself what part of this I can control, and then I take action *
*
👉🏼 I take more deep breaths, and then realize I should meditate, so I do that no matter where I am, and I don’t care if I look funny to anyone around me (I just laugh and say I’m going through a divorce and everyone laughs along 😳🙄)*
*
👉🏼I ask myself three things: what is my language (and I turn a negative into a positive quickly), I check my body and move into a power position (no slouching and no head down), and I bring my focus back to my work and help women who need me.*

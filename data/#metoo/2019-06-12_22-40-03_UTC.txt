Posted @withrepost • @abcofanxiety Having severe anxiety is like being held at gunpoint anywhere and at any moment. Would you expect someone held at gunpoint to make rational choices? To enjoy a night out? To be able to eat, drink or execute any kind of basic gesture? You shouldn’t expect more from someone who’s dealing with that kind of pressure on a daily basis, you shouldn’t add pressure to the existing one. If you have a loved one who’s dealing with severe anxiety, keep in mind that sometimes their actions and their words are made under extreme fear, maybe irrational for you but extremely real for them. -

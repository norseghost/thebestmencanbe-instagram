A new day is on the horizon ðŸŒ…
Finally got around to catching up on the Golden Globes and I have to say that Oprahâ€™s powerful speech left me with chills. This is so much more than a moment in history, itâ€™s a movement that has taken generations of magnificent women and phenomenal men to grow. Thank you to the women who have found the strength to march forward through all sorts of unimaginable adversity, to the men who have listened to their struggles, and to every person who is choosing speak up in support of this movement. I stand with women across every industry, race, and religion to say #TIMESUP on silence, waiting, and tolerating. Times up on abuse, harassment, marginalization, and underrepresentation. Now is the time for us to stand up for equality, safety, and inclusion on all fronts. So inspired by the strong display of solidarity for this movement at the golden globes. May our dedication to uncovering the truth and the courage to share our stories bring us forward into a new era where nobody has to say the words #metoo

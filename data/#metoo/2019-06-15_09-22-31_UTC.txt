What theartherapist did today:
(trigger alert) I was contemplating on the sign of the Virgo, and for some reasons I thought of her as a forest nymph who is also the Guardian of Mother Nature, as Virgo is an earth sign. She does not join the maddening crowd and will never be the life of the party, but she is one who quietly stands firm and stays true to her values. 
Somehow as I was sketching her, I was reminded of the alluring female sexuality as symbolised by our virginity, (but of course, it’s the sign of the virgin) and the temptations girls had to suffer as we grow up. One of the most commonly faced pressures is the male attempt to have power and control over our female sexuality by using this seemingly irrefutable argument, “If you truly love me, you would give in to me/my request/demand for sex.” Some girls would give in, without giving it much thought, as they truly believed that they are born to please who they love, or they have been conditioned by society to please people in general, and they do not have the courage or state of mind to say no to sexual requests or forced gratification.

But what would be a girl or a women who truly are grounded in her values say, when faced with this twisted logic? I asked the eternal virgin for an answer, and she said, “Tell him, if you really love me, you would wait for me and not pressure me to do anything against my will.” We should all be able to say yes, or no, without fear or favour.

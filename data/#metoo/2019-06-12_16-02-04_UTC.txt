⁣🌈 This is my letter to you 💫⠀
⠀
I hope everything is well and you're soaring above the clouds. ⠀
⠀
This is my letter to you, to also keep you grounded and know where you came from. ⠀
⠀
Being an entrepreneur has been one of the best decisions you've ever made, but I know that it can also lead you towards questionable paths. ⠀
⠀
I want you to remember this. ⠀
⠀
🌱You survived an abusive relationship that almost ended your life.⠀
🌱 You used to be a waitress that worked 11 hours a day being paid $3 an hour. ⠀
🌱 You hated your body.⠀
🌱 You continuously fight depression and anxiety every day.⠀
🌱You are growing so incredibly fast, and you're doing well.⠀
🌱 Remember the people who graciously helped you without asking for anything in return. ⠀
⠀
I want you to remember this. ⠀
⠀
When you're feeling down. ⠀
When you feel like you're not enough.⠀
When you feel like a fraud. ⠀
When people talk behind your back. ⠀
When the money hits your bank account. ⠀
When you work with a new client. ⠀
When someone asks you for business advice. ⠀
⠀
Remember why you started in the first place. ⠀
⠀
🌻 To help your family.⠀
🌻 To give yourself time to heal. ⠀
🌻 To live a life of comfort. ⠀
🌻 To have a roof over your head and food to eat.⠀
🌻 To change other peoples lives for the better.⠀
🌻 To help other survivors. #MeToo ⠀
⠀
There's nothing wrong being selfish with your time and energy. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with being materialistic (You get to treat yourself too!). ⠀
⠀
You work hard for this every single day, and before you know it, you're about to hit your 7 figure mark. ⠀
⠀
Note: My business is growing incredibly fast. It's so easy to look down on people (and unfortunately, to be real with all of you, I catch myself doing that.) 🚨 ⠀
⠀
Having a major ego boost can sometimes lead to messy paths that I don't want to fall into. ⠀
⠀
I am writing this so that I can look back at it, year(s) from now and to be continuously reminded of my WHYs. I strive everyday to come from a place of understanding, patience, and integrity.⠀
⠀
I want that girl crying in her hospital bed to realize how far she has come. ⠀
⠀
What are your WHYs? I want to read yours too! ⠀
⠀

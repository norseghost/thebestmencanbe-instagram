Graduation is so much more than getting a degree. For me personally, completing this degree was about the chance to speak against injustice and raise the voices of people who have been unheard.
✧
I wrote my thesis on young women’s experiences of sexual violence in public spaces of Mumbai, and I can surely say this writing process changed my life. Reflecting the global struggle that women face when it comes to having freedom, equality and the sense of comfort and safety in their daily lives, I was able to position my own experiences on a larger continuum. The fight against gendered violence is not meant to be fought alone.
✧
The stories of my study’s participants revealed a powerful struggle for happiness and the desire for equal existence and opportunities. More than that, I came to know of the courage of these young women, and their unwillingness to give up even after having faced some of the most traumatic experiences.
✧
I want to dedicate my master’s to all the brave women who do not accept to be called a victim, who choose to survive and thrive and who know that there is more to life even if the society around you tells you it’s over. May we empower each other to see the beauty of life and to be steadfast in protecting our integrity and rights ❤️

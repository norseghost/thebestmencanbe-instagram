I, for one, have spent way to much time in my life saying harmful things about others, judging others, thinking badly of others, mistreating others, and worst of all just hating other people.

TBH, I didn't know any different.  It was what I grew up with. It was all I knew. I was so filled with unworthiness that I had no love to give. 
The reality is that when you don't love yourself you don't even know it.  You don't know that you're treating yourself badly.  You don't realize that you're treating others badly. 
Here's a clue. Anytime you're looking at someone else's actions and not being understanding of them. It's a red flag that you don't truly love yourself!

Keep your eyes to yourself.  Keep your opinions for yourself.  Get rid of your judgments completely.  Never hurt someone else with your words, actions, attitude, or even thoughts.

Then you will find your One real and true love!

Yourself. 
That's when you will stop hurting others.  Only then will you see how you are truly affecting them.

                        "text": "Featured Veteran: Personnelman Seaman Lisa Spencer of the United States Navy, July 1989 \u2013 July 1993.\n\nIn light of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s year-long legal battle stemming from accusations of sexual assault, Lisa Spencer wanted to chime in with her personal opinions and experience on the matter.\n\nThe media has been focused on former film mogul Harvey Weinstein. Not too long ago other celebrities like Bill Cosby, Michael Jackson, and R. Kelly held the limelight. Spencer believes many fail to mention that Cardi B has also been accused of committing sexual assaults. Spencer believes that despite all of her accolades and acclaim, Cardi B needs to be held to the same standard as her male counterparts. \u201cWe, as a society, currently show too much favoritism by picking and choosing who we hold accountable.\u201d She has seen the movie industry start to clean house, and next she wants the music industry and society to follow suit across the board, especially in the military.\n\nBased on anonymous surveys taken by active-duty service members in fiscal year 2018, Military Sexual Trauma (MST) has been on the rise with a majority of incidents not being reported. This is a surprising fact given the recent rise of the #MeToo movement and the amount of pressure top military officials have received to make changes. Spencer feels that MST in this day and age needs to stop because \u201cenough is enough.\u201d She also feels that a common misconception is that MST is only committed against female service members.

This is a subject she knows all too well.\n\nAfter being in the Navy for a few months, Spencer was sexually assaulted by a fellow service member. Not knowing what to do after the incident, she credits her division petty officer with ordering her to speak to the local Judge Advocate General\u2019s Office. Her accuser\u2019s trial was set within a few months, ... https://www.devildogusainc.org/metoo-and-weinstein-a-veterans-thoughts/"

Part Two of the consent series, this time with first aid. They really like to trap men (primarily men with "white privilege") into corners in today's day and age, and this is no different. With the #metoo movement, you can get sued for either barely touching boobs in a professional and acceptable way to save someone's life or you get sued for letting them die. It's EXTREMEMLY UNFAIR! Seriously, they say that minorities are always the targeted group, but really it's all the conservative white males... God forbid I'm born white and happen to be INFORMED (GASP)!!!

Tomorrow afternoon! It’s not too late to get your tickets. I’m really looking forward to supporting on the 1s + 2s and I appreciate @timeofbutterflies for creating space for healing and awareness on domestic violence and sexual abuse. 💜

#repost • @timeofbutterflies Do not miss this!! Support the cause even if you cannot make it, you can donate a ticket or make a generous donation for future workshops/events.

This is important to me because as a survivor of both sexual abuse & domestic violence there is nothing more fulfilling to me them supporting others in this journey! 🙏🏽❤️.

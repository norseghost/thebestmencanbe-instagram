#throwbackthursday | ‚úùÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Nervous and flailing about, but singing deeply from my heart... In today's blindly partisan political climate with American gun violence/mass incarceration at an all time high and global warming presently reaching its tipping point, George Michael's ‚ÄúPraying For Time‚Äù may be more prevalent now than it was in the summer of 1990 when it was first released: ‚ÄúThis is the year of the hungry man 
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late
Well, maybe we should all be praying for time‚Äù

Now, what are we going to do about it? CGUNüßø

Had a good day Sunday. Regardless of somewhat different playstyles, we still have each other's backs. Happy memorial day to all, and remember that we aren't here for free, but live in freedom because of the cost it took. Everything has a price. 
The words I live by, and you should too: ðŸ‘‡ "Greater love has no one than this: to lay down oneâ€™s life for oneâ€™s friends." ~{John 15:13}

And yes, I play shirtless. Also yes, there are BBs, 90+ farenheight weather, and mosquitos. Yes, I do play hard and do not go home lmaoooo

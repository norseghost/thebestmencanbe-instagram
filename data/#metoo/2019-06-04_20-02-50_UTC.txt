IT’S TIME, for the 49th installment of #TBKoW. Boy I tell yah, the Zhaddy’s are sick. The #GoodBrothers kick things off with the weekend fights from Boxing, MMA and Rasslin. From “Canelo” Álvarez getting paper, to Katie Taylor and Delfine Persoon trying to kill eachother, to the “Mexican Rocky” Andy Ruiz Jr shocking the world w/ his TKO of Heavyweight Champ “AJ” Anthony Joshua. Also, we discuss DAZN's blatant disrespect for Andy Ruiz Jr., Uncle Boobah’s distaste for Eddie Hearn and Combate Americas Maria Paula Buzaglo. We close out the segment w/ the #GoodBrothers discussing the wage discrepancy b/w Boxers and MMA Fighters, the style evolution in the UFC and the newly formed rasslin promotion #AEW, their 1st PPV, their TV deal with TNT and their place in the landscape of sports entertainment (looking a lot like Monday Night Nitro). Shout out Mean Gene Okerlund.

We then catch up on the week discussing what led to us being so sick. Uncle Ole berated Uncle Boobah for not being able to keep the alligators down (#SteakAndWeights). We revisit Uncle Ole’s recent work trip to Europe and some of the cars he encountered. Finally we discussed Uncle Ole’s upcoming work trip to Russia, how one gets there, and what they eat.

Finally we close out the episode with #CurrentEvents. From Bret Favre’s investment in a Pharma Company developing a drug to combat brain inflammation, to human traffic jams on Mt. Everest resulting in deaths, to the UK Prime Minister resigning due to her inability to achieve a Brexit deal, to Moby creeping on Natalie Portman, to Illinois's new #Abortion Law, and Obama spreading US gun law misinformation.

Oh and how could the bbbbboyz forget #AOC. We send a rare shout out to Meryl Streep. And finally we bring back Life Advice w/ the Good Brothers.

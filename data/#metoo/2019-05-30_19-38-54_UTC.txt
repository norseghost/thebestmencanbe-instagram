Yes--You read that right.  I just got back from the Las Vegas jail with our team from Hookers For Jesus for our weekly Ladies Of Destiny class we teach in the detention center. .

Many of the ladies sign up for our class because they are looking for solutions to their lives being out of control. Many have been arrested for prostitution related charges--and some have done other crimes stemming from prostitution.  We all know that most of this is actually related to sex trafficking, and the abuse that has been perpetrated upon them. .

Once we start sharing about sex trafficking--the causes, the symptoms, and signs of being trafficked, major lightbulbs go off in each ladie's minds, and we see their eyes light up.  They are discovering that they were victimized!
.
After the ladies prayer requests, we all sang a song together by Lauren Daigle, called "You Say." It is powerful! Read these lyrics: . "I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know .

You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, oh You say that I am Yours
And I believe (I), oh I believe (I)
What You say of me (I)
I believe
.

The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity" .

As I was singing with the ladies today, (and very loud--LOL) I was closing my eyes. And I heard several ladies crying, and one lady in particular completely lost it, and started sobbing almost uncontrollably. It was heart wrenching.

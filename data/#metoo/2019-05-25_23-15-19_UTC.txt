End of year #exhibition @cassfoundation 
__________________________________________________________
I would like to thank each and every one of you for your time, support, encouragements and for making this day so special!

The end of a year is a good time to look back, reflecting on achievements, and to look forward, to see what we still need to accomplish.
•
To my dear colleagues and tutors: I count myself lucky and I’m glad I’ve met such amazing, inspirational and talented people. Thanks for being some of the most interesting people I've ever worked with. You all are the best!❤️

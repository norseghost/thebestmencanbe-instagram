#NoaPothoven a 17 year old Dutch girl died because she couldn't fight her depression and PTSD anymore. She underwent medical treatments, ECT and what not to recover from the trauma of being abused until this one day when she couldn't take it anymore and decided to starve herself to death. Her family and doctors saw her suffer for years and decided to not force feed her. She didn't eat and drink for days and then passed away. 
Noa was failed by everyone around her. She reached out to seek help repeatedly but nothing could save her. She also wrote a book on her challenges and wrote in her blog 'I don't want to just give up'. This raises a lot of questions on our society, mental health services and the work that mental health professionals are doing.

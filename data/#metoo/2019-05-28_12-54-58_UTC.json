                        "text": "The way Obsessed was turned into a reductive portrait of a fading diva who should never have gone up against one of the world\u2019s \u201cgreatest rappers\u201d is emblematic of the challenges we\u2019re still grappling with when it comes to taking women's experiences seriously. Particularly for Mariah, her \u2018diva\u2019 moniker means she rarely gets the credit she deserves for her artistry. This is despite having either written or co-written 17 of her 18 US number 1 singles -- more than any other singer in history. In an interview with V Magazine, she acknowledged this, saying: \u201cA lot of people see\u2026 this diva; they see hair, make-up, body and clothes\u2026 they don\u2019t think songwriter. But I look at myself as a songwriter first, and then a singer.\u201d\nWhen asked about #MeToo last year, Mariah revealed how she coped with situations of controlling men \u201cby turning a negative into a positive\u201d. Which is what she did with Obsessed \u2013 she turned one man\u2019s ongoing harassment campaign into a top-10 hit. But she also, purposefully or not, captured the way our misogynistic society tries to vilify and discredit women who speak out.\nTen years on, Mariah\u2019s still dispatching those unworthy of her company with her trademark wit on songs like GTFO. Meanwhile, Eminem\u2019s recent music and behaviour, including a lyrical takedown of Trump supporters and apologising for using a homophobic slur against Tyler, The Creator suggests he is willing to adapt to today\u2019s changing culture. But that doesn\u2019t mean change is also coming to the wider music industry. Men remain the dominant gatekeepers in the industry. Whether that\u2019s as label executives, managers, radio DJs, critics, journalists and even musicians themselves, men are still very much in control and can exercise their power and influence to shape (or hurt) a woman\u2019s career. The industry\u2019s complacency in responding to cases of male violence is symptomatic of just how institutionalised misogyny is within the music industry. It\u2019s everywhere and not nearly enough of us are challenging it. Mariah Carey, and all women, deserve better. i-D MAGAZINE 2019 #mariahcarey#god#family#day#jesuschrist#metoo"

Still immensely proud of my books and how they put a strong woman as the main character, because thatâ€™s what women are in real life, as well as fiction: damn strong ðŸ’ª. And the more books, film, TV and the arts reflect this truth, the better the world we live in will eventually be . . .  #women #strongwomen #metoo #makechange #heforshe #writersofinstagram #amwriting #reesewitherspoonbookclub #bestseller #femalewriters #aspergers

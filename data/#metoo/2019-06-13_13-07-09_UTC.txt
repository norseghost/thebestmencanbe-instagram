Sometimes trauma can make it more difficult to access vital services like smear tests so you are amazing for getting the healthcare you need or even taking the first step to finding out more information ðŸ’•
In the U.K. (specifically London and Glasgow) there is the fab @mybodybackproject which helps any one who has a cervix who has experienced sexual violence (they are trans and non-binary friendly) to access services like smear tests. It also runs a pregnancy clinic and holds monthly workshops that are safe spaces in which to discuss sexuality. ðŸŒ¸
DM us or comment if thereâ€™s anything like this where you are so we can compile a list of trauma-aware services ðŸ’Œ! -

                        "text": "There was fire \ud83d\udd25 in the sky tonight. .\nToday marks the first day that I have been completely free of big pharma in over 15 years. I am still suffering a psych drug brain injury from the benzodiazepine, Valium, 188 days after discontinuation, but I am continuing to push through each day and slowly regaining my strength. I have survived the withdrawal of Opiates, Benzos, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, stimulants, Nicotine, muscle relaxers, diet pills and about 7 others. Big Pharma had a HUGE hold over me and and I was in prison to it for much of my life. The antidepressant was the final drug that I came off of, as I want my body to be in its most natural state as I continue healing from the brain/neurological injury caused by the benzo. I am not anti medication, I just want to try healing from all of the damage that the drugs did to me without other drugs and bring my body back to a place of being able to overcome trauma naturally. I don\u2019t want to be in prison with needing pills anymore. I already stopped breathing and died once, now I would like to live. I know that this healing journey both from childhood trauma as well as psych drug injury is not over, but I am going to keep pushing forward, as I have survived some very hard stuff. Sending many healing thoughts to anyone else out there who may be going through anything similar. You\u2019re not alone. \ud83d\udc99\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#benzorecovery #fireinthesky #benzowarrior #healing #traumasurvivor #ptsd #cptsd #benzowithdrawal #recovery #onedayatatime #ptsd #cptsd #survivor #fuckbigpharma #bigpharmafree #drugfree #braintrauma #braininjury #iatrogenicinjury #endlongtermbenzouse #endopiateaddiction #endthestigma #metoo #eatingdisorderrecovery #endometriosis #mentalhealthawareness #notalone"

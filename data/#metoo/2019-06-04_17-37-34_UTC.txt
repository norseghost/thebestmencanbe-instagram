Time to reorganise my thoughts,  my heart, my life. When you fall in love, you are often ready to accept little fails.  But sometimes your new partner thinks it's an invitation to start pushing the limits or taking for granted your good will. Don't let them bring you to the point where you forget about your values.  When respect and real  exchange start missing it's time to leave. You deserve that somebody cares as much for you as you care for them. Not because you're narcissistic but because that's how a relationship at eye level should be.

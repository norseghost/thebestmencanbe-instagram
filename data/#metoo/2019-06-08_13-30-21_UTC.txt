Hi lovely humans, it's Sandra here @sandrafrancophoto posting for #weekendwarriors month's theme of 'bold'⠀
I believe that, in order to find our inner strength and self-confidence, feeling supported is crucial. It is important to surround yourself with people who believe in you when you doubt your own potential, those who would challenge you, but will also celebrate your smallest achievements.⠀
In 2018 the Spanish RAE (Royal Spanish Academy of Language) introduced the word 'sororidad' ('sisterhood' in English) among the new terms in their dictionary. ⠀
Defined as 'agrupación que se forma por la amistad y reciprocidad entre mujeres que comparten el mismo ideal [...]' which could be translated as 'the sisterhood and solidarity of women who stand up for one another', the term became more popular in the midst of numerous demonstrations claiming for Women's rights, such as safe abortion laws in Latinoamerica, or regarding sexual abuse and gang rape cases in Spain, coincident with the #metoo movement. ⠀
Female solidarity regained visibility as a result of all these collective voices talking and listening to each other. Shaping an organic network of human connections, from the personal (through friendships and healthy relationships) to the collective, knowing that women around us have our backs, and we have theirs, that is empowering.⠀

This week, I am thrilled to share a guest blog (the first of two parts) from my daughter, Hunter Paul.

Hunter and her husband Josh just gave me my first grandbaby, Grayson Huxley Paul. Grayson was born in April of this year, and we are having an absolute blast with him. I LOVE being a grandma, and just about every time I hold my grandson, my heart explodes with joy and I just want him to experience the best in life…including his health!

Many of you have asked me over time about health and pregnancy, so I thought it would be fun and maybe even helpful to hear Hunter’s journey. For all of us (Hunter included) it’s a work in progress, but her experience and transparency I think will encourage you!

Enjoy,
Andrea

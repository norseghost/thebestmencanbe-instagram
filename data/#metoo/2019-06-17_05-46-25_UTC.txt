Listen, I used to be just like this "agree to disagree". We can "agree to disagree" about which marvel hero is the best but we cannot agree to disagree on whether my very existence should be tolerated. I had a friend who supported Trump and would constantly bash black lives matter, we cannot agree to disagree because that's not something that is just in the news,  that's something that affects me everyday of my life. This is what feminist say when we mean intersectional.  Do not gratify those who support injustices because they don't mind your injustice. .

I was raped the night going into my 23rd birthday. 5 years later I was able to tell my story from a place of strength. God used what was meant to destroy me to draw me closer to Him and help heal many.

This Sunday I shared my story during my first sermon. To see the freedom that people got from hearing how God changed my life.

God taught me so much during that journey, and I was grateful to be able to share it with my church @weareclchammond.

No matter how much trauma you’ve experienced, no matter what shame or guilt you’ve felt afterwards, God can heal you. I am a testament of that, and I know that God has so much more in store for you.

ğŸŒŠğŸŒŠ Untreated mental health can expose itself in so many physical symptoms.  This weekend has made me realise how much work I have got to heal. But realising it takes time is the first step. So it's time to slow down and take everything as it comes, admitting I need help and getting the different help I need. ğŸ§¡ğŸ§¡ #WordsHavePower #ptsd #metoo #selfcare #selflove #speakout #itsoknottobeok happiness #bpd #strength #strengthinnumbers #help #getthehelpyouneed #dragonfly #dragonflydiaries

Something to make you smile for Monday.  Do you remember the Boggart in Harry Potter ? 
How the boggart formed the shape of what you feared most?Prof Snape became the transvestite in grandmothers clothes for Neville? Remember the music they played when the wizard students all lined up to have a go at facing what they feared the most and visualising something funny instead? Pick an ugly feral Pigeon, hear the sound these pigeons make, the movement, their smell and that stunned mullet look in their eyes. Now visualise your bully in the body of that Pigeon.  Enjoy tomorrow because everything that comes out of their mouth will be PigeonðŸ•ŠðŸ˜Š

Today was a rough day for me as was last night. I had one of those nights where all the stress got to me and I debated if my life was worth it. I opened up about it for the first time with my parents and was surprised by the support and love I got.  Everyday on recovery is a journey and although itâ€™s rough I would never wanna go back to being with my abuser #realrecovery #metoo #mentalhealthawareness #ptsd #depression #ptsdawareness #ptsdrecovery #ptsdsurvivor #anxiety #anxietysupport #mentalhealth #mentalillness #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare #selflove #trauma #traumarecovery #believesurvivors #notalone #support #suicideprevention #metoo #healing #healingvibes

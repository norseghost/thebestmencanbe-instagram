I did a very brave thing yesterday. After 15 years, I finally found the courage to tell my mother about my molester. I wish I had told her sooner, but well, sometimes we don't do what we should have done earlier until something way worse happens. Sometimes we learn a little too late. Sometimes we take too long to understand. And sometimes, that is enough.

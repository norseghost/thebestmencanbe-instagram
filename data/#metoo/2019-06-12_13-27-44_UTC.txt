We’re bringing our Hypotheticals- A moral dilemma
to @changesfestival 
ART vs. ARTISTS 
Separation of art and artist has long allowed popular creative work to be enjoyed in isolation from personal transgressions of their creators. However, greater collective focus on accountability and social justice following the #metoo movement has led to greater scrutiny of creators. In ‘Hypotheticals: Art vs. artists’, themes of cancel culture, censorship, restorative justice, forgiveness and remorse will be explored as a group, as participants are led through a hypothetical moral dilemma by host @Sose fuamoli and moderator Dr Catherine Strong, applying ethics to come to their own solutions. 
This Hypotheticals session at Changes has been prepared by advisors Dr Emma Rush, a philosopher who teaches ethics for creative industries at Charles Sturt University and Dr Catherine Strong, program manager of RMIT University’s music industry program, who will also moderate the session, alongside creative producers Helen Marcou AM and Jessie French. ‘Hypotheticals: Art vs. artists’ is proudly supported by @rmituniversity and 
Bakehouse Ideas.

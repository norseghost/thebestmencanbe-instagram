I’ve been debating about whether or not to talk about this on this page, but it feels right today. 
TW/ Sexual Assault: The reason I’m so open about sexual health & wellness, particularly for women, is because I myself am a sexual assault survivor. I feel I owe it to you all to be transparent on this page because statistically 1 out of the 6 women reading this post has experienced or will unfortunately experience this in their lifetime as well. For awhile, I was unable to talk or even think about the subject because, well, it was extremely triggering. For too long, too many of us have had our view of sex destroyed by someone else. Everyone deals with trauma in their own way & for me, helping women explore, love, and own their sexuality has become a big part of who I am. You are never alone & as cliche as it sounds, it gets better. Let’s keep the conversation going & break the stigma together. 
That being said, this is Awaken from @foriawellness / @foriapleasure! “It’s like the cinnamon challenge for your vagina... but like... in a really really good way” You can get your own on @thebloomi with a discount if you use code ‘JASMINE10’

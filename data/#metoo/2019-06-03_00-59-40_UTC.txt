Shame is a behemoth of a machine. It is greedy, dangerous, outdated, and an energy hog. It’s noise drowns out all other voices. It’s smoke is toxic.

My shame machine has grown exponentially since I was a little girl. I have tried my entire life to shut it down, but it has grown “too big to fail”. Finally, I have found something that works. I am learning how to cut off its fuel supply. I am dismantling this monster one piece at a time. It is not an easy process. I often burn my hands and I have yet to go for long without being reminded of its presence when it’s hellish heat causes a constant sweaty trickle down my back.

I am David—confronting this Goliath who dregs up my past and roars belligerently whenever my own voice is strong and steady. I shut the engine room door muffling it’s noise while cutting off its oxygen.

Now I am the one growing exponentially.

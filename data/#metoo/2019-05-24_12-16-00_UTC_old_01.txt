Damaris Athene is another presenter at our upcoming playdate! @damarisathene.artist is a studio artist as part of @circuitcambs @wysing.arts.centre

Damaris Athene explores corporeality and the human form, focusing on painting and starting to include digital print and sculpture. ‘Cheer Up Love’ is a departure into figuration, reflecting an urgent desire to speak about the portrayal of female bodies, spurred on by research on abjection, reading feminist texts and watching #metoo unfold.

Allow me to re-introduce myself! My name is Holly, and I am passionate about helping people achieve their goals and live happy, healthy, fulfilling lives. I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist trained in sex therapy and EMDR (trauma therapy), a PhD student in Human Sexuality, and a sex toy aficionado! I specialize in treating sexual trauma and helping clients get back to a pleasurable experience of sex and their bodies. Thanks so much for following, and please reach out! Looking forward to being more active and engaging with you guys! ðŸ’•

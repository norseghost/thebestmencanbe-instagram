💔 “Isn’t it time you were over it?”
💔 “You only knew him for six months. Why are you so upset?”
💔 “She lost her daughter, husband, and job all in one year. You should be more grateful.”
.
The world knows how to measure for time, analyzing how long you knew someone, how long they’ve been gone, and how long you’ve been grieving. 🕰
.
What the world fails to account for is INTENSITY—the stuff of relationships: emotions, secrets, inside jokes, mutual trust, and love.
.
There is no measurement for that. 🙅🏼‍♀️ You can grieve someone you knew for three months more than you can grieve someone you’ve known your whole life. You don’t have to be “over” grief just because time has passed. The length of time you knew someone is not proportionate to your pain. 💕 More on Episode 81 of Coming Back. Listen in!

Not long ago I was invited to be a keynote speaker before a panel discussion on how young men can be allies to young ladies. We all know the new #abortionlaws in a few states are a hot topic right now. I won't get into all the "right" or "wrong" dialogue but I will say being an ally requires having some sort of empathy and it requires being of assistance to prospective ally. I really appreciate my friend Terrence for coming to support me but contributing to the discussion. He shared a few profound statements but one was a paramount.  Loosely stated, he shared that you don't go into ally country telling them how to govern themselves but you go with the intent to assist. So, if you're seeking to be an ally to women you don't tell us how to govern ourselves or our bodies(country) but you seek to share your resources and identify how you can help with what we TELL YOU we need assistance with regarding our agency.
Let's keep that in mind as it relates to women, other races, countries, etc.
Thanks for coming to my #TedTalk, lol. #100WaysToMakeADifference #ThortonFractional #MeToo #empowerment #womenmatter #blackauthors #ArtsOfHumanity #alliances

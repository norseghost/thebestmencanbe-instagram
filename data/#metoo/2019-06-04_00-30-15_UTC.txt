“On Artists” by Ashleigh Wilson has just arrived in store and online ($15) – and is perfectly timed for the upcoming lecture Artists Behaving Badly: In conversation with Ashleigh Wilson and John Saxby held by the Art Gallery Society on Saturday 15 June at 2pm⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
-⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
There’s a long history of artists behaving badly, from Picasso and Caravaggio to Donald Friend and Miles Davis. Dennis Nona has recently made headlines, as has Chuck Close, but then there’s Kevin Spacey, Michael Jackson, VS Naipaul, Alfred Hitchcock and Ezra Pound.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
To be creative, it’s often suggested, is to be prone to eccentricity, transgression, madness, addiction and excess. But we can no longer excuse artists from the standards of conduct that apply to us all. Join Ashleigh Wilson, arts editor of The Australian and author of Brett Whiteley: Art, Life and the Other Thing (2016) and On artists (2019) and John Saxby, editor of Look magazine, as they discuss this notion and what becomes of the work that remains if we denounce the artist. Books sales and a signing will be available after the event. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

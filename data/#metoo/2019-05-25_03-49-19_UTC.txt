In what began as Indian actress Tanushree Dutta calling out veteran film actor Nana Patekar for harassing her at the sets of one of her films in 2008, India’s witnessed its #MeToo moment explode into a movement. Women took charge, and in less than a week scores of sexual harassment accounts were exposed on social media.

While India’s Child and Women Development Minister Maneka Gandhi assured harassment of any kind will not be tolerated, the #MeToo India movement exploding is just a tip of the iceberg of the years of oppression women have faced.

What happens to such exposes and social media outbursts? Unfortunately the rape trial of journalist Tarun Tejpal, which has been pending for the last five years, could be a testimony to the fate awaiting others called out.

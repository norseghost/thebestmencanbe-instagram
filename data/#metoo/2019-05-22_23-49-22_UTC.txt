Last years cover page! 
It’s been a while since I’ve posted or even written in my journal. It’s really difficult to write actually, especially when you’re not feeling 100%
Overall, May has been an emotional month for me. Late nights, stomach filled with anxiety, nightmares, and a few breakdowns. It’s been a little over two years since the rape and lately it feels like it just happened. The memories have been haunting me and I  have been experiencing more triggers... I also see the monster that did this to me almost daily in other people. A complete stranger could just have one thing that reminds me of him and it’s like my heart flat lines and life is breathed into my nightmare. .

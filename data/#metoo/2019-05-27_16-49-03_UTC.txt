‼️TRIGGER WARNING: rape, incest, sexual assault. ‼️ “I was only three the first time…I have a disability, sensory perception. I couldn’t talk until I was four because of it. It was my own father who molested me for years. The last time, I was eight. He’d…use his fingers on me, I’d bleed every time. My mother was the only one who worked, my older brother is 9 years older and my younger brother is 4 years younger. My father hated the boys, I was his angel. It didn’t go too far, not like other cases. He’d tell me that all father and daughters do it. It’s a bonding activity. I was only young, how could I know?When I was eight, he tried raping me for the first time. I’m glad I lied and said I needed to use the bathroom. I can even remember the time. 11:30 pm. My mom left him when I was seven, I only visited on weekends. That was the last weekend I went over. I’m 16 now and I finally told my mother. I haven’t seen my father in years. I’m in counseling, and I’m getting better. Step by step. I just wanna say, there’s no reason to be ashamed. No matter how you dress, what you talk about, what you do. That doesn’t give anyone permission to hurt you. You’re not to blame, they are for thinking so. That’s my story, I know it’s not much. I’m hoping this will help someone else.” - anonymous

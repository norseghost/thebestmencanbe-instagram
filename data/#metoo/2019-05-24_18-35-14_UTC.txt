I am excited to share that “Nonsuicidal Self-Injury: Advances in Research and Practice” has been published and is now available!  I remember Jason and I talking about the idea of this book many years ago.  So honored to have gotten to know and collaborate with these esteemed researchers.  I have learned so much from them and appreciate their dedication to the study of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury.  It always thrilled me that their findings were congruent to what I was seeing in the self-injury program I ran.  It truly represented to me the merging of research and clinical work.  I greatly enjoyed collaborating with Greg on our chapter, “Comprehensive Assessment of Nonsuicidal Injury” and appreciate all the work he did.  If interested, this book is available at Amazon.

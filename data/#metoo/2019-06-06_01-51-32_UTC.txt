I never thought a day like today would happen.

I spent the majority of the day sobbing, shaking, and mentally toughening up. It’s not every day you are given an emergency protective order.

I bring this up because it seems almost taboo in society to discuss this. It’s a hard process, extremely hard for the victim, and you’re constantly feeling questioned for just wanting your life and safety back. And I don’t want to be silent anymore. I want to hold 🔸S P A C E 🔸in my life, be loud and proud... large and in charge; I don’t want to shrink into nothing anymore.

I stood up for myself. I showed up for myself and took hours to prove to myself that this ongoing harassment was NOT OKAY, that I wasn’t asking for it, and that it had to stop for my safety and well being.

For every woman out there feeling like her gut is wrong, she’s too “emotional” or “overly sensitive”, I look at you and say ‼️FUCK THAT‼️ and fuck them for making you feel that way. Stand up for yourself and trust yourself. I trust you. I believe you.

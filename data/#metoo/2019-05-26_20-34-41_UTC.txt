Words cannot describe the experience I had in Africa. Landing in a place I already had pre existing thoughts quickly changed my perception. The landscape was everything I did imagine but the people were not. They were inspirational, soulful, innovative and determined. In one week I saw villages that were below the poverty line. Sitting down with people that looked vacant and confused. I felt the heartache of seeing starving children. They had a sense of helplessness but you could see the fire in their eyes of hope. And by the end of the trip, I visited a self reliant village that accomplished their initial vision of food production, education, women empowerment and micro finance. At phase 5, The kiboga community have made future action plans and commitments to save enough money to have better electricity which will help with security of their bank, sufficient running of the milling machine and running of the storage bank that will help grow their community with future farmers. 
Seeing the vision action plans of the people and communities and how they have changed their mindset to see what’s possible with the limited resources they have and the challenges and roadblocks they go through has truely changed my life. After every day I wrote a journal reflecting on what I saw, how I felt and the stories I listened too. Everyday brought me sadness and at the same time enlightenment. 
I’d like to thank everyone who supported me on this journey. You have really made a difference to me and the communities in Uganda. 
One sentence that reflects my experience - People see what you don’t see in yourself.  #metoo #thehungerprojectaustralia #decjuba

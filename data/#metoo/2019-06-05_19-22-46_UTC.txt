This is a post by ‘healing-positivity’, saying: “Things will get better, You’ll get better. There’s no where else to go but up from rock bottom. So don’t give up, fight, stay strong and keep going no matter how rough it gets. I’m here to support You. You can do this. Get through today, then tomorrow, the week, the month, the year. Focus on yourself and your well being. Surround yourself with positivity. Tell yourself it will get better. Because it truly does.”

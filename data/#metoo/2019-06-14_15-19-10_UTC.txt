So I took a day off today. I told my boss earlier this week that I still wasn't well. She didn't ask me to prove myself. She didn't ask for my symptoms. She is my boss: not my mother. .

"If you're sick, you're sick, go rest." If you are in a workplace that doesn't do that, either you are on the hook to change the culture by giving them less information and standing up for your right for autonomy and privacy in your health, or you quit, and find a place with a compassionate and evolved boss. .
.
You deserve it. 
This is a human right. 
You are allowed to take a day off and not fight for it. You are allowed.

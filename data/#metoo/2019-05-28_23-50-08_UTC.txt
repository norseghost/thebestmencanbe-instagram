🌱 “What causes our boundaries to be violated is also that we are actively trained not to defend our boundaries, to push past what we think we want and need to accommodate other people. We’re told all these scripts about what we should want, what we should be willing to do and that really allows for us to be pushed over in a way that perpetuates rape culture.” - @stas.phoenix

too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, and honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.
Leo buscaglia
Nobody tries to destroy themselves on purpose. They're trying to destroy something inside of them that just doesn't belong. 
everyday we should try to be the type of person that no matter where you go or where you are, you always add value to the lives of those around you
no matter how happy someone may seem, they have moments when they question if they can go on. No matter how confident someone may look, there are times when they feel unsure and insecure. And no matter how strong someone may appear, they have days when they feel like they're falling apart. Never think for a moment you're alone with your struggles. You're not a mess. You're human - Lori Deschene

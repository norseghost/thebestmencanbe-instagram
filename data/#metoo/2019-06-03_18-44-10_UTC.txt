I just don't know how to describe what I am feeling today!

Day 1 of my college, you and your sister taking not only mine but my entire Family's case, your love lessons, booking a cab for me from Kolkata, Goa, Face floor scenes (LOL), Clockwise Rotation (Pyaar galat cheez hai xD), Second Year ka birthday (special mention ðŸ˜›), Tera baar baar scooter se girna (Thank God, Standards nai gire xP), Your love for Gym and Food as well and so many things. Yes, I'll sleep peacefully now, but I'll miss you ruining it more! You were the reason for the Change in my Life! From first day to the last, you were always there for me! The only constant! Thanks for always having my Back! You are not just a best friend but more like a brother from another mother! I'll miss you man! I'll fuckin miss you! ðŸ˜¢ðŸ’” As promised, Yes, You're a LEGEND to me! @mayankk_daga ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜˜ You know you earned it! ðŸ˜‚ 
Stay safe bro! Kolkata will obviously be a bitch to you! XD To a New Beginning! Until Next Time! Love You 3000!

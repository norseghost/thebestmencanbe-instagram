Selfish choices are about indulging our own needs. Period. I want this, or I want that. Whereas self-care behavior is intentional and helps the self, selfish behavior can harm others. A surefire way to know when you are being selfish or not is to ask yourself this one question: “Will my behavior hurt someone else?” If the answer is no, let the guilt go. But if the answer is yes, perhaps reassess and make a change that works for both parties.

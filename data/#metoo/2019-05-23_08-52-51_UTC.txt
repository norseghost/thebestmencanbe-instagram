DAY 23- Educate for change. 
Start by teaching children that their body belongs to them and that they don't have a right to touch other people's bodies either. Building skills in asking for and giving permission, whether it's for tickling or taking a photo can model consent. The key to building respect and ending violence in or community is giving people the skills to negotiate about bodies, boundaries, and pleasure.

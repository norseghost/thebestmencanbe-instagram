Today is our 3 year anniversary! Three years ago, Nadia & Maria made the Brock Turner For Prison page... Today they run a nonprofit with a team of 40+ volunteers!!! Our Founders work 40 - 50 hrs/week to manage our platforms & staff, create calls to action, post content, run the nonprofit, and personally respond to DMs! Big change requires big investment, and we are so grateful for their commitment to ending abuse. 
Our #TeamWARRIORS staff invest at least 10 hours/week of volunteer time EACH to keep our platforms safe, answer questions, & provide support and resources to our community. None of our work would be possible without their efforts! Thank you!

We canâ€™t do this alone and we are so thankful for our WARRIORS community! Show your support by donating to our $30k in 30 Days fundraiser: donorbox.org/warriors30kin30days

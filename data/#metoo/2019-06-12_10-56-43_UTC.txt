When life gets tough (and I mean really tough) I am the type of person that closes the shutters, hides from the world, licks her wounds, crawls through the mucky ditch and only comes out when she's ready to face the world again. Because I'm in the fortunate position to be able to retreat with my "techniques toolbox".⠀
⠀
When we open up our social media we see empowerment coaches, online entrepreneurs, and influencers leading amazing lives, posting radiant pictures, and we all follow in the "let's boost ourselves up show". (#YOLO) This post is not for the bold and brazen, or the fiery and fierce. ⠀
⠀
This weekend I realized something. That I had to let go of the idea that I could post wonderful group session images or interesting success stories. I work for and with real people with real issues. Physical, emotional and/or mental problems. I have no business asking them to be photographed, because they come to me when they feel vulnerable. So I had to overcome my own fear and "me", who does not like herself on camera, now has to open up and show up (hence quirky). ⠀

My clients are young adults with #anxiety and #selfconfidence issues, women who dealt with sexual harassment and worse, men going through depression, menopausal women struggling with body issues, people of age with specific illnesses etc. We all have our own battles to fight and we have every right to do so in private, until the moment that we feel ready to share. Or not. Because we're afraid we'll be carrying a label on our foreheads for the rest of our lives. ⠀

That is why there are neutral, objective professionals out there. We accompany you when you need us in a safe environment. And release you when you think your transformative work is done. The one thing you need to know is this: you do not have to go through everything on your own. ⠀

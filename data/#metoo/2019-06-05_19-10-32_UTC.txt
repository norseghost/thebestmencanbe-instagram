I Am Here, from In Mourning and in Rage, part of Ariadne: A social art network by Suzanne Lacy and Leslie Labowitz.  The exhibit by these women is showing @sfmoma until August 4th.  It is extremely powerful in touching upon the violence towards woman that was silenced for so long.  #findyourvoice #metoo #takeyourpowerback #wewillnotbesilenced #womensempowerment #womensselfdefense #beyourownbadass #strengththroughcommunity

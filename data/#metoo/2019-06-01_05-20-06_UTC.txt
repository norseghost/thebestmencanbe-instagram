#Grace is a gift from God; it’s the help or strength given through the atonement of Jesus because of His love and mercy for us. That’s mind blowing to think about - we can overcome and heal because God has blessed us with His grace. When we struggle between anger and affirmation, between fear and forgiveness, between guilt and grace, we can trust that if we give this heartache to God, grace will win every time.

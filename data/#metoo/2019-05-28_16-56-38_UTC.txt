✨✨✨ On October 15, actress Alyssa Milano (2017) took to Twitter and posted an image that read, “Suggested by a friend: ‘If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote ‘Me too.’ as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.” With this tweet, Milano unwittingly co-opted a movement that had begun with activist Tarana Burke, who started the campaign in 2006 on MySpace as a way to promote empowerment and solidarity amongst women of color who had experienced sexual abuse. However, amplified by the Weinstein allegations and bolstered by Milano’s fame, the #MeToo movement exploded across social media platforms.
In just 24 hours, Facebook reported that there had been 12 million posts, comments, and reactions to #MeToo. After a week, the hashtag had been used over 1.7 million times on Twitter by users in 85 different countries.

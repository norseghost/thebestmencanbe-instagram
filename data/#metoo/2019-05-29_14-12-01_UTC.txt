We live in a world with mantras like, "#metoo" and "#lovewins" that are created to communicate culturally relevant issue of our day. But, you may be surpised to know that there are two other mantras that have been around for much longer which apply to cultural issues today: "Love God." and "Love others."⠀
.⠀
In a world made up of so many differences, there are only two principles that need apply and it's these two. Loving God keeps us humble and reminds us that there is always something greater than we are. And loving others reminds us that without each other we can accomplish nothing. #thingstoremember⠀

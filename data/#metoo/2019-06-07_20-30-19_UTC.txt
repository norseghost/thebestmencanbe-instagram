@heart.beat.doctor  @randdiabmd  @drjenniferlincoln @Monicacoronelmd posted today about an article published in Doximity last month (now deleted by Doximity)
⁣
I am ashamed to say I hadn’t heard of these events until now⁣
⁣
Briefly⁣
* USC cards fellow Dr Guillermo Cortes sexually assaults 3 female trainees ⁣
* Dr Meena Zareh, one of the victims, reports to USC⁣
* She gets no support and is retaliated against⁣
* ACGME investigates, takes away USC cardiology’s accreditation⁣
* Doximity publishes an ANONYMOUS op-ed (linked) which frames the other fellows as the victims & claims ACGME’s actions were too harsh. It repeatedly refers to the events as “sexual harassment” rather than “sexual assault”⁣

You want to know how I feel about this?⁣
Well, ⁣
FUCK YOU USC and FUCK YOU anonymous op-ed writer⁣
Your article and your opinion is bullshit⁣
What the fuck is wrong with you?⁣
⁣
How convenient you use the term “harassment” when you very well know it was SEXUAL ASSAULT. While the former is egregious, should never happen in itself, and is an illegal violation of civil rights, the latter is a FELONY. A program that fails to act to protect its trainees from repetitive FELONIES is NOT a program that should be allowed to have trainees. PERIOD.⁣
⁣
Every 92 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted. Only 5 out of every 1,000 perpetrators will go to prison (rainn.org). As a Gyn, I have sat and cried with many sexual assault victims - some who I saw soon after, some who told me years after, and some who never told anyone else but me. ⁣
⁣
Women such as Dr. Meena Zareh, do not want to be heroes, but they are.⁣
⁣
WE MUST BELIEVE AND PROTECT WOMEN. Why is this so fucking hard to do? And doctors who can’t do this are a special kind of asshole. I am disgusted by this op-ed, disgusted by the responses, and disgusted by USC’s failure to protect women.⁣
⁣
So I ask Mr Anonymous, which is worse: the inconvenience of finding another program (which, by the way, is being offered at the same institution) or the very real risk of being sexually assaulted by one of your colleagues??⁣

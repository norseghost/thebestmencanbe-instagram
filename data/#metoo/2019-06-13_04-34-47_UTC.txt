What you keep to yourself can create a long term kind of excruciating emotional agony that the body will eventually bear. I did this to myself. But I didn’t know there was a connection between the abuses I went through as a child and the illnesses I developed in my twenties. Back then, science wasn’t backing this up. I thought my illnesses were just physical. They weren’t. Even after I changed my diet, I was still sick. I was loads better but still searching for something to stop the nausea and abdominal pain that led to IBS, ulcers, migraines, depression, and severe leaky gut syndrome. .

Begin by telling your story to someone. Just get it out and move forward. If you’ve been in therapy for a while and you’re tired of telling your story, you don’t really have to with the work that I do. It’s a whole different approach that frees you holistically. It saved me time and time again from fibromyalgia and brain injuries from a lightning strike. Look into it. You’ve got nothing to lose and you could gain your health back. Your body remembers what you are trying to forget. You can release this pain. .

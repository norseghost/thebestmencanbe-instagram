Us, women, have been taught since we were born to behave a certain way and if you dont, then you were asking for whatever treatment you recieved. Its actually very sad but now as a grown woman and having the experiences that I've had.... i understand alittle bit why. I dont agree with it but whats more important? My opinion or the facts? You can teach your daughter proper etiquette and she can still be a victim. Men have shown to be pigs... young and old. Family or not. Not all men but MOST. What do y'all think about this? Im so curious. Especially parents of little girls. #questions #imCurious #parenting101 #mommyLife #daddyLife #female #women #ladies #meToo

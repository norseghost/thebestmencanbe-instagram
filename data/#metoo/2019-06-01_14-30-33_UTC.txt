Happy Pride Month! 🏳️‍🌈 This month, as we should all months, we celebrate and open the dialogue surrounding #LGBTQIA+. #LGBTQIA+ youth deserve to grow up #safe, #respected, and #valued. One way we can ensure that is with comprehensive, inclusive sex education in schools. Another is to create a culture where everyone, and most especially young people, are empowered and respected. To learn more, check out the link in our bio and sign the #GirlsToo Pledge. ❤️ 🧡 💛 💚 💙 💜 🖤

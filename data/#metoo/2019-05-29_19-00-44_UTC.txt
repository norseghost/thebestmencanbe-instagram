Stella Parton’s career began as early as 7 years old singing with her sisters and family in the foothills of the Smokey Mountains. One of twelve siblings including Dolly Parton, country music has been synonymous with the Parton name. Stella is best known for a series of country singles that charted during the mid- to late-1970s including three Top 20 hits with "The Danger of a Stranger", "Four Little Letters", and "Standard Lie Number One". Her biggest hit being 1975's "I Want to Hold You In My Dreams Tonight". She is also a seasoned actress, entertainer, and advocate. Her reputation as standing up for those even when it’s not that easy has been ridiculed and even been threatened. She shares stories of abuse and assault in a time of the “good ole boy(s)” of Nashville and her thoughts and experiences even in the #MeToo era. Hopeful, Stella is proud of the current time and the continued conversations of abuse in entertainment, but there are still too many with a voice that don’t speak for those that can’t. She also offers insight or the lack there of in the sex trafficking ring of East Tennessee. As her 40th studio album was released, Survivor is a look at her past and being able to look at it with strength and grace.⠀

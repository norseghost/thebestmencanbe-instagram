But I\u2019ve learned that every woman feels these emotions at some point, regardless of our zip codes or net worth. We universally share these scars.\n.\nSo why do we suffer alone? Because we\u2019re too damn ashamed to admit how we feel.\n.\nOur society is powered by the subtle trafficking of shame. You should try this plumper (read: your lips are too thin). You should go boxing with me (please fix your body). Let\u2019s go take selfies in the poppy fields (your life is uninteresting). You really should try meditating (you\u2019re too angry, too loud).\n.\nWomen are shamed into conformity: We should have ambitions, but not too many. We should say \u201cfuck\u201d less, but dress like we want to fuck, while behaving as though we don\u2019t want to fuck as much as we actually may desire. Our perspectives on child-rearing get more attention than our views on politics, science, art and literally every other subject.\n.\nAnd we\u2019ve internalized it both as individuals and as a culture. We are labeled, stereotyped and stigmatized until shame eventually becomes part of our identity. It becomes the lens through which we see the world.\n.\nShame is the feeling that there\u2019s something wrong with us, that we\u2019re not good enough. It\u2019s exhausting; it makes us nauseous and want to disappear. And we\u2019ll do anything to avoid it \u2014 shame other people, lie, post Photoshopped images of ourselves, and repel anyone who reflects our own flaws and weaknesses.\n.\nOur shame fuels our hysteria, which in turn feeds the shame we feel about losing control. We perpetuate the cycle because we\u2019re so afraid of what will happen if we break it \u2014 that something we\u2019ve been told was scarce and have worked for our entire lives will be taken away; that we will lose something we never had in the first place.\n.\nBut if we accept ourselves and others and own up to our shit, we will break the cycle and flourish. We are enough. #hysteriaseries\n.\n.\nFeatured: @mouthygoddess\nPhotographer/CreativeDir: @rachaelthompsonphoto"

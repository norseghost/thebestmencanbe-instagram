When you are standing up against your abuser it is traumatic. Your heart can be so afraid of what they will do to you. Well God wants the victims to put their trust in Him. Lean on God with all you got. He has promised He will be with you when you leave. God will fight the battle. Speak up and tell somebody. Then you must get away. Once you get away, break all ties. Donâ€™t look back. Follow where God leads you. You will survive. You will be ok. God has promised that no weapon formed against you will prosper. Believe Him. #noweapon #domesticviolenceawareness #domesticviolencesurvivor #loveyourself #lovegod #speakup #getaway #stayaway #metoo

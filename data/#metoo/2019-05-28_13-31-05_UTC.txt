A lot of people have come with their arguments on abortion, and this is the best one yet. ⠀
⠀
Is it then not out of love that some women decide on abortions? Nobody likes or even wants to have an abortion. It is only after careful consideration that some women will then decide to abort. Why are we slandering these women and sending them to prison? ⠀
⠀
THINK ABOUT IT.⠀

From a very young age I started a personal trade without even knowing it. To protect myself from the trauma I had endured I slowly built my wall around me...I call it the well of life. It literally got so tall, my tears continued to fill it, meanwhile i started drowning in my own fears. I needed to start breaking my wall down delving deep into it's core and although I still have my wall around me Its manageable at the height it is...just enough to keep me protected but low enough to allow the sun to still shine through me. Its ok not to give up your safe place as long as you leave there occasionally to live, love and learn xoxo Love and light to you all xo

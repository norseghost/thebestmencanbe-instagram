An excerpt from the Ziegler Podcast .  Tom Mesereau clearly  lays out what  is wrong with  the #metoo movement. This was In reference to the #MJ trial but the same blue print applies to #rkelly seeing as there was never a conviction in 2008 & barely any evidence in 2019 the same narrative is being span now. #media #metoo & #mobjustice.

The movement has stirred up mass #hysteria akin to the #salemwitchtrials
Or an #inquisition of men folk  Mr.Mesereau rightly states  we need to trade carefully because #Emotion & passion cannot override due process.

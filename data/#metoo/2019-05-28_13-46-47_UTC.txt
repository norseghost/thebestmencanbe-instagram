The ‘investigation’ into sexual harassment committed by BDS-SA Director, Muhammad Desai, has been completed without anyone really knowing it had begun. The survivors were not interviewed. There was no consultation on the terms of reference.
The report is the most blatant victim blaming.
‘Was Prof Kil being flirtatious with Mr Desai? Could it be that Mr Desai interpreted Prof Kil’s remarks to be inviting?’ All struggles are connected.
There are no feminist bombs. Palestine solidarity, like all movements, cannot claim to work for justice when they continue to violate women.

A favorite easy meatless meal for me to make is Crockpot Quinoa Taco's!

This is a plant based meal that tastes exactly like a normal taco would. If you are looking to eating more plant based meals here is one you can start with.

1.Rinse off one cup of quinoa and put it in the crockpot

2. Add quinoa, 2 cans of black beans, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of corn, 1 cup of vegetable or chicken stock and put the crockpot on high for 2 1/2 hours

3. Add on top of a tortilla, add any additional toppings and eat up! *different crockpots cook faster than others so be sure to make sure it doesn't over cook and turn the quinoa mushy*

And THAT IS IT! 
Such as easy meal to make and full of protein and fiber

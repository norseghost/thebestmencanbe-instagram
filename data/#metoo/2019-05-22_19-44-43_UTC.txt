My heart is breaking and I am disgusted and furious beyond words. This is unbelievable 💔What kind of dark and savage times are we living in today? Are we not supposed to evolve into better humans and become more aware and civilized with the passage of time? RIP sweet angel♥️🌹🙏 I am at a loss for words! Farishta, a 10-year-old girl, went to play outside on May 15th, 2019 and got abducted. When her family members went to lodge an FIR, incompetent police officials of Chak Shehzad, #Islamabad, tried to turn the tables by saying that the kid might have eloped with a guy. Her anguished yet helpless family members were forced to clean the floors of the police station for five days. Yesterday, on May 20th, 2019, Farishta's body was found mutilated after being brutally raped. As disgusting and filthy this system could get, her body was not sent for post-mortem even though it was demanded by her own family.

I condemn this heinous act and demand justice for #Farishta! It is just not the rapists who are responsible for this deplorable case, but the police officials of Chak Shehzad must also get fired immediately! People who keep asking us why we talk about feminism and women empowerment, how many answers shall I throw at you? 
Stop burying your heads in the sand for it is high time to stand for the right. It's time to pull patriarchy, fundamentalism, & radicalization up by their roots; once and for all.

Part 3- THIS IS ME, BUT THIS WAS ALSO ME.
I pulled the following from the MMC website- 
Many people ask the question, “Why doesn’t she just leave?”
Possible reasons:
* 	Low self-esteem
* 	Failure to recognize abuse
* 	Dependence
* “For the children”
* 	Isolated
* 	Traditional values
* 	Family or social pressure
* 	Hope
* 	Love
*  Fear

YEP. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK x10000000. 🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️ hi, hello this was me. 
Why does discussing domestic violence matter?
* 	1 in 4 women will be affected by domestic violence in her lifetime
* 	Over 7,000 domestic violence cases were reported locally last year
* 	Typically DV is reported after the 8th incident
What is Domestic Violence?
* 	Most people associate domestic violence solely with physical abuse.
Domestic violence is much more:
* 	It’s a pattern of coercive behavior
* 	Power and control in the relationship is unbalanced between the two partners
* 	Utilizes intimidation, threatening, harm, and harassment
* 	Intentionally or recklessly restricts the freedom of one of the partners

YEP. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK x10000000. 
DESPITE ALL OF THIS- my life today is filled with JOY & HOPE because I can use my VOICE to spread awareness by telling MY story.

Finding that feminine essence, that divinity, that is resting so peacefully is the key to awakening your soul. 
Sometimes we need a little help with that. I encourage each and everyone of you, if you havenâ€™t attended a #pussytrauma Cuddle Puddle yet! Put it on your list to do so. Sometimes we have to step outside our normal routines in order to find the healing we need. 
Ask me how you can attend! .

We were just sexually harassed at the grocery store. 
Yes... I said we. Those kids are barely 6 and 2.5. 
It’s 11:30am on a Monday. First the guy in the car commented on my appearance as he slow rolled by. Then he saw I had kids and said “oh, and your daughter too”. The next words were directed at my kids: “Mommy is wearing bad clothes”. What the actual fuck is this world coming to. The next time you think this stuff is exaggerated, think again.

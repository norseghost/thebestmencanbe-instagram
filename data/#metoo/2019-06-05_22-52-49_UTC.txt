I‚Äôm grateful for a day that celebrates running ‚ú® I‚Äôm sure this is the same for almost all of us, but to me, #globalrunningday means a lot more than mileage or just ‚Äúbeing a runner‚Äù. Because when I think of running, I think of:
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
‚Ä¢Running my first half marathon at age 20, after becoming a part of #metoo, failing out of nursing school, and having to move back home broken and destroyed. And I was different after that race.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
‚Ä¢Running my first full marathon at 27, when I was 8 months postpartum with our third child, in a broken body that did NOT look like a running model‚Äôs, and found a grit and a part of me that I never knew existed. And I was different after that race.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
‚Ä¢Running a Boston Qualifying time sometime in my 30‚Äôs, because I‚Äôm 5 days away from the big 3-0, and even though I‚Äôm a mother of 3 and have never been an athlete in my life, I AM qualifying for Boston. Soon. And I will be different after THAT race.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
I love to run. I am a different person because of running. And I will continue to become a different person through running. It‚Äôs not my everything, but it has let me experience things and grow in ways that MEAN everything to me. With a grateful heart, I logged 7 miles of speedwork this morning (splits in stories). Happy Global Running Day to my beautiful running community! Lots of love to each of you today ü§óüíõ

I know it seems like retaliation from the #metoo movement for all these men to vote about about things they have no clue about 👉🏻female bodies, female reproductive issues, pregnancy, or bearing children. 🤷🏻‍♀️ It baffles me that men are voting about our bodies and how we use them with no real experience in the issue. 🙄 I mean I would never even come close to trying to have a say in when men should be neutered. One thing I know for sure... I have a voice. And although my choices may be different than my fellow sister about what decisions I would make if I were pregnant I am going to hustle for their right to choose what to do with their body. My choice and my voice can impact who I support and how I support in any election. Are you willing to stand behind a candidate in a big way to support every women and all women, even the women who haven’t discovered their voice or their rights to decide what is best for their body? I’m not sure who I’ll will vote for in the next election but I know I’m ready this time to get out their and hustle!!! Who’s with me?  Drop an emoji below! 💪🏻💋💃🏽 #powertothepolls #rockthevote #femalesupremacy

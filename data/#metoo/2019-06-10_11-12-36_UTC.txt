We can't stay frozen. It's time to #EndFGM. At least 200 million girls and women alive today have suffered some form of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). While concentrated in Africa, FGM/C is also practiced in some communities of Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America and the Arab States. With globalization, girls in diaspora communities around the world are also at risk.  Let us make this the generation that abolishes FGM/C once and for all. Thanks to Unicef Chad for the most powerful mannequin challenge video yet. #childrenfirst #fgm #priviledge #childprotectioniseveryonesbusiness #endfgm #femalegenitalmutilation #childabuse #womenshealth #genderequality #womensright #patriachy #sexism #sexualviolence #childprotection #intersectionalfeminism #metoo #timesup #whyididntreport #blakelively #protectgirls #familyviolence #sexualassault #familyviolence #genderequality #endvaw #racism #misogyny #abuse #stopfgm #survivor

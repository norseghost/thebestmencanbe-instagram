I’ve painted this A3 public notice and will be taping it to the building site on Kingsland road where the Tesco used to be, at 12 midday, for anyone that wants to snaffle it. It won’t be signed though, so if you want it signed, DM me. Also, if you want a print-out to tape to your own local site, get in touch. Together we can rid the world of this strange behaviour ✨ #dalstonstreetart #concretedintothefoundations #endthecatcalling #metoo #streetart #shoreditchart #artcarbootfair @jealous_london @art_car_boot_fair @meanmail #feminist #contemporaryart #memesdaily #themisfortuneteller

Narratives.

One of the things I love doing is psychoanalising myself and my behaviours. It's dangerous territory but something I cannot help.

Last year I noticed I lived under narratives that 'identified' me based on my experiences.

Some positive.
Loving family. Amazing friends. Divinely protected.

Some negative.
Abandoned child. Sexual assault victim. Council kid. 
Although the positive lifted me, the negative limited me more. I felt like what I deserved was  minor and that I was incapable of achieving.

I then asked myself. What if I gave myself a blank slate. What if I lived like it was my first day. What if I let go of all the pain?

My world has swiftly changed since then.

Things aren't perfect - I often get panic attacks. Especially when I actively choose to think differently but mostly I feel renewed. Like their is no limit. Like I'm capable of anything.

My narrative is ongoing and forever changing. All I can do is be my best self today.

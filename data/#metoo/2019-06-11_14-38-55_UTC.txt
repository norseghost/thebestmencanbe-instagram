The Muses Mouth - Female Spoken Word/Open Mic was created in Nov 2017 in Nashville, TN in response to the #metoo movement.  It seeks to provide a space for women to share their stories and experiences while inspiring and supporting one another thru the art of poetry and performance.  Please join us Sunday June 23rd at 6pm at Tim Faulkner Gallery, Louisville KY for another edition!

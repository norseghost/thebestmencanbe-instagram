—> Difficult, but real <—
(Part 2)

The but.
.
.
Identifying myself as an #eldermillennial And a keen observer of human behaviour, I have always wondered for myself and from time to time for fellow #sapiens -

Why are we all constant #victims of #lowselfesteem , #identitycrisis , #depression , #anxiety etc etc etc?
.
.
 #beinghuman isn’t a real phenomenon, actually. It’s abstract- there’s no definition to humanity anymore. .
.
You have to be funny, speak well, have a career where coffee break conversations are about comparing 5-star hotels.. phew! Whatta dream life!! How many countries have you checked off your #bucketlist yet?
.
.
My darling #intellectuals where is the time to sit and count our blessings when we’re either validating ourselves by #swiperight (s) or looking for our #soulmates ..
.
.
We fall in love with the idea of #love - who has time to love a person anymore? It’s about how they love you and how much ‘space’ they can give you. Oops! Are you heartbroken that you didn’t get the #chandlerandmonica dreamy proposal??
Hey!! #metoo .
.
.
Did you fall into the trap of counting the zeros in your #ctc or the maze of #followyourpassion ?
.
.
.

Crazy how you get upset when you realise you don’t really have a passion when everyone else CLEARLY has a #purpose in their #pictureperfect lives. .
.
Where is the time to love yourself when you are constantly #tigerparenting your own self.. feeling pathetic about your #darkcircles instead of treating them as a #souvenir of the amount you pushed your body and mind #validate yourself with a certificate of success. 
And then you #fail at the most important question of life.
Who are you? Who are you if you strip yourself down to the last inch of being just a person. Would you be able to #loveyourself on a day when you have no one, nothing to plan.. OMG who are you?
.
.
#breathe . Let go of that existential angst. You’re better today than you have been before. Your childhood dreams have come true and been replaced by ones you can’t even define anymore. There’s a reason everyone hates that age old question- “where do you see yourself 5 years from today?”

Women have been punished for speaking out against the behavior of male coworkers for far too long. Often sweeping the issue under the rug to avoid repercussions. If only there was a way to warn other women of the creepy men in Dallas, Texas without backlash. Oh, but there is! There is a spreadsheet being updated in live time to inform women of a man's disturbing sexual advances. It seems like a strong form of communication, until their CEO ends up dead.

Thought we'd share a update on the Think Equal research program.⠀
Currently we have been focusing on being kind. ⠀
To hear the children celebrating other children's actions as kind is amazing.⠀
Our children have been challenging each other and adults about kindness and standing up for themselves and thier peers.⠀
Such exciting moments, children checking in on each other when thier peers are upset, asking if they are ok,  can they help them. Asking if they are lonely,  did they need a friend to play with. ⠀
It's just beautiful development, and the most important.⠀
Providing strong opportunities to develop thier being, provides them the confidence to build all thier other developmental areas with strength and to grow to be kind, respectful members of our society⠀

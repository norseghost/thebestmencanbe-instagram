Confidence 
Confidence isnâ€™t something you are born with. As children our confidence is installed in us by our parents/care givers.

Sadly for many reasons- some parents/ care givers are unable to provide affirmation to the child. And letâ€™s not forget society can be incredibly cruel. This can leave the child unsure of themselves as they grow up.

That doesnâ€™t mean confidence canâ€™t be achieved. The mistake people make is in believing that if they come out of their comfort zone they will lose what confidence they have. 
This is not the case - sure initially when you try something new - like travelling abroad on your own - youâ€™ll feel nervous.

But just take a deep breath - book the flight and hotel. Tell yourself you can do it - visualise yourself having a great time. 
I guarantee youâ€™ll have a great holiday and feel more confident in yourself.

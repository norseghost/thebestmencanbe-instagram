I had therapy this morning and opened up a teeny bit about my trauma. It was helpful but I was left feeling raw. We both agreed that working through my trauma is the key to helping me get past my anxiety. I have been able to make tremendous progress regarding how debilitating my anxiety has been historically but, there's still a ways to go. I really like my new therapist and feel pretty comfy with her. It feels like a good fit and I feel like I'll actually be able to let myself open up about my trauma so I can get through it and not have it hold me back like it currently does. #mentalhealthawareness #anxietyawareness #agoraphobia #traumasurvivor #metoo #mentalhealthmatters #cptsd

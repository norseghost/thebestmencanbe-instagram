“None of this work happens in a vacuum, it doesn’t happen by ourselves,” Aishah Shahidah Simmons, a filmmaker, writer and educator, tells PEOPLE. “

To recognize us collectively was just very powerful for me and important because we do this work collectively,” said Simmons, who directed and produced the award-winning NO! The Rape Documentary and recently launched #LoveWITHAccountability, a project focused on addressing child sex abuse. *
*
“We’re in this moment because of a momentum of work by so many,” she added. “It’s powerful to be honored.”

Key word: Try. Survivors of abuse get to take their power back that they should never have lost. We can’t control what people do to us especially when we were young and innocent. We can see people who have abusive traits as people who are SCARED. Remember the movie Ghost when the “bad guy” was scared half to death by an evil spirit coming to claim him? It was dark and it was scary. This is how someone feels when they keep so much negativity inside of them. They are scared of the outside world because they are scared of THEMSELVES. They can’t see themselves as an aspect of God so they have to terrorize the people around them. Unfortunately, some people with abusive characteristics are abusive because they were abused themselves as a child. All of the more reason to heal. ❤️

My heart breaks for these children.  They are everybody's responsibility. I often wonder why these people go after innocent children. No child should ever experience this type of trauma. I wholeheartedly feel that the Justice system needs to be more harsh on these predators!! I'm going to get it done. In the mean time I ask that every adult person keep a close eye on not only your children but every child. #monster #metoo #childrensbooks #protectourchildren #childabuse #childabuseawareness #predators

Honestly, I am blown away!!!!! I am so grateful, so humbled by your kindness, and so excited to help others suffer less.  I promised to provide some of the feedback I have received in the past 2.5 weeks and rereading the notes validates the calling I have received. 🍀

Thank you for all your prayers, thoughts and encouragement to stay true.  I love my sons with all my heart, always will, and you and they have inspired me.  Please continue to pray for them as they need it most and are the true victims. 🍀

My peace offerings have repeatedly been thrown away by the true abuser in Virginia paying the high priced “prestigious” law firm and calling the shots.  My former love is in fact a victim, a puppet in many ways, as are others.  I have always had empathy, ever since I found out 16 years ago, after seeing a picture of a bloody bite mark in an older women’s arm after he was fired for abusing his power at the world’s largest generic drug manufacturer where he served as an Executive while sleeping with two of his employees.  It’s terribly sad.  Had the #metoo movement been around then, he’d be another posterboy. He’a admitted to much more, yet was empowered to continue. 🍀
A cycle of abuse takes courage and strength to stop.  I was the only one that would stand up to him, and therefore became the target.  I was asked to help and did.  You know who stayed with him. 🙄
My own Mother is afraid of him and his power so she turned on me partly in fear of not seeing her 3 grandchildren.  She knows firsthand what happened at his son’s wedding, and how I took action, and our group from New England had to change rooms at 11Pm and hide, then file a police report in the morning. 🍀

However, the new non-profit is founded on TRUTH, AUTHENTICITY and TRANSPARENCY and I’ll have a spot reserved on the Board when my former love is ready, given the power that the combined story will have in helping other families struggling with a malevolent bully with a track record a mile long.  #notafraid  #neverhavebeen 🍀

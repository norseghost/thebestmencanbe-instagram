How I wish I somehow was able to get more photos from “other’s” prespective but since it’s usually just me... It’s always taken from my perspective. It’s either, I’m not in the photo and it’s just portraits of the babies or it’s a selfie of us. 😂 And when I ask husband to take Photos, it’s so obviously staged because he just straight up can’t take a nice legit candid photo like these. #InTheMoment.  Whereas, I have tons  of great ones of him and the kids! But also, it’s because I’m always so self aware and not liking the photos he takes because the angle was wrong and this and that. I’m going to try really hard to not care too much about my appearance and be genuine because that’s what my kids will remember me by, in their memories anyways. Not what the picture perfect photo portrayed. (I’ve got to make husband be more proactive in taking photos so he can get good at it 😂) but for now, as long as when my children look back at their childhood photos they will know that it was momma behind the camera all those times... capturing these wonderful moments and allowing not just her but her children as they grow up to be able to cherish these fleeting moments in time, what she saw every second that she was with them.. their laughter and smiles and to tell them the story behind the photos. What they were laughing about. What made them grin from ear to ear, what they were so happy about when they looked into their brother’s, sister’s or father’s eyes. Or even at me, at my eyes with that camera slightly off to the side ..hidden and sneaking a shot of that perfect moment as they stare at me and SMILE. But I’m thankful that I’ve always managed to get at least one photo of the day I first met them on that hospital bed to cherish forever. I love this photo of me & Joci 🐻. And yes I did not have time to change into a gown! Had her still in my regular clothes 😂. #Memories #Motherhood #MomLife. Letter to moms: be in those photos!! #MeToo! #OdeToMotherHood #CaptureThatMoment, even if you didn’t have your eye brows drawn or your makeup on. 😂 #TakeNoteFathers #TakeThatPicture of your wife bonding with your child. Each and every one of you will cherish it forever. ♥️

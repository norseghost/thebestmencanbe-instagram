Dear #metoo victims,
You have lived some of the worst days of your lives, lived under the extremely dark clouds. We know about the demons you fight with in your heads. We know about the fears you carry in your hearts. We do not sympathize you but understand the hardships you have been through. Although we have not experienced the same kind of pain like you but we feel you. We feel you when you shiver down the spine while walking by a group of men. We know how bad it makes you feel when people blame the victims instead of cursing the evils. We know how badly you want to speak up but you numb yourself down. We understand you are a little fragile within, no matter how bold you are from the outside. They say everything happens for a reason and you, every day of your life, wonder about the reasons behind the stabs you got from your own family members. We understand how miserable it makes you feel when people laugh at sexual abuse cases. We understand how terrible it makes you feel when people think it's just a mere joke. We understand how little you feel when speaking about it is considered as attention seeking. We empathize you when the aunties question your clothing every now and then. We really appreciate the way you are moving forward and rising above all the disgust moments. We appreciate you for the courage you gathered to speak against what's wrong and unacceptable. We appreciate you even when you are silently fighting due to personal reasons but we wish you good luck for when you will open your mouth and fight for yourself. Openly calling for help is indeed difficult but trust us, difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations.

"Why didn’t I report!? Because I laughed, because I didn’t leave when I could. When he flirted with me I didn’t tell him to stop. 
When he told me I’m hotter than my friend I didn’t stop him. when he told me he wanted to kiss me I didn’t slap him. When his hands were between my thighs I didn’t make a sound. I couldn’t. I thought I deserved it. I believed that no one would believe me. That was probably a joke, he said he was high it wasn’t his fault, he couldn’t control, I believed it and I wasn’t particularly stopping him. It’s fine I told myself, I can’t tell my friends they’ll think I am a whore. They will blame me. Laugh at me. I couldn’t have my friends laugh at me and who would even believe me. He is President, everyone knows his name and I am nobody. he doesn’t even remember my name. If only I can avoid him in the hallways I’ll be fine. It will be fine because he doesn’t even remember that night.  He will graduate and I won’t have to see him ever again. But his hands between my thighs haunted me. Every time I touch myself, I believed I deserved it, maybe I flirted with him, maybe I should have slapped him, maybe I shouldn’t have laughed or maybe I should have just let him do all those things instead of resisting, a part of me wanted to hurt herself, punish herself for being me. I didn’t report because I thought I deserved it, I deserved to be punished"

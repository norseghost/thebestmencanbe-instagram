Well, this is going to offend a lot of people but let's face it. 
I see many magazines and articles stating that - WOMEN ARE THE FUTURE. 
If you ask me about this I'd say no. No, we're not the future. Because according to me - MEN AND WOMEN together holding onto each other and giving each other equal opportunities is the future. 
Nature is made up of  both male and female. One gender overpowering another doesn't do any good to anyone. And, definitely doesn't define feminism. 
Respect one another and appreciate how far we've come and hope for a good future. 
By this we save a lot of hatred and give out love. - Sahana Yaseer Khan @shoona08

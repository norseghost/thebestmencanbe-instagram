this is noa jansma, a design student from the netherlands, who created @dearcatcallers. @dearcatcallers was a project in which she took a selfie with every cat caller she had for the entire month of september 2017 to spread awareness about street harassment. jansma created @dearcatcallers after she was in a conversation in class about street harassment and found that most of the males in her class didnâ€™t even know that catcalling was a problem or even existed. as you can see in these pictures, the cat caller is often smiling and happy, while she has a frown on her face. she did this to show how little the harassers cared about her or her feelings. @dearcatcallers was one of the first of its kind because it started before the #MeToo movement and reached followers worldwide.

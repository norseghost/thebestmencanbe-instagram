SlutWalk TLV - Israel, 2019
"A world that notices how hard it f***s over women... might eventually try to change that. Maybe. Might. It’s a start, anyway."
Heather Havrilesky
SlutWalk is a transnational movement of protest marches calling for an end to rape culture, including victim blaming and slut shaming of sexual assault victims. Specifically, participants protest against rape being referred to any aspect of a woman's appearance.

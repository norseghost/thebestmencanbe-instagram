This is excerpts from a very hastily written piece back from performance composition in 2017! Crazy. It's supposed to be in the style of Karen Finley and the performance included me covering myself in strawberry sauce, marshmallows, and sprinkles...as you do üçì

I thought it would fit #DearJune days 8/9 really well: connections and bodies. Obviously this is not about the fun connections, instead it's about those horrible moments women face in public spaces, men taking advantage, and all the stories we've heard in recent years following the #MeToo movement.

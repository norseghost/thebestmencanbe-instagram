What a turn out! We couldn't have had such a successful Community Advocacy Day without our awesome supporters of advocates, survivors and community members. Thank you for showing up and putting your voice to action! #protectallchildren #enddv #endabuse #preventdv 
The advocacy continues: Find your local representative at https://vote.sos.ri.gov/ and urge them to support bill S321/H5489 to protect ALL RI children on domestic violence restraining orders now!

(Warning:  I’m going down the rabbit hole with this one...). This has to be one of the best interviews I’ve seen of Kanye... he gets it... which is why he seems so crazy... (and why raised eyebrows are apart of my daily dose of human contact with this a simplified assessment of what is known to me)  He knows that the planet could be a better place and that it wants to ascend to a higher frequency, it wants to vibe at its highest potential, Science says everything is energy - that we all know, understand and accept - he knows that the energy produced by the thoughts and actions of people is what keeps us stuck in a negative and fear based patriarchal society... that if everyone was responsible for their thoughts and chose to vibe from a more positive place then we could easily lift the vibration of the planet.  That’s why they push self love and self care... one individual taking responsibility to make themselves feel good puts out so much positive energy, imagine if all 8 billion people on the planet did that? 🤯 Where would we be then?  His #metoo comment made sense to me too.  He was shutdown and as a feminist, I can totally agree, but I then replayed what he was saying... his concern was for all the fear-based energy being released.  It’s like 1 step forward, 2 steps back.  All these men worrying about their past selves and putting all that negative energy into the world... I think he just wants to work out a safe way for men to be absolved of that without all the negative energy that’s immediately attached and released; but that requires people to understand and I feel like he has trouble articulating his thoughts outside of a studio... the pressure of the moment scrambles him and he comes off crazy, when everything he says is rooted in an attempt to logically understand the importance of finding your spiritual path whatever it may be and doing your part to lift the vibe of the planet.  On top of that, it is now a new bucket list item to get to go to one of his Sunday Services... it’s the only church I wanna go too... and with the way I vibe, I’m gonna make it happen one day! ✌🏼🙊 💖#testify #jesuswalks #kanyewest #thegreaterfool #kanye2020 #ye #yeezy #balance

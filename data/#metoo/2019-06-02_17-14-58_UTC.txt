For the domestic violence survivor, often times we have spent so long in survival mode that we can't even identify what we are feeling. We just feel numb. .

This graph and coordinating oil chart can help us figure out underlying emotions, and slowly work to uncover them and support them. .

Buried emotions don't make for a healthy human. And survivors are often at the highest risks of autoimmune disorders, mental health disorders, and long term health issues because of it. We have to do the work to uncover these emotions, and heal them/release them. You can't just "get over it" or "move on" or "forgive and forget". And in case anyone tells you otherwise, know that it can take 10 years after domestic violence and trauma for your system to regulate itself again completely, working to heal what you're feeling and why is so important in terms of long term health. .

There are ***NO BAD EMOTIONS***. You are allowed to feel whatever it is you feel. No shame. No judgment. No negativity. Emotions are normal and human and we've often been shamed for feeling them. Break that cycle for yourself. Learn to identify and embrace to allow yourself whole body wholeness. .

I'm always available by DM if you want to talk through this, or need the graphics bigger than an Insta feed ;) .

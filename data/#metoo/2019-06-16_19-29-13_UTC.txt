After The September Issue, a documentary film about the most important issue of American VOGUE - the September issue - was released. Because of this film, Grace Coddington, the creative director of the world famous fashion magazine became famous herself. She wrote this memoir which I have a divided opinion on: On the one hand I like how she describes how fashion used to be in the old times (but to be honest, I think I do prefer shootings today with amazing, nice and egoless people) but these times did have a magic to it. Back then - shootings for an editorial took like two weeks, whereas today more image material has to be produced in less time. On the other hand I think she could have gone a bit deeper, as some memories which she describes seem sometimes superficial as some moments in her life which were quite tough - she has a car accident and lost her unborn baby and was never able to get pregnant anymore - she only loses one-two sentences about it. Nevertheless, I liked reading about the magic of the “old” fashion world and about all these amazing people Coddington worked throughout her career (however to note: Some names of photographers she worked with a lot have been connected to the #MeToo accusations).

Class of ‘99 Reunion weekend fun. It was great seeing all of these folks and more as we got reintroduced to the new cool spaces on campus. The new Remy amphitheater next to the New Dorms is stunning. This photo doesn’t even do it justice. Can’t wait for the #barbarawalters campus center to open this fall and wish I could have made art at the Hemibold Visual Arts center. #sarahlawrence is doing some great things. Lyde Sizer’s seminar on “What’s next? The Politics of the #metoo movement” had me wanting to reenroll. Great weekend. Hope to see even more of you at our 25th. #ilovesarahlawrence #sarahlawrencealumni #classof1999

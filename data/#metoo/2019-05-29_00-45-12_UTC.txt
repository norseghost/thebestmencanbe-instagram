My 30-minute TV special about my journey of overcoming cancer aired for the first time on Trinity Broadcast Network (TBN) on Sunday!⠀
⠀
In case you missed it, you still have a chance to purchase my new book “How I Beat Cancer in 90 Days” for about another week before the official release to retail later this summer.⠀
⠀
You can use the link in my bio to donate and request the book on TBN’s website.⠀
⠀
And if you missed my special, tune in Monday, June 3 at 9:30 PM EST/6:30 PM PST to catch the replay!

i was 7 and 12 and there have been many events since then. these events are what brought me to learn more about feminism. i feel like most women donâ€™t feel so strongly about double standards and dangers in everyday life for females just because. Our emotions and fears in present day likely come from past experiences, no matter how large or small. #metoo

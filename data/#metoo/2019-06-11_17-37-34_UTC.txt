I'm always thinking of new ways to get in touch with the community.
.
And sometimes we overlook potential oppoutunities right in front of us.
.
But if you don't stand up and speak what's on your mind.
.
Someone else will.
.
The least you could do is try.
.
This could be applied to areas of our lives other than business as well.

"A broken heart still beats, that's why it's so painful..." ðŸ’”ðŸ’—ðŸ’”
M. 
Aside from ALL my diseases attacking my body at f'ing ONCE, my heart and soul hurt from so much loss and the inevitable horrible grief that always comes with it. 
Right now there is so much going on at the same time, there is no way I could EVEN think about allowing myself to go through this emotionally. It would overwhelm me so unfortunately I don't have that option at the moment to fully allow myself to FEEL/START the healing process.
One day at a time, one battle at a time. That's the best I can do at this point. It's going to have to be enough.

Song is "Radiant Warmth" ðŸŽ¶

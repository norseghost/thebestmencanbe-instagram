The fatherhood stolen from my father (pictured above) as he struggled with alcoholism. The joy stolen from me as I was a young boy taking abuse for my siblings.\n\nI take back my my voice, the voice I altered to bring peace. My body, the body given so that those I grew up with would not have to feel broken, abused, or tortured. And I take back my being and every part of me that resonates with #metoo because yes I've been there and I can relate.\n\nHappy Father's Day to the the lonely. The broken. The fatherless. The Motherless. The overall parentless. To the Hopeless. Those too scared to speak up. Those with uncertainty in their bones. Just know that I, some random individual in this world cares for you, have been there, and I wish you whoever you are a joyful weekend.\n\nHere's to overcoming the years of intergenerational trauma due to hate, anger, starvation, torture, assimilation, foster care abuse, alcoholism, drug addiction, and so much more. This is a happy Father's day to the few, the few that that are actually many, and to the few who are/were/ever will be me. With words I'd have wanted to hear near this day, just know whoever and wherever you are, that you are in fact loved.\n\n#fathersday #chicago #illinois #michigan #Tennessee #Georgia #midwest #fosterkid #nativeamerican #itsokaynottobeokay #intergenerationaltrauma #ptsd #love #addiction #trauma #hopefortheday #family #alcoholism #indian #ndn #parents #native #americanindian #indigenous #love #hope #resilient #reclaimyourpower"

                        "text": "The feminist Iliad. Song of Achilles meets #MeToo. I\u2019ve heard this book described in various pithy ways and it\u2019s true: this different perspective on the Trojan War is a manifesto for female survival, empowerment and remembrance. Unlike Circe or Song of Achilles, two recent retellings by Madeline Miller that I loved, The Silence of the Girls has little to do with the ancient Greek Gods, but rather is very much focused on the humans\u2014the foul, flawed, brutal, selfish men who fight the wars and make their conquests, and more significantly, the women who are their captive commodities, to be used and abused, again and again, as slaves, prostitutes, and even wives and mothers to their children. Pat Barker pulls no punches as she tells the story of Briseis, the captive queen awarded to Achilles whom Agamemnon also covets. Later in the book, she weaves in some very affecting narrative from Achilles\u2019s perspective, but the majority of the eloquent story is focussed on bearing witness to the tragedy and suffering that is war to women.\n(One criticism I\u2019ve heard is the anachronistic dialogue\u2014characters sound like contemporary Brits rather than ancient Greeks. Didn\u2019t bother me, once I was used to it.)\nHighly recommend, and I will be checking out other books by this acclaimed author. #thesilenceofthegirls #patbarker #classics #retelling #trojanwar #theiliad #greekmyths #feministfiction #bookreview #iamreading #readingnow #justread #booklife #bookstagram #readmore  #bookaddict #booksofinstagram #reader #igreads #book #bookstagrammer #booklife #bookish #booklove #bookreader #bookaholic  #borntoread #readersofinstagram \n#readmore #babygotbooks"

The Goddess loves you for who you are. You don’t need to do anything or be anything to prove your worth. 
You don’t need to be ‘good’. Nothing is needed.

Imagine how this would feel and watch your world change. 
Miranda Gray ‘Spiritual Messages For Women’. The ‘good girl’ is a social construct that has been used to control our behaviour for generations.

The time has come to shed these constraints of how we must behave to be considered ‘likeable’, to be valued.

You don’t need to be anything other than who you are, your worth is intrinsic.

It does not diminish because you don’t feel like smiling, or if you disagree, or if you speak your mind because you have your own opinion. 
You don’t always have to be ‘nice’, your anger is valid, justified and needs to be heard. 
Your story is yours and your experiences donor need to be hidden or denied. 
The Divine Feminine stands tall, stands proud and stands up to be counted. 
There will be no shame in her eyes. 
She will not be quiet, she will not be mean and subdued. 
The energy of the enchantress is the fire in your belly and the roar at the back of your throat. 
It’s time to be heard.

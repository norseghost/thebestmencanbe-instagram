Are you an abuse survivor and looking for a supportive community? Join me tomorrow at 4:30PM (PST) for #ASCA. This month we will explore how genuine authority is something that is earned by virtue of a personâ€™s experience and expertise. As survivors our experience with authority is skewed due to being overpowered and controlled. Join us here: http://rachelgrantcoaching.com/asca #beyondsurviving #coaching #metoo #sexualabuse

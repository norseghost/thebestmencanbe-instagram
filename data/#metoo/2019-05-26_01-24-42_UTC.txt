Funny story.
I had a follower ask if I had attended North East Elementary School ... apparently she was one of my teachers and my face hasn’t changed much since I was 6! 👧🏻😂 I also still love rocks and think they’re “neet”!
.
I’ve noticed a lot of new followers and thought I’d say hi (by a lot I mean about 15 ✊🏼😂 just keeping it real)! You don’t have to scroll back far to gather enough information to piece my story together but why am I here, in this space sharing so much? Because I know how valuable a relatable soul can be. I spent years feeling trapped inside my own head, broken and ashamed of my past. Today I realize how each moment prepared me for this. I have endured much, overcome much and by the grace of God I am unashamed enough to share it. I don’t need a pat on the back or a “you’re so brave” message ... I share because I feel called, most of the time it’s easy, sometimes it’s not but I can’t ignore the urge to make use of this life of mine.

So ... if you’re here for a well curated feed, I’m not your girl. I’m raw and real, sometimes hard to digest but always authentic. I talk about drug abuse, sexual abuse, teen pregnancy, adoption, marriage, sex, parenting, mental health and our nomadic life and not necessarily in that order. Sometimes I post every day and sometimes the words don’t flow and instead of forcing it, I take a break. I love the community I’ve met through these squares but my mental health and my family comes first. I’m an open book and always happy to chat through DM’s if you’re not comfortable asking questions on my feed!

So tell me, what brought you here and why have you stayed?

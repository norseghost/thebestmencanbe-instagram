This picture of me and my mom made me smile today. All of those people in the background? They are all there to see me give a speech. This is a take back the night keynote I was giving one spring and the very first time my mom came to see me speak in person. It was the first time she got to see how I turned my darkest moments into my life’s work of dismantling rape culture. It was a proud day for the both of us and that’s why it makes me smile big today. Cherish these moments. Shout out to my mom the warrior queen who fights back from illness every single day. She’s my inspiration.❤️❤️❤️#metoo

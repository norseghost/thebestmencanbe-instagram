Sheryl SandergCQ-Roll Call,Inc.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a bad place \u2014 no one\u2019s ever gotten promoted without a one-on-one meeting, I feel confident in saying that,\u201d Sandberg tells \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d host Gayle King Friday. \u201cSenior men right now are nine times more hesitant to travel with a woman and six times more likely to hesitate to have a work dinner.\u201d Women \u2014 and especially women of color \u2014 don\u2019t get the same amount of mentoring as men, \u201cwhich means we\u2019re not getting an equal seat at the table,\u201d Sandberg says. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to not harass us, you need to not ignore us, either.\u201d The study reports that the fear factor grew in concurrence with the rise of the massive #MeToo social media movement founded by activist #TaranaBurke and fueled by a torrent of models and actresses accusing #HarveyWeinstein and #BillCosby of sexual harassment and assault."

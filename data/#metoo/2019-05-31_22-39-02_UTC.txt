Share & Discuss: How has the #MeToo Movement impacted you personally?
.
At RISE, we hear clients, staff, and volunteers alike share their memories of seeing the #MeToo hashtag grow into a full-on movement.
.
What do you remember? How does it continue to affect you today?
.
Since #MeToo, calls to the RISE hotline increased 50%, and our counseling services are in higher demand than ever before.
.
That's why we're asking for your help to raise $20,000 by June 30 to support local survivors. Please consider donating today at RISEslo.org (link in bio)

Resistance has been so persistent with me lately, that I can honestly say it is a reason I have stopped writing on here. Resistance is that little voice in your head that tells you all the reasons you shouldn't do something, although you know it's in your best interest to do it.

I used to fight these moments with alcohol. Distract myself and pull at all means to stay busy, socialize, be out and about.. Anything but by myself, with my own voice echoing inside my head.

Nowadays, when I feel resistance, I force myself to sit still; sit with the uncomfortable. Because I know all too well, that girl, that voice inside my head, she is a convincing one. And if I listen long enough I will be convinced to distract myself, to move on, to let go, to stop listening. And that is in no one's better interest, and definitely not mine.

Resistance is a way to remind us we are on the right path. And, if we keep going, and we keep fighting it, that voice will get smaller and you will get stronger. Xx

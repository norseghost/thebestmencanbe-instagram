I was partly raised Catholic ( I like the new pope, in some of his decisions....) & support all the institutions shown. I just also support accountability.

Oldie graphic/political art. Aside, from the fact people have known about the issues within these institutions before, camera phones were invented. Go back not so far in US history & most of the behaviors our society now considers bad, in Hollywood, the Justice System, & the Catholic Church towards peoples-of-color, women, the poor (if your both or all the above) used to be common & accepted behaviors. 
Now people are either in denial, underestimate the problem or are just apathetic...#oldart #matthewjpowell #politicalart #digitalart #graphicdesign #blacklivesmatter #metoo

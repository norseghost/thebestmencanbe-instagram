It is no surprise that society often views women as less than, sensitive and weak compared to men. It's time to debunk that misogynistic belief and realize what we truly are. As women, we are FIGHTERS. We fight for Equality. We fight for Change. We fight for reproductive Rights. We fight to have a Voice. We fight for our BODY. We fight for US. We are fighters and we fight HARD. #fightlikeagirl

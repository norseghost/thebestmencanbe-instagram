Who would think your child could be capable of taking drugs at age 13? How do you help your child overcome this disease? How do you get back your life, if you're the one taking the drugs and alcohol? Here to talk to us about how drugs and alcohol destroyed and reshaped her life, is Mehek Gidwani, who’s been in recovery since 2011. She shares her firsthand experience about taking drugs and alcohol and talks about discovering the roots of the illness, the know-how behind the addiction and how she has found freedom from the obsession. She’s now a trained Recovery Coach and yoga therapist and has started her own addiction recovery program helping others recover.

She’s our gentle but very strong NRIWoman and this is her story.

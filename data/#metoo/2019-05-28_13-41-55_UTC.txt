Do you know in rural parts of Ethiopia, child marriage after age the 15 is not considered early? In fact, in 2013, 71 percent of  the Ethiopian women, who were interviewed, stated they entered marriage before the age 15. The main source of child marriage is caused by gender inequality. With a fear of being called too old and losing societal status, girls don’t hesitate to enter marriage before completing high school. Sign the #MeTooEthiopia petition and fight the injustice women face for just being a human being. Sign the petition and show child marriage is not tradition, but a crime.

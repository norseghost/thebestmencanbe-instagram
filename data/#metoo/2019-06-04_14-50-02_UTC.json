                        "text": "A year ago this past Friday, I delivered the commencement speech at the high school where my oldest daughter had attended while she was in treatment. It happened to be scheduled the same day my younger daughter was graduating high school. The decision to follow through with my commitment was a heartbreaking one. As incredible as it was to be able to touch these lives that I was so privileged to speak in front of, my heart was breaking that I missed my own child walking across her high school graduation stage. As I reminisce on that day, and after rereading the letter that was sent to me, I am honored and proud that I was given this opportunity. Instead of bailing when dates changed because of things that were outside peoples control. I felt, and still do, that the right thing to do was to honor the commitment I had made so many months prior to this day. There are so many choices in life that are difficult,  and at the time none of us know if we are making the correct decision. I say this to you now, no matter what your choice, not everyone is going to be supportive. All you can do is:  continue to be who you are; approach every situation with honesty, integrity, and character; don\u2019t ever allow the opinions of others dictate your actions; and to the best of your ability, live your life free from regrets. #grateful #inspiredliving #unconditionallove #survivor #domesticviolence #childabuse #childsexualabuse #ptsd #cptsdsurvivor #metoo #nevergiveup #loveconquers #author #speaker #advocate #mentor #lifecoach"

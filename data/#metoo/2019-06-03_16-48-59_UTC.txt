LEFT:
Depressed. Newly single mom. PTSD so bad I couldn’t function at work. Hated job. Struggled getting out of bed. On heavy meds. 
RIGHT: 
25lbs down. Happy. Embracing single mother hood. New career. New home. PTSD no longer runs my daily life. Wake up smiling and excited for the day. Completely off meds. -It’s a mind, body and soul thing! What’s happening on the inside will affect the outside, and it will affect what you attract into your life. Work on getting your mind, your heart, your spirit into alignment, and the rest will follow. It won’t just happen over night. You got to consistently work at it everyday! I’m not where I want to be yet, but I’m not where I used to be.

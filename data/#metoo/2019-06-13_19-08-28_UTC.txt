My my my how times have changed. The first, from 2015 is a compilation of "funny" over stepping the boundaries moments. The next, recent misconduct accusations and the final a man's take on too-close behavior. Until humans admit that energy is real, we will not understand why some people would be offended by a hug, a smelling of one's hair, a touch, a certain smile. These can be innocuous or they can be deadly to the soul and the differentiation is the energy in which is it given. If it is given with an energy of superiority in which unspoken power dynamics are at play, it will feel like soul rape. The victim will experience cognitive dissonance and feel a part of themselves was taken but not understand why. Until the patriarchy understands that it cannot project it's own or take sexual energy from women in non-consensual ways, unawakened male energies will remain clueless perpetrators. A woman's sexual energy is sacred and shared only when it is safe and appreciated. It is sacred and cannot be slung around for control or likeability, as we see powerful men doing for themselves. The masculine has never understood this about their own sexual energy. The feminine has had to protect herself from the sexual energy of her father, brothers, uncles, bosses and friends who don't think they're being sexual, all while projecting sexual energy. "No you can't kiss me on the neck or stroke my leg -- you're a relative, employer, or platonic relationship." Projecting sexual energy onto a person, even when the visible behavior seems miniscule will result in angry, fearful, resentful, powerless divine feminines because you have taught them they do not have equal say. Masculines who do not change will reap their karma.

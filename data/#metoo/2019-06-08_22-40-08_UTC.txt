This is my gift to you son. I wish you more, on your eighth grade graduation. A book filled with beautiful messages. I cannot be there, as I am facing seven months of your absence. It guts me, yet they are the circumstances that bind me. One day youâ€™ll know my truth, and have someone help you navigate that. I wish you understood how deeply I care and appreciate you for making me a mother and granting the gift of selflessness. I wish you happiness, pure unencumbered joy. I wish you strength to find your way when life is hard and light to lift your heart. I wish you love always.

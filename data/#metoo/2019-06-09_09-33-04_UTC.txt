@okifreshprepping is good for the whole family 👏🏼 I had a couple leftovers and didn’t want them to go to waste so we each had one for dinner, I turned my chicken and rice into a lil tortilla goodness with salsa, cheese & sour cream! I’m not a fan of peas so I always give them to Danny boy - he LOVES anything green or colorful or “chicky” aka chicken! Also we got a new to us kids table and all ate dinner together at Danny boys kids table 😂

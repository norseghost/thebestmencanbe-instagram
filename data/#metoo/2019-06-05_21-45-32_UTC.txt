“Root chakra”
.
.
.
Angry poem for the women .
.
Do you really think that’s OK? 
No it’s not 
it’s completely not OK 
and undoubtedly inappropriate.
Just because I hum while I’m cooking over my campfire
 just because I dream soundly under bridges
 just because I look pretty on the road with my thumb out 
DOES NOT mean you can fucking touch me 
if you ever try that again 
with me or any other woman 
I will fucking kill you .

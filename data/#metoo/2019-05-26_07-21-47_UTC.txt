Repost from @overcoming.abuse using @RepostRegramApp - don’t compare trauma!!! like ever!! just because someone else’s trauma was different than your own, does not make you any less valid. it’s a coping mechanism to minimize your pain and suffering while saying “well so and so had it so much worse than me!!” although believing that might have helped you survive such abuse, it limits your ability to heal and your self compassion!! it’s a hard habit to break, believe me i know and still struggle with it today, but when you learn to embrace your suffering as valid, a giant weight will be lifted off of your shoulders. it won’t happen immediately but soon you will notice yourself smiling more, laughing harder, and loving more:)) YOU ARE VALID !

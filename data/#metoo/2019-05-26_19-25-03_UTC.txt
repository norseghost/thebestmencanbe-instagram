*DAY, 27TH MAY*
Many abused children cling to the hope that growing up will bring escape and freedom but it is not so

The personality formed in the environment of coercive control is not well adapted to adult life. The survivor is left with fundamental problems in basic trust, autonomy, and initiative. The child approaches the task of early adulthood――establishing independence and intimacy――burdened by major impairments in self-care, in cognition and in memory, in identity, and in the capacity to form stable relationships. 
The child is still a prisoner of their childhood; attempting to create a new life, they reencounter the trauma.

On this special occasion of Children's Day, we would be talking about *Child Abuse.* Warien Rose Foundation

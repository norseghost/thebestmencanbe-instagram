Ellen Degeneres opened up about being sexually assaulted by her stepfather on David Letterman's new show, "My Next Guest Needs No Introduction." She said, "I'm angry at myself because, you know, I didn't, I was too weak to stand up to him, I was 15 or 16. It's a really horrible, horrible story and the only reason I'm actually going to go into detail about it is because I want other girls to not ever let someone do that."⠀

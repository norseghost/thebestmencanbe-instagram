"I Am Grateful for the grace to start my new book this year, finished it and now its published and available.This used to be something too big for me to do but God did this through me and I'm so grateful.

My name is Titi Ogunleye, I am a trained Christian pre-marital counsellor and I help singles with their relationships and I teach on how to wait for the right spouse in order to have the desired marriage." - @relationshipmatters_

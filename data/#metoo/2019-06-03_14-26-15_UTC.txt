I’ll be taking the month of June away from social media as an act of self-care. As many of you know from my previous posts, things have been somewhat difficult recently. So I’m going to take the next few weeks to spend time with myself and my loved ones. I’m moving next week (!!!), I’m in the process of applying for jobs, and I have a few trips planned just in this month – so it’ll be a whirlwind of change and excitement! 
Just to leave on a note of encouragement: always remember that it is in you! Whatever “it” may be for you – your courage, strength, resilience, power, kindness, compassion. Whatever “it” is – wear it as your armor and never forget who you are and just how far you’ve come. Sending so much love to all of you! ♥️

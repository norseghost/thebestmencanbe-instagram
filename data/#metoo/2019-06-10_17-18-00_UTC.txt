I've written before of the challenge for an artist to make 'politically engaged' art that is at the same time visually arresting. Many try; the vast majority fail.
But Andrea Bowers, in her extraordinary work 'Open Secrets Part I & II, 2018, 2019, has shot a bulls-eye. Detailing over 130 indivuduals' responses to #MeToo and #TimesUp accusations of sexual harrassment made against them, along with the accusations themselves and the current state of play with the allegations, court cases, etc, the work is compelling viewing. Featuring a vast majority straight men but also a few gay men and two women, the work raises issues of power and justice, but also more nuanced questions of trial in the court of public opinion. 
Watching people engrossed in the texts, I can't help recalling photos I have seen of Cultural Revolution China, where posters of public denounciation were commonplace and the right of reply was never a possibility. But there is no denying the enormous power - and some would say public service - of Bowers' work. For me it's the most memorable work in Art Basel Unlimited. Now if I could just get a selfie with Knight Landsmann... @artbasel #andreabowers #artbasel2019 @andreabowers #TimesUp #MeToo

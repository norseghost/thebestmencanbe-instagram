Whenever someone asks why I'm a feminist, I show them a picture like this, of a woman burned with acid by her father or husband. Sex-based violence is still a major threat to women globally.
"That doesn't happen in the US though." Besides the fact that it occasionally does, what makes you think the US is so much more important than other places in the world? Are we not all children of God? Why should we not care about others globally? 
When people denounce feminism I think of child brides, of girls denied an education, of the fact that childbirth is the leading cause of death for teenage girls. I think of how these not-feminists don't want to do anything.
So why don't people care? They say it's good in the US so they're not feminists. Is it because these girls aren't often white? Aren't often Christian? Jesus ministered to those who weren't white and weren't Christian. We are certainly not above such love.

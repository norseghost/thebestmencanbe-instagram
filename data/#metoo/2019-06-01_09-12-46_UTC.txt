When Trump calls Meghan on UK soil ‘Nasty’  it’s time to show we women are all NASTY. And we can show it with our nastiness fighting back against an attack on one woman. Get ready to take on all of our NASTYNESS - we Women are Ready!! Solidarity with Women. Solidarity with Meghan. We will not be attacked by words or deeds.

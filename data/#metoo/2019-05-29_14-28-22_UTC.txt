A lot has occurred in the past few years. I have lost some friends, I will get the look of disbelief of how could she have done that. The look of she gave up on her marriage perhaps because they did not know what happened behind closed doors. Whatever reason you learn who you true friends and family are after a major life event. My family and friends are incredible. Four years later, I think of the initial support of my family, this is what had got me to the place I am now. I was bought up by parents who empowered me to make a difference because they always did and still do. My family and extended family are incredible role models of people making a difference and creating change. We were never silent on issues that mattered to us. I am blessed to have this my  upbringing. I see the future generation empowered that is why changed was essential. Be the change, be unstoppable and do what you your inner drive, inner voice had prepared you to do. Do it all through your walk in faith, it won't let you down, I am proof! Empowered living!

I put together my first immersive experience "Granny's House" over the weekend at a small arts/music festival. The experience was a Red Riding Hood/#metoo theme. The audience was so kind and supportive! Next time I want to involve more improv artists and make it darker. Thank you for an incredible weekend Country Club 😍

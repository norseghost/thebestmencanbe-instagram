poured ya'll up a cup of hot sex on the latest episode of the @blackgirlinom podcast ‚òïÔ∏è‚Å£ ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£
my friend and pleasure sister @evyan.whitney joined @deunivory and I to destigmatize pleasure and honestly it's going to be the first conversation of many related to sexuality because so many of us are repressed and traumatized and I'm on a healing journey from both as I'm sure so many of you are. we need more spaces for black women and femmes who have been harmed by rape culture, patriarchal myths of what "good girls" do and don't do, and overall misinformation about what a loving, enjoyable sexual relationship with yourself, let alone with another, feels like. i first opened up about how the first place I was able to fully sit with, be heard and *held* about my experiences with sexual assault was on retreat in Bali with 21 other women of color. and now, on our podcast. heard, affirmed, and held by all of you. so, yeah, #metoo. ‚Å£

thank you to our global community of listeners for already sharing with us how much this episode means to ya'll. we did this for and with you. and thank you to my #bgio work wife and cohost deun for your phenomenal commitment to supporting black women heal from sexual trauma and cultivate wholeness with @thebodyahomeforlove. ‚Å£‚Å£

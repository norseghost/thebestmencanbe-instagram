#google conservative employee exposes Google for not liking anyone who is a free thinker online that does not stand with them against conservatives and christians. I have also, been subject to this through social media where I was blocked on both @betoorourke and @berniesanders page. No cursing or threats. Just giving my views and debating with there supporter's. They are censoring people online and do not want conservative or Christian views. For a long time government has done everything to divide people and still are. People need to come together and talk. If a liberal has rights then conservatives have a right too. We are all one in this nation. âœŠðŸ‡±ðŸ‡·

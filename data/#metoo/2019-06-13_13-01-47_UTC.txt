Great to be at last night's Rough Trade hosted discussion between @emmy_the_great @poppyajudha and @alisonmoyetofficial at the launch of A Seat at the Table, Interviews with Women on the Frontline of Music by Amy Raphael, brilliant author of Never Mind the Bollocks: Women Rewrite Rock.
Looking forward to reading these terrific women's interviews among others who "work in the music industry about learning to speak out, #metoo social media, queer politics and the subtleness of everyday misogyny.

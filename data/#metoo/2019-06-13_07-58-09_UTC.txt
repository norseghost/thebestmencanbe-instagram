Episode 1: The Consequences of saying #MeToo in Africa.This episode delves into some of the consequences of speaking up against sexual abuse/violence in many parts of Africa. Despite the wake of the #metoo and #timesup movements in the west, it seems to be a different conversation here on the continent. My guests and I unpack the expensive costs of saying “me too” and “times up” in Africa from the perspective of race, digitalisation and culture. We talk about normalisation of deviant behaviour in our culture, the stigma of  sexual abuse, how we as women also contribute to misogyny and patriarchy and how to approach allyship with men.  If you have ever asked why a sexual assault victim takes so long to speak out, you’ll take away plenty perspective from this episode. Out tomorrow at noon WAT. #SexualViolence #SexualAbuse #Misogyny #patriarchy @eaarmah @akosua7 @alldenslane

1 in 4 women will have an abortion by age 45. This doesn’t even include other genders who get abortions. 
Statistically, we all know and care about someone who has had an abortion. Pregnancy isn’t uncommon, but the desire for one at the right time, financial state, and emotional place is rarer. Without this freedom, there are no choices.

To be anti-choice is to say you believe those you know and love should have been forced into a different path against their will.  Communities need abortion freedom. ✊🏽✊✊🏻✊🏿

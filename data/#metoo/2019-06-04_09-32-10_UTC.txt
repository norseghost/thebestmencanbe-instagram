Read~
I command you, open your eyes and see
what she does is legendary 
Take off the deafness and hear
the triumph and the cheer
She got guts, she got glory
She got a special chapter in this story.
You say, he rules today
I say, she will rule tomorrow
You tell, she is just the backup
I say, enough, Times Up!
Her story isn't just about a cub
She is a wolf, she ain't a runners up!
You said she is history
I say it's 'herstory'
'cause you won't get the winner's cup
'cause it's enough, Times Up 
She is so perfect as complete 
Even her flaws won't take defeat
There will be legends next time
Singing the women's rhyme
Who will remember just as now we do
There wasn't just Adam, there was Eve too!
It's enough, let's bring it to an end, step up
They have had enough, Times Up.

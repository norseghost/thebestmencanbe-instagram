On countless occasions stories of abuse of BOTH MEN & WOMEN have been shared. Many have responded by saying, “What did they do before they got hit?” As if to imply that someone’s words or actions gave the abuser the right to put hands on them. These people need to re-evaluate their way of thinking because no one has the right to abuse anyone regardless of wether the abuser felt provoked or not. Defending abusers because they are family, friends, co-workers etc makes you a part of the problem. Nothing is more painful to a victim of abuse than bystanders that turn a blind eye to the abuse and or blame the victim for contacting the authorities due to them being in fear for their lives. It just adds insult to injury. If you are a survivor of verbal, mental, spiritual, financial, emotional or physical abuse I pray that God gives you a way of escape. And I hope the ppl that make excuses for your abuser opens their eyes and shows support and compassion.  #womenempowerment #enddomesticviolence #wordsofwisdom #womenbeatersarepunks #abusenomore #metoo #domesticabusesurvivor #narcissisticabuse #gaslighting #stophumantrafficking #dontcomeforme #ihitback #womensrights #respectwomen #staystrong #rehabtime #bebold #shareyourstory #womenoffaith #womanofgod #rapesurvivor #stillstanding #unstoppable #loveyourself #keishasworld

Reading this make my stomach turn and my blood boil. It does not surprise me that shady things go on behind the scenes at @wwe but this is far worse then shady and Vince McMahon should be ashamed of himself. If @ashleymassaro was his daughter he would never have asked for her to keep quiet for the sake of 'the relationship' the company had built with the troops. He would have moved heaven and earth to make sure those involved were punished. But @ashleymassaro wasn't his precious daughter @stephaniemcmahon so he saw no problem keeping quiet for the sake of money, promotions and popularity. It is absolutely disgusting! Whether you are a wrestling fan or not I urge everyone to read this and spread the word as Vincent Kennedy McMahon is not the only businessman that would sell you down the river to make a quick buck and brush your trauma under the carpet to save face. What happened to this woman back then is vile and instead of fighting for her she got nothing, no therapy, absolutely nothing. Fast forward to right now and her 18 year old daughter is without a mother due to Ashley Massaro's suicide. Her death was a shock and very sad and now reading this affidavit from her case against @wwe has shown the hell she went through whilst with the company so many of us grew up watching. This is such a shame and all involved with this situation at @wwe should be ashamed, disgusted and embarrassed by their action!!! My thoughts, prayer and love are with her family. #RIP #ashleymassaro #justiceforashley #affidavits #metoo #wwe #vincemcmahon #troops #coverup #tripleh #stephaniemcmahonhelmsley #wweraw #wwesmackdown #disgusting #disgraceful #moneyhungry #anythingtomakemrmcmahonlookgood #noloyalty #nocare #restinpeaceashley #takeresposibilityvince (I'm fuming having this affidavit, honestly enraged for this poor woman.

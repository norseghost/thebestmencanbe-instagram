In honor of our Worth and Pride Month we are finally ready to share our side of the story with my father Tom Bulleit. My opinion that Tom Bulleit is homophobic has not changed and has only deepened since I first publically posted on Facebook about my relationship with him in July 2017. I have suffered almost a half a century of abuse by this man. I have a detailed post on my Facebook page that covers the subjects of homophobia, #metoo, my right to equal pay, and the silencing of my role in the history of family bourbon.

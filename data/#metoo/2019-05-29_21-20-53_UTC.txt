Beautifully framed by @ilanalobetframingstudio (A powder white hand-finished wash on a maple wood box frame, with strainer, Optium Museum Plexi, and hand prepared spacers made of archival museum board). Truly an honor to work with such a professional. She is an artist. The lovely crate was built by @normme Unfortunately for me I will not be able to come West due to a back injury.  The Opening Reception is June 2nd 4-7pm at the Bendix Building 1206 Maple Ave SHOW RUN June 3-12th 1-7pm @everywomanbiennial The EVERY WOMAN BIENNIAL is the all woman and women-identified art biennial founded and curated by C.

I wanted to share this with you today, thinking of our youth day ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ and the combination of Youth Day and Fatherâ€™s Day in South Africa, it had me thinking...how can we impact the future of our youth today? Tackling social ills, the trauma of the past, breaking the curse of our history, particularly in black families. I think that the issues of psychological health impacted by childhood trauma and experiences, influence the adult the child becomes. .
.
Looking at the escalating cases of domestic violence and absent fathers (62% in South Africa), and the appalling stats that 1 in 6 women are sexually assaulted regularly. How does this affect children, building better nations  and reducing the effects of trauma in our society starting in the home. This song is my response and call to action!

Happy Youth Day and Fatherâ€™s Day To You South Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦...

I was around 5 my mother got my sister who was 8 a new dress. My mother told her, \"she was too fat to wear that dress.\" At the time, I didn't understand that this abuse as this was considered \"normal\" at our home.\n\nI had no idea how much this impacted my life and my overall body image and self confidence, until I got older. I tied in my whole self worth with my weight.\u00a0 This was the start of a 15 year battle with an eating disorder. Everytime I would gain weight my mother would say belittling degrading backhanded comments like \"you're getting fat\" or \"you have cellulite on your arms\". \u2606\n\nIt was after my spiritual awakening that I realized my eating disorder was a result of my childhood wounds. When I started loving myself the love for my abusers stopped. It took me a long time to realize I was being abused by both my mother and father who are both narcissits. \u2606\n\nHaving a child does not give one ownership. Children are not possessions to fulfill our own desires. When a mother makes her child a forever servant to meet her own expectations of love and acceptance, she is not a good mother.\n\nSadly, most of these love starved children will go on to procreate for the same reason their bad mother does. Very, very FEW children will be strong enough to be loving people despite the lack of love they received. For the bad mother, this makes them wiser than you. This wisdom is what a true mother teaches & instills in her child. This wisdom makes the bad mother resent the child. It's because of her example, the child learned how not to be her.\n\nI AM proud to say that I was able to find that love within myself despite not being shown any love. Remember respect is earned,\u00a0not given. Just because they are our parents doesn't give them control and dictatorship over our lives. I am sharing my farewell letter to my parents, along with other personal experiences on my blog link is in the bio. I aim to use what I've learned from my past experiences to be a beakon of light and love for others.\n\nNamaste ~ Paulina \ud83d\ude4f"

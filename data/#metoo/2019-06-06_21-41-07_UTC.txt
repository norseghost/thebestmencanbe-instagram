It’s been a very very hard few weeks. Arguments and fall outs with family are not something I anticipated happening. It all seems to have exploded since I’ve gone to the police. Years of upset now coming out. I’m not at all saying I’m not responsible for some of the upset but a little gut wrenching with those who you thought were reliable turn their backs and don’t want to know. I’m plodding along...... just. 
A dear friend bought me this book today and I love it so so much. Was such a thoughtful gift  and something I will treasure. I’ve wanted to bullet journal for ages.... I’ve just not had the time to be so creative and make up pages and pages. I’m living this one already made up! Day one filled in and can’t wait for the rest of the year!!! .

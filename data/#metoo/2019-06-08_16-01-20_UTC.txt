HELP MAKE STRANGULATION A FELONY AND STEP PARENTS PROTECTED UNDER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS IN EVERY STATE!

Her not doing jail time and inadvertently paying for what she did through the California Victims of Violent Crime in her mind says she didn't do it. Anyone who puts their hands on your neck in anger is saying I want to kill you. This happens way more than any of us realize. In my circumstance the woman was the size of a large man 6ft 180lbs. I like other woman could not defend myself luckily my husband was there to save my life but this act of violence never leaves you. I've been given insight into how sick and disturbed a human brain can become. Anyone who acts on urges that result in almost murdering another person needs serious help. It's not normal. Report it!! I did she was convicted but prosecution still has a hard time because there little physical evidence and the courts are not evolving fast enough to appreciate how devastating this is to our lives.

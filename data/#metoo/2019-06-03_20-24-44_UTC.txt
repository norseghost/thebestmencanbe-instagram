So, I shared this post on social media a few months ago because when I initially saw it, I cracked up laughing. It was created with humor and is quite accurate. But what people who don’t have ADHD don’t see is the other side of having a neuro-developmental disorder. It’s the part of your brain that is in pain while this process is happening. You see me laughing it off, but my head is pounding and my chest hurts. Even after having fun with friends, sometimes I will sit in my car and cry. I email my therapist or consider upping my medication because of over-speaking, interrupting people, not picking up on social cues or just not reading the room right. So, if you have a quirky friend or if you are that person who also sometimes “just doesn’t get it”, I understand. Me too, pal.

The distance is palpable
 the space between us created by your hateful ways 
you tell me it’s a misunderstanding 
I’m overreacting 
it’s not what you meant 
then why the act if I may ask 
Why must you run so far to say these so called misunderstandings 
why do you sharpen your knife so meticulously before you plunge it into my chest 
The pain and lies have gone too far 
I’ve been trying for so long to hold these pieces together 
you’ve tied every limb of mine to four horses
They’ve been running as fast as they can
For as long as they can 
Yet I’ve refused to snap 
Ive refuse to let us break 
but now I am tired 
sweat dripping from my face 
every muscle ready to give way
hopelessly truly 
you’ve done this to me so please hold your blame well I take a step back 
Please stable the horses and hold my rope now I need some time 
I’ve hold your hand while you’ve turned your back on me ten times over 
I’m sorry baby but I think now it’s my turn

Meet @ishikawa_yumi.official, the woman who started Japan’s #KuToo movement that sparked thousands to say no to mandatory high heels for women at work. Ishikawa tweeted in January about how she had to stand for hours in the black high heels she was required to wear for her work as an attendant at a funeral home in Tokyo, and the tweet went viral. A movement was born: #KuToo – a combination of the words kutsu (shoe), kutsuu (pain) and the #MeToo hashtag, became a hot topic in Japanese media and on social media. Her online petition calling on the government to ban companies from requiring women to wear high heels in the workplace garnered more than 18,000 signatures. "This is just the first step," the 32-year-old actress and writer after submitting the petition to the labor ministry. #KuToo運動 #genderdiscrimination #japan

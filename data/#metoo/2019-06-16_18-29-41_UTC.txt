This is actually a bit of a difficult day for me to celebrate. Both of my kids grew up without their father actually stepping up or being a leader for them. I spent almost 15 years playing the role of mother and father in my home. I am in no way capable of showing a boy how to be a man, so of course you can imagine how difficult this must have been. My brother stepped in as much as he could, and if it wasn't for him, I don't know where we would be. I'm so thankful for you @mattgorgeousborges

But last year I met the man who was always meant to be their father. And he has stepped up more in just 1 year than their real father's have ever in their lifetime. God works in mysterious ways. God had this planned before it happened. He had a father chosen for these boys long before we even met him. I believe he was always meant to be their father, and he fit into that role so naturally. I love how God works and how He answers prayers to fulfill all of our needs. .

My relationship with my dad was great when I was a kid. After my parents split, I confess, my father wasn't there for me. But God is in the business of restoration and redemption. And today, I'm happy to say that my father and I have a good relationship. He taught me how to be affectionate, he instilled his sense of humor in me, and he gave me the drive to always do what I love. Happy father's day to the men who step up!

I am a wild woman. There is strength in my blood but not in my silence.
Around this time I would’ve been starting to prepare an announcement to let you know that we were expecting, but the universe had other plans for us as it usually does. At around 8 weeks we found out the pregnancy was not viable. It was, of course, devastating news.  Instead of waiting for a natural miscarriage to occur I decided to take Misoprostol, the drug that forces an abortion. It was the most physically and emotionally painful experience of my life thus far. The grief surrounding this loss has been unexpected, unfamiliar and just plain tough.
.
Why do I tell you this?
Because the only thing that has comforted me during this past month of grief was knowing other women’s stories, knowing how common this was within my community of sisters.
.
Why do I tell you this?
To break down the shame and stigma around one of the most common occurrences women have. 
It makes my heart hurt too much to know that most women are suffering in silence.
.
Why do I tell you this?
We all know what the climate is like around our reproductive systems currently. 
We must be vocal and let our experiences and beliefs be known.
We are in charge of our own bodies.
.
Maybe sharing this is a part of my healing journey. Maybe I know and feel the suffering of my sisters behind closed doors. If this can comfort just one person it was worth it.  Sharing some wide open venerability in this plastic non reality social media forum.
.
I’m not ashamed. My body is strong. Our bodies are strong.
We are the life giving force. I will not be silent in my grief.
We shall not be silent.

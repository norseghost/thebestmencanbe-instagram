It takes courage to do what is right. It takes an immense amount of courage to share your trauma especially when so many others have been permanently silenced. We have a responsibility to commemorate those who have lost their lives due to MST. Their families deserve to heal. Along the way, we have met so many others who have experienced our deep rooted pain. 
Sign our petition to commemorate the fallen due to MST.

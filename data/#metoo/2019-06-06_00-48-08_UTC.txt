GL🌎BAL RUNNING DAY!!!
.
I didn’t know how much this day would mean to me. I didn’t even know it existed until ... today. 😂
.
I really started running in high school. Back then it was about being thin. I ran in my freshman year of college. Back then it was about being thin.
.
And then, my sophomore year of college, shit hit the fan. I endured some devastating stuff. Some stuff I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I found freedom in running and I found grace in running.
.
Four years after that, I’d experience a breakup that led me to say “fuck it” and sign up for a half marathon. 🤷🏼‍♀️ And seriously ... the rest is history 😂
.
Since then, I’ve been running. And since then, it’s been about freedom. Power. Some control. Balance. Love. Grit. Determination. Perseverance. Integrity.
.
No one is stalking your workouts making sure you do it all. No one is there to cheer you on in the heat of summer during your threshold run. No one is holding a finish line tape at the end of a long run. It’s just you. YOU have to motivate yourself. YOU have to find something within yourself that pushes onward.
.
Running gave me freedom when I felt trapped and when I was buried. It gave me something to look forward to. Something to remind my body that I can do hard things. I can do things people say I can’t. I can push myself to my limits and passed what I ever imagined they’d be.
.
Running has evolved for me so many times that I truly can’t fathom it or explain it all.
.
I am so grateful for this sport. Happy running day, fam. 💖

Commemorating #MemorialDayWeekend we speak with @cbstv @sealteamcbs 📺Actress @tonitrucks who talks to us about what she learned about the Military in her portrayal, the gratitude for those who serve this country & a deeper understanding of the trials and tribulations they face. We love the show and are honored by those who served in the Military. 👏🏾 🇺🇸 #MemorialDay #UnitedStates #ArmedForces #InHonor #Army #Marine #AirForce #Marine #Navy #CBS #Actress #ToniTrucks

Pride, black lives matter, me too, are all current organizations/movements to uplift recognize and bring awareness to the persecuted and marginalized within our society. Not to say they are more important than others, but that they are just as important. Many within our society will never experience hate and bigotry for just being who you are, but that does not negate you from showing love, inclusion and support for your fellow humans that deserve social justice, equality, acceptance and the same treatment and human rights as the “majority” or what society deems “normal”. May we all strive to support organizations and movements that uplift total equality, diversity, unity, acceptance and inclusion of all. Let’s start viewing the world from another’s perspective. I’m cheering for  all of us to be the best version of ourselves that we can be.

“When I met you, you were a girl. Now you’ve become a woman”
.
His idea of a woman is my idea of a floor mop: flaccid, wet, and inoffensive. Useful for running across floors. Someone who never speaks in anger, never refuses a request, and always does the laundry on time
.
He would use words like “soft” “fuller,” “tender”
.
But there is nothing soft about fire
.
There is a story in the Hindu sacred texts about Sita, wife of the god, Rama. They were exiled in the wilderness for 14 years with Rama’s brother, Lakshman. Ravana, king of the demons, was bent on kidnapping Sita. Lakshman drew a protective circle around Sita to keep her safe, but Sita was lured out by a golden deer (who turned out to be a demon in disguise)
.
I don’t want to be safe; I want the golden deer
.
I want the apple. I want the whole damn tree and Adam can go find his own
.
All my life people having been drawing circles around me and I will not stay and sit any longer. There is so much more I want to experience than this small circle of “acceptable” that you have placed around me
.
Rama eventually rescues Sita, but believes that she has been unfaithful. To prove her innocence, Sita walks through a fire and the flames refuse to burn her
.
Can I just ask: what the fuck is wrong with us that one of the gods we worship would treat his kidnapped wife that way?
.
I will not immolate myself to protect any male ego. I have walked through many fires and all of them have burned me and all I can do is run faster, harder, and longer but I will. not. stop.

I got to go to an art class tonight and try Kintsugi for the first time itâ€™s an old Japanese tradition where you take something broken and fill it with gold and make it beautiful agin, you had to first brake your bowl and for some people it only took one time to brake others it took a few time but no ones way was wrong. For me it was such a healing experience it took me the hole class time to finish it took a lot of patients it reminded me to stay patient with myself. The stuff I have been through has not been easy but it made me me and I would not change my struggles for anything #metoo #metoomovement #broken #healed #loveit #scarsdontdefineme #scarsarebeautifulproject #madememe #loveyourself #japenese #japenesetradition

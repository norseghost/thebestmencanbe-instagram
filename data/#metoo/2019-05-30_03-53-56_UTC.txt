"PRICELESS JOY"
I would not trade my smile or joy for a million dollars...for one this is a million dollar smile but my joy is priceless 🙏
My trauma has fully vested into my healing which in turn has given me wholeness.  I live a life that I could have only imagined after being a victim of rape, sexual abuse, bullying and so much more.  However my peace surpasses all understanding as I have learned to rest in God.  Resting in HIM has given me joy unspeakable joy that is PRICELESS and a smile that infects all that I encounter to encourage 💛💛💛 #METOO #mentalhealthawareness #loveconquersall #peace #lifecoach #goddesirestohealyou #joy #grateful #ellendegeneres #ibelieveinyou #ibelievesurvivors #istandwithyou #letthehealingbegin #blacklove #blackgirlmagic #blackgirlsrock #SURVIVORSPEAKS #survivor #laviniaspeaks #thelaviniamastersact #laviniasmiles

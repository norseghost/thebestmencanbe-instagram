Which later gave me the courage to become my own boss & copartner with my mentor to launch a media agency\ud83d\udcbb \ud83d\udcfd\n\nWe had several clients but not enough man power so we decided it\u2019s best to close shop for our own sanity (& our pockets \ud83d\udcb8) By 2017 i began managing many bloggers, influencers, & brand accounts as their content creator & social media strategist \ud83d\udcf1 \nJust when I thought I had finally achieved a steady income as an entrepreneur.... my life too a drastic turn! \u26a0\ufe0fTRIGGER WARNING \u26a0\ufe0f I was followed home 1 night after celebrating with coworkers at a concert & a man  deliberately followed me & struck the back of my vehicle \ud83d\ude97  on the freeway \ud83d\udee3 \nI got out to see if everything was okay.\nWhat happened next lead to me running half naked on the road screaming for help. \nI was sexually assaulted, strangled, stripped & robbed \ud83d\udc94\n\nIt was a very horrific year of recovery.\nI chose to take back my power & life by first....\nUnpacking the trauma.\n\nThis lead to 2.5 years of intensive therapy.\n(Still holding strong \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd w/therapy)  I began educating myself on the aftermath of trauma victims & I realized how HUGE this is to the well-being of ones mental & emotional wellness \ud83e\udde0 \nI made a vow to myself that I would turn my \u2022Pain to Purpose \u2022Tragedy to Triumph\n\u2022Mess into a Message\n\u2022Vulnerability into Empathy \u2665\ufe0f\nI appreciate each & everyone of you who have dm me & shared your story with me & I BELIEVE YOU!\nIntroduce yourself \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd I would love to get to know you!"

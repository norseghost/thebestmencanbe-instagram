Shame on you @FairOaksFarms and as for your statement @FairLife - we don’t want you to switch suppliers but to stop selling what was never ours to take as the entire Dairy industry is #AnimalCruelty. 
_
This is why I’m #Vegan. This is why #DairyIsScary. This is why we should all go #DairyFree 💔😭🌱 .
_
#CowsMilk is for calves but as you can see, they are deprived of it, beaten and killed so that we can steal, bottle and sell it. Please choose #PlantBasedMilk and #VeganCheese, #VeganIceCream etc instead. Let’s fix this broken world. #NotYourMomNotYourMilk

The largest ever undercover #Dairy investigation has exposed consistent #AnimalAbuse towards vulnerable #BabyAnimals. 
_
#FairOaksFarms @FairOaksFarms is the largest dairy producer in the U.S. and supplies #DairyProducts to the @FairLife #Milk brand - which is produced, marketed and distributed by the @CocaCola Corporation.
_
@ARMInvestigations have confirmed that male #Calves from #FairOaksFarms are in fact transported to #Veal farms (Midwest Veal and Calf Start) despite the corporation's claims that it does not do this.
_
The following abuses were witnessed on virtually a daily basis:
_
Employees were observed slapping, kicking, punching, pushing, throwing and slamming calves; calves were stabbed and beaten with steel bars, hit in the mouth and face with hard plastic milking bottles, kneed in the spine, burned in the face with hot branding irons, subjected to extreme temperatures, provided with improper nutrition and denied medical attention. This resulted in extreme pain and suffering by the calves and in some cases permanent injury and even death.

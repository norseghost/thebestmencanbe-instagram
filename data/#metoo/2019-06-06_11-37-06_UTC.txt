Out of every 1,000 rapes, only 995 perpetrators will serve jail time according to @rainn this is because out of 1,000 rapes, only 230 are reported to the police.  Only 46 of those lead to an arrest. And out of 46 arrests, only nine cases get referred to prosecutors. Of those, only 5 will lead to prosecution, and of those five only 4.6 will lead to imprisonment of any length.

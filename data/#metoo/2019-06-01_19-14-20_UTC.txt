I am outraged! I’m outraged that old men in government are making decisions about female bodies. I’m outraged that global warming is being treated as a joke instead of an imperative issue we should all be able to come together on. I’m outraged the government is trying to write trans people out of existence by enacting a vast amount of discriminatory laws and removing any and all government recognition of even the word transgender. I’m outraged how much my country has been divided. I’m outraged my country is represented by a racist xenophobe. I’m outraged I can no longer respect friends and family who knowingly voted for a president who brags about sexually assaulting women. I could go on but I want to hear from you, why are you outraged?

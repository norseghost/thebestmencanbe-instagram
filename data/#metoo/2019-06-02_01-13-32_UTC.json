                        "text": "\u2728SUPPORTING A SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE\u2728 \nThe first time someone disclosed their sexual abuse to me, I had no idea how to respond. It was scary, and emotional. I wanted to be supportive but I didn\u2019t know how. So for those of us who are still figuring out how to best support those who have experienced sexual violence, here are some quick & easy Do\u2019s and Dont\u2019s of supporting survivors. \u2728DO\u2728\n\u2705Validate their experience - \u201cI believe you\u201d.\n\u2705Tell them that it isn\u2019t their fault & they did nothing to deserve it.\n\u2705Ask how you can be supportive.\n\u2705Remind them that you care about them.\n\u2705LISTEN.\n\u2705Respect their boundaries (ex: ask before hugging)\n\u2705Give them total control of the conversation (how much they share, how long the convo is etc).\n\u2705Reach out for support - you don\u2019t have to support them alone, you may need support too.\n\u2728DON\u2019T\u2728\n\u274cDefine their experience for them - some people do not feel that the words r*pe, sexual assault etc describe their experience for them. Do not force them to use those words.\n\u274cQuestion them - you\u2019re not an investigator, so don\u2019t act like one. \u274cDoubt them - this can cause such further trauma and damage.\n\u274cMinimize their experience - no \u201cat least ___ didn\u2019t happen\u201d. Violence is violence, trauma is trauma. This isn\u2019t a competition. \u274cPush them to report - It\u2019s important that you allow the survivor FULL control over how they cope. They\u2019re coping with how the lost control of their body, so don\u2019t take away their control over how they cope with it. \u274cShare their story without permission.\n\u274cAct like a pro - it\u2019s ok if you\u2019re not.\n\u274cGive unsolicited advice or opinions.\n\u2728Remember: you can only support someone else if you\u2019re taking care of yourself too. If these conversations aren\u2019t possible for you that\u2019s ok, tell the person that you believe and support them and ask if it\u2019s ok that together you find someone who can give them the support you can\u2019t. \n#sexed #sexeducation #sexeducator #rse #sexualassault #metoo #ibelieveyou #believesurvivors #iknowispelledbelievewrong #supportingsurvivors #SARA #sexualassaultsupport #sexualviolence #healthyrelationships #letstalkaboutsex #triggerwarning #howto"

Let's hear from our dancers! 
Can a women renowned for her wisdom, grace, beauty and chastity stand on par with the soul of the fallen king? In the current #metoo climate, one would define the mere consort as a setback to womenhood but as I dug deeper, the queen defines as an unswerving and self-efficacing women who doesn't cow down to society's expectations but is driven by the canons of Dharma, hitched by a thread...the red thread, which emanates from the very core of her being. - Aishwaryaa Kumar,  Dancer -

⚡️⚡️Anthropologie is a brand with collaboration in its DNA, a magical place I got lost in when I first visited NYC in 1997. ✨✨When I launched Future Female in 2017 I could not have imagined we would get to collaborate with Anthropologie, 🌈and have a chance to be a tiny part of that magic. 🌈⚡️💥That 20 something ME in NYC is hysterical with excitement because some part of me knew I would arrive at this place in the future to shout about everyday equality! .

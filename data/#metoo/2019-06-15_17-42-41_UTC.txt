Itâ€™s been 3 years of service. Iâ€™m 3 years weâ€™ve accomplished so much. We e supported over 300 survivors. Mailed over 250+ survivor packs, clothed over 20 women, held over 10 events, held a couple of interviews and inspired countless women. We couldnâ€™t have done this without you! Thank you for your constant support, we are forever grateful and because of you we can service so many more women. If youâ€™d like to donate for our anniversary click the link in the bio! ðŸ¦‹ðŸ’œ

“In her final frustration, she cries out to God or just no one.”
Being an empath in a broken world is an everyday struggle. Trying to separate caring and taking on emotions. So I’m working on some new rough sketches to relieve and release it all. Art is a grounding tool. And right now it has been more for myself than for the sake of showing it. I think that takes the pressure off the work anyway.

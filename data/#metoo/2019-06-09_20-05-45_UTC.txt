The purpose of behind Women of the Culture is to share the experiences, trails, obstacles of women everywhere not just a specific culture. Its about sharing and acknowledging the struggles of women, it’s a way of saying ‘You Are Not Alone.’ We live in a day and age where certain individuals believe that the predicaments their culture faces everyday outweighs the predicaments of another culture, whereas that’s far from it. Being a woman in any country is beyond difficult; we have to work twice as hard from employment to raising children. We struggle through emotional, physical and mental pains and traumatic experiences, but, yet we have the will to keep going even when all hope seems lost. We Keep Going. So the magazine is for Women of the Culture, I want to share your story of survival, I want give a voice to those who may not have. I want to create a platform where women can be heard.

...Although there is no right or wrong way to help a victim of domestic violence, you want to avoid doing anything that will make the situation worse. Here are some "don'ts" the experts suggest you avoid:

Avoid bashing the abuser. Focus on the behavior, not the personality.
Never blame the victim. That's what the abuser does.
Don't underestimate the potential danger for the victim and yourself.
Don't promise any help that you can't follow through with.
Don't give conditional support.
Don't do anything that might provoke the abuser.
Don't pressure the victim.
Don't give up. If she is not willing to open up at first, be patient.
Don't do anything to make it more difficult for the victim. üôèüèæ #mentalabuse #mentalwellness

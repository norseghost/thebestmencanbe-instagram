Not too long ago I was in the kitchen and I noticed I was irritable for no reason. It was getting worse and I wanted to slam the fridge. It didn't make sense. Then I finally heard it, the finger nail clipping. My daughter-in-law was clipping her nails (a big trigger for me), but I didn't hear it. My subconscious heard it though. 
So yeah, triggers are real and we are not faking it.

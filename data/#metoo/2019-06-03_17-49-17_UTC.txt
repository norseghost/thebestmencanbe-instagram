Part 2: “Reports of numerous children, infants even, barely able to take care of themselves, being raped and molested by their fathers, brothers, uncles, extended family members as well as teachers and community and religious leaders make daily news. We have been satisfied with writing a quick “rest in peace” on social media, using hashtags calling for justice and visibility to all these victims, attending vigils, fundraising and endless meetings on how to visit them in hospitals and their families sitting in mourning after putting one more daughter in the ground.  We are not hard on crime because we fail to recognize the full humanity of women and their right to live free from humiliation and violence.

Ethiopian women continue to live their lives in utter denial and equal measure of terror that they or their loved ones will meet the same fate. It is almost as if society has found it acceptable to have women live under such an environment where we survive day to day by the discretion of men and their desire not to harm us. 
Women, after being cautioned against staying out too long after dark, come home to fathers who have assaulted or molested them all their lives; to uncles who they have been told to not be too friendly with; to husbands who beat them senseless over things one would not hit an animal over. Girls who are held back from uncovering their full potential, stay economically and emotionally dependent on their husbands or romantic partners, making it near impossible to speak out or leave when they are abused.

Some who are lucky enough to go to school and pursue their dreams full time are under constant threat of teachers and professors who want a little something for the trouble of having a woman in their classrooms. Others join the workforce but are subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace. The same women catch the eyes of a random stranger on the street, who immediately feel entitled to their bodies, attention and time, demand these women completely submit to his advances lest they want to be insulted, assaulted, or be subject to an acid attack” #MeTooEthiopia #MeToo #Ethiopia #EthiopianWomen

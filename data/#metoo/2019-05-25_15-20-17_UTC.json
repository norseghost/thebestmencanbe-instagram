                        "text": "A small glimpse into my happy place \u2728 \nI\u2019ve loved plants since I was little. Growing up, they always meant time with my dad and my grandma. We\u2019d spend every single weekend planting flowers and trees. Now, plants have a different significance for me (though I still plant flowers every few weeks at my grandma\u2019s!), as they were a huge part of my trauma recovery. I\u2019d spend hours taking care of my plants because I wasn\u2019t taking care of myself. I thought that if something deserved love and care, and I couldn\u2019t take care of me, then I should love my plants. So now I have quite the collection of herbs, Tilly the tomato plant, a succulent garden, and about eight thousand seedlings. Something as \u201csmall\u201d as plants had a huge impact on the way I viewed myself, and they were the catalyst that got me to learn to heal and grow as a person. I\u2019ve also learned that humans are basically houseplants with more complicated emotions! A silly thought, but that was what formed the connection in my damaged mind that I needed to care for myself as I did my plants. I\u2019m incredibly grateful for this realization, as I certainly wouldn\u2019t be the person I am right now \u2728\n\n#journeytominimalism #findingme #behappy #namaste #patience #findingme #metoo #alive #happytobehere #nofilter #zerowastehome #zerowaste #zerowasteliving #tomato #tomatoplant #tinyfriends  #backtotheroots #ourplanetourhome #plasticfree #plasticfreeliving #crazyplantlady #iloveplants #natureitsalloverme #vegan #succulents #cactus"

I am not about restricting myself. I believe that a healthy lifestyle means getting to enjoy a wide range of foods that feed my body with the nutrients it craves -- AND taste good. ⠀

As long as you’re focusing on healthy foods, I personally don’t restrict my portions. I just eat until I’m full, and then stop. ⠀

So yes! I eat some carbs in moderation… healthy breads, pastas, and sweet potatoes… I just make sure that they’re organic have no gluten, no refined flour or sugar and only have nutrients that are good for my body. Read those labels! Or better yet, make it yourself if you have a little extra time. Homemade is the best. ⠀

My daughter is the master at finding all sorts of delicious recipes and creating her own that are good for your body and not full of harmful ingredients. ⠀

A few of my favorite places for finding new recipes are on Pinterest, Instagram and healthy websites.

Ellen recently opened up again about being sexually abused. This time she gave more details and confirmed what we already know, most children are molested by the people they know; Ellen’s abuser was her stepfather.
In a previous interview on her show, Ellen had talked about how vulnerable and trusting kids are. She even talked about “feeling stupid” for being victimized, and how as a survivor you think you could’ve controlled what happened, but you couldn’t.
No child is a match for these masters of manipulation, not a 5 year old or in Ellen’s case, a 15 year old. This man used her mother’s illness to convince her that his actions were medically necessary. Imagine being a kid whose mother has been battling with breast cancer and someone you trust tells you they need to examine you because they want to make sure you don’t have cancer too. Even if the concept seems off in your mind, as a child, the idea that someone you love and trust would use something so serious to hurt you would seem preposterous.
Ellen says she didn’t tell right away because like many kids, she was trying to protect her mother. When she finally did disclose the abuse, her mother didn’t believe her.
We talk about these things because they are happening everyday to kids of all ages and from all races, socioeconomic, cultural, and religious backgrounds. These predators know no limits. Therefore, we need to arm ourselves and our children. And most importantly, believe them! 
We have to start taking this issue seriously!!! #childsexabuseawareness #stopchildsexabuse #childsexabusesurvivor #parentsofchilldsexabusesurvivor #sexualassault #endchildsexabuse #endrapeculture #childabuse #sextrafficking #atlanta #ATL #Georgia #church #girls #teens #awareness #rapevictim #victim #children #prevention #trafficking  #survivor #tips #blogger #speaker #metoo #advocate #volunteer  #socialmedia article: @theshaderoom

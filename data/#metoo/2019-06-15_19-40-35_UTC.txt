Compartmentalizing parts of ourselves to avoid vulnerability, the shadow and/or the fear of not belonging will only work for a while. The disconnection is the illusion. Every experience must be acknowledged, honored and integrated into the whole and remarkable presence of you. Own your story, or they will create one for you. Use it. Redirect it for good. #lifecoach #awareness #selflove #forgiveness #evolution #integration #connection #ownit #metoo #losangeles #confidence #magic #leadershipcoaching #siliconvalley

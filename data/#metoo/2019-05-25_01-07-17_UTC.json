The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares.\n--Henri Nouwen\n__________\n.\nToday I am thankful for my (very few) close friends and especially @practisewithjen, my yoga bff. How rare it is to find someone who practices not only the same style of yoga, but with the same teacher, who found Iyengar yoga the same way I did (through injury), who shares similar thoughts on MPY (modern postural yoga) and perspectives on cultural appropriation, privilege, racism, classism/elitism, body positivity and feminism/#metoo... AND not only that, is also a yoga teacher herself. .\n.\nMy heart is extra happy if I know she's gonna be there. Practising with someone you know by your side is great -- although for awhile we would purposely stay on opposite sides of the room cos we (she\ud83e\udd23) was cautious about both of us (me) laughing too loudly together at something our teacher might say.\n.\nDo you like to go to yoga class with a friend or partner? Or do you see it as your personal time and prefer it a solitary space?\n\nImage: Female Ascetics (Yoginis) \nIndia, Rajasthan, Bikaner, circa 1730-1740"

It is with great heartache that I share this update.

Maleah Davis should still be here and had her mother put her child's needs first and #cowardexposed this predator it is highly possible that Maleah would still be here.

We as a society need to work together to #cowardexposed the child abusers and predators living within our own communities.

Together we can protect a child and change a community.... Continue to run freely and play in Heaven's playground Maleah you are loved and missed... #Faith

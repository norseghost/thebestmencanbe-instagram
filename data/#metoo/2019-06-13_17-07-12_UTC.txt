June is PTSD Awareness Month. This is a piece I wrote a few years ago. My PTSD has been spiraling these last few months which has made it hard to write new pieces, so I'm going to share some old ones that mean a lot to me. .

So here it is......
.
Lately I've been getting some flack from people when I tell them that I slept till 11 or 12 or if I tell them I have to have a nap. I wish those people could see the rapid speed in which my mind races at 2am. Especially when I'm stressed out as much as I have been these last few weeks.
.
There's something about the deafening silence of the night that decideds to tango with every thought racing through my mind. As much as I try to cease this dance my mind insists on being in, the music changes; my thoughts are thrown into a quickstep and I am left with no other choice than to continue to sway with the silence of the night. There is literally no amount of sleep that can help when your whole body feels like it's 1000lbs and refuses to work properly. It's a battle just to get the energy to get out of bed a eat something. Think of how exhausted your body feels after you've pushed yourself to do something extremely physical, something that made every muscle in your body ache to the point that moving causes  extreme pain. That's how I feel most days. My muscles are in a constant state of fight or flight, So when you add extreme stress on top of that the pain is unbearable. Couple that with the fact that when your Bipolar your nerves are also hypersensitive and physically feel pain more than other people. It's excruciating some days. .
So please, the next time you think I (or anyone suffering from Mental illness) am being lazy please try to understand just how hard it is for us to just be awake some days. I'm so thankful to have someone by my side who understands that some days 'Just living' is all I have the energy for. ‚ù§

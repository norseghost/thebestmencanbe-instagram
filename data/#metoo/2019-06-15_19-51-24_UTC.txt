“why is it you keep making the same poor choices over and over again? Why do relationships in your life suffer because of poor communication? Why do you sometimes feel as though you have no control in your life? It could be because your inner child is in the driver's seat, and if you've ever seen a six-year-old drive, well, that says it all. Our inner child is part of us--actually it is us at one point in our life. But even though we grow up physically, a part of us still remains that child. This can be good in terms of play, fun, and just looking at life with the wonder of a child, but when our little inner child is in the driver's seat making life decisions that children have no business making, that's a whole other story. Fear, anger, and jealousy are just a few of the simple ways our inner child can sabotage us without meaning to. Addiction and other dangerous behaviors are some of the more serious issues attributed to allowing the inner child to make adult decisions. Once you can identify whether or not your inner child is in charge, you can begin to change the behavior and patterns that are keeping you from creating the life and relationships you want and deserve” via @dailyom .

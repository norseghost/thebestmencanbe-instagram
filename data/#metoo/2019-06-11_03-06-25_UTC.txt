These are the words to help you heal. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Feel the air fill your lungs, and feel it rush out. Can you hear your heartbeat? Can you feel your breath? Do you see how alive you are? Your heart is still beating, and you are still breathing. You’re not broken, you’re just hurting right now – and it’s ok to hurt. It’s ok to feel. Letting yourself feel is the first step in healing. Letting yourself feel is how you learn, and let go, and begin again.  #survivors #sexualassault#metoo #healing#awareness#ptsd #narcissist #sexualassault #believesurvivors ##survivors#metoo #healing#awareness#ptsd #sexualassault #believesurvivors #love #rapevictim #endabuse #mentoo

Japan’s health and labour minister defended workplaces that require women to wear high heels to work, saying it's “necessary and appropriate.”
.
A group of women who want the government to ban workplaces from requiring female jobseekers and employees to wear high heels started a petition to overturn the rule. .
The campaign is dubbed �#KuToo, a play on words from the Japanese word “kutsu”, meaning shoes, and “kutsuu”, meaning “pain”. It is also a reference to the global �#MeToo movement against sexual abuse.

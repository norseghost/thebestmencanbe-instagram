He recognized it pretty quickly and we were able to identify some ways to endure, until it is possible to safely exit.\nA scapegoat is typically the one who needs to examine or reconcile the matter.  RATS \ud83d\ude21  I forgot to add \u201cdisconnection\u201d to my graphic- that shitty feeling of separation from others, ourselves, and #reality \u2620\ufe0f \u2022\u2022 My son readily related the example of my relatives gathering with his father and his brother and without me\u2014 and everyone behaving as if I do not exist \u2014 the unspoken rule to not mention me or things that relate to me.\u00a0\u00a0He articulated a pretty sophisticated understanding of these politics. This led us straight into a discussion about how assertions by \u201cthe invisible army\u201d are intended to quiet us from sharing honestly. \nI shared my experience of how the \ud83d\udc18 has consistently been a symptom of sick relationships\u2014 in which one or more people are addicts and/or abusers, requiring complicit denial of a thing, event, or person.\u00a0\u00a0The threat of truth speaking or having feelings is real. \u27a1\ufe0fThe room with the \ud83d\udc18 is the least safe place for truth speakers and deep feelers. #elephantintheroom #empath #thestruggleisreal #beware \ud83e\udd10\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude4a #rapeculture #rape #metoo #invisiblearmy  #alcoholic #culture"

The most FREEING thing you can do is share your story so it is no longer a WEIGHT in your life. |

I however am doing it on a larger platform than most but Iâ€™ve been lead by the MOST HIGH to share my story.

With it being mental health awareness month I didnâ€™t want the month to come to an end without me talking about the past 6 months of healing I just went through. |

But please understand I donâ€™t want your sympathy but rather I want to build other women and men up who have gone through anything that may be weighing them down. |

I AM NOT BROKEN. I AM NOT A VICTIM. |

I AM EMPOWERED AND BLESSED BEYOND BELIEF BY THE MOST HIGH. |

My DMâ€™s are open to anyone who may feel alone or need someone whoâ€™s been in their shoes to not look at them in pity but be there to provide strength and encouragement. |

Simply put, I SEE you, I HEAR you, I BELIEVE you. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. |

Video is coming Wednesday on my YouTube channel and the link to my channel is in my bio. |

Peace, Love, & Happiness ðŸ’•

Cuba Gooding Jr. flashed a wide smile as he left court in New York on Thursday after being released from police custody.
The Jerry Maguire star, 51, was arraigned and charged with forcible touching and sexual abuse in the third degree. He pleaded not guilty to both.
When questioned by reporters, Gooding did not comment on the allegations brought against him, but instead sent well wishes to Boston Red Sox star David Ortiz, who was recently shot in the Dominican Republic, the Associated Press reported.

‚è∞ Time's Up ‚è∞‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
Philip Green has been charged with four counts of misdemeanor assault in Arizona. He allegedly repeatedly inappropriately touched a fitness instructor. ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
This is the man who already paid women off who worked for him because he sexually assaulted them. It ranged from inappropriate behaviour, groping and grabbing to putting a female employee in a headlock! He also had to pay off an employee for racially abusing him, so not only is he a sex pest he's a racist too just to put some context out there.‚Å£ ‚Å£‚Å£
You'll notice I left his 'Sir' title off; because it holds as much significance  as the loose mint in the bottom of my bag. ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
Philip, you may not see prison but we see you for what you are, we've always seen you for what you are and now your time is up! ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£

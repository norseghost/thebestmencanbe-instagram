It’s no secret that Hollywood is home to conspiracies that are affiliated with pedophile sex rings and satanic cults. Former child star #CoreyFeldman made controversial headlines when he came out and stated that him and his long time friend #CoreyHaim were molested by Hollywood insiders as children. A documentary directed by Feldman was in the works as well. The film analyzes how common pedophilia is in the entertainment industry and exposes A-list celebrities for being sexual predators. The film was never released. Feldman along with other child star actors such as #ElijahWood, have spoken out about sex rings in Hollywood that prey on young children. Elijah Wood shared his thoughts on the subject in an interview by saying, “Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized. There are a lot of vipers in this industry, people who only have their own interests in mind," he said. "There is darkness in the underbelly. What bums me about these situations is that the victims can't speak as loudly as the people in power. That's the tragedy of attempting to reveal what is happening to innocent people: they can be squashed, but their lives have been irreparably damaged” (Hollywood). When the #metoomovement broke out, individuals were bringing an old 2011 @abcnetwork interview of Feldman  trying to expose Hollywood pedophiles back into the media light. Many of the sexual predators that Feldman named in the interview have not  been prosecuted yet. 
How many more victims need to be sexually abused in order for there to be an actual change?

Hey everybody! We are excited to see all of you at our event put on with Me Too Springfield! 
We just had a few rules to go over with everyone. 
1. NO MINORS WHATSOEVER. 18 and older only. Must bring photo ID
2. Limit one per person
3. We cannot tattoo fingers, hands, ribs (including under and sideboob), hips, inner lips, necks, or faces. 
4. Cut off time is at 7, if you are not there by then , you must book an appointment for a different day.
.
Due to the high volume of responses there will be a one tattoo per person limit on June 3rd. We understand that there are people who want more than one. If you are unable to make the time cut off,  want multiple, or that day just doesn't work, you can also schedule with Brittany Sue Tattoo. You can find her on Facebook, Instagram, and the Inkspiration Facebook page. She is the only artist tattooing these designs outside of the event. The donation will still apply to your tattoo outside of the event. Nobody is getting left out üòÅ
.
Just a friendly reminder that your artist is a person and not a machine ‚ù§ Be patient and mindful of the process. Your artist is there to help and show support! This event is for awareness and charity so treat it as such. Also, please be nice to our helpers that day! They will be there to help you while we tattoo and answer as many questions as they can.
$40 for the outline, $50 if you want it shaded, $60 if you want it colored. 50% is donated to Me Too Springfield. 
See ya then!

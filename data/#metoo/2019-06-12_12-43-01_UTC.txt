Swipe➡️ Rp @christine_the_vegan A last minute protest organized with about 24 hrs notice. 19 activists came together to oppose @cocacola 's partnership with @fairoaksfarms @fairlife - the farm that had recent undercover footage released, showing consistent abuse towards newborn calves. Calves were beaten, stabbed, burned, thrown, kicked.. no compassion shown towards these soft, gentle, sentient creatures. 
It's important to note that the dairy industry cannot exist without exploitation. It doesn't matter if it's a small time farm or a large farm like this. It doesn't matter how "nicely" we exploit animals. They are not ours to use. Their maternal lactations are not ours to take. Please ditch dairy.

.
Earlier the prophecy told 
The hidden secrets unfold 
The end of man's reign 
woman will rebuilt this empire again .

Women will speak for themselves 
The crowd will not longer stay deaf 
Men's wisdom won't work anymore 
It is a mere beginning of gender war .

The woman whose heart you have broken 
Her avenge will be taken 
You will feel the same pain 
The history will repeat itself again .

Karma is a bitch 
And time and destiny take it's advantage 
What you will do will eventually come back to you 
The ancient avenge will continue .

No I am not an anti-man 
I am just another woman deceived by a man .

@buzzfeed I want nothing to do with this experience. 
I was told that I could not have my tubes tied until I was 35 or had three  children. 
Due to the fact that doctors/government/insurance  has control over my body, choices, and direction of life. 
Funding for family planning is getting cut. 
Birth control  is the hardest it has ever been to access. 
If we do not want abortions to be used as a form of birth control, then make family planning a top priority. 
Birth control should be free, no age  restrictions 
Plan B pills should be free, no age restrictions.
Condoms should be free , no age  restrictions  Vasectomy  Should be free ( LOW cost), no age  restrictions 
Tubal litigation Should be free(LOW cost), no age  restrictions 
GiVE US OUR CHOICE FOR FAMILY PLANNING FOR MEN AND WOMEN

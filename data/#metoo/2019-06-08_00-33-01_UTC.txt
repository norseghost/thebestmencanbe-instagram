When I was 1st sexually assaulted I was 13. 13 and thinking nobody would touch me in such a way when knowing I was with someone at the time. I was SOOOO wrong about that. Having to run home crying, Painful butterflies in my stomach feeling dirty of having no control on what just happened. Having to tell my boyfriend at the time and my parents was nerve wrecking but I knew I had to tell someone. 
The second time it happened a teacher went with me to the police station to report. They didn't do anything but charge him with sexual assault. I had a different boyfriend at that time and he still holds that grudge even though we aren't together anymore. I have never felt more disgusted at my abuser than I already have. 
For people that have been abused you're not alone. There are people to reach out to even though it feels you've lost it all.

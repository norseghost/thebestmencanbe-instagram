I just got really offended. Searching for good stuff to repost for y’all & this comes up. Men can be victims too!!!! WTF?!? I know that the statistics state that men are more often abusers, but that doesn’t change the fact that there are some nasty bitches out there hurting men, or men hurting each other! Instagram, do you really think this is helpful? What am I missing? Is this supposed to be supporting #metoo ? Men are raped too!! What the hell?!? No wonder there’s so much shame for men to speak out. Damn. #endrant #abuse #domesticviolence #victim #victimblaming #riseup #blessed #shoutout to all heroic men facing abusive situations, may your #recovery be blessed. @grayrock

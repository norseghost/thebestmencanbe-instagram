@isadorakosofsky sent me the rest of the pictures she took for the story today. After looking through the photos, dakota said "you really know how to close out a chapter in your life, beeb" ha.

They brought to light the support of my friends and chosen family. This chapter was one of those times that shows a person who thier real friends are, and aren't. 
Anyway the photos are compositionally breathtaking, each one telling a full story. And each of these, in particular, capture the depths of which each friend met me in this space where others couldn't.

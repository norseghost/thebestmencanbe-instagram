I saw this on FB and had to share. This is so true and goes both ways. Toxic is toxic, no matter the gender. You can’t fix or change anyone else other than yourself. Don’t lose yourself in the process of trying to heal or fix someone else. Work on and heal yourself. When you are in an emotionally healthy place, you will naturally attract other emotionally healthy people and weed out the ones who aren’t. Self care, inner work and healing should be your priority. You have one life to live. Live it fully for yourself and the rest will fall into place.  #healing #selfcare #toxic #women #men #livefully #metoo #domesticviolence #innerwork #choosetolive #zen #selfdefense #abuse #rehabilitation #emotionallyhealthy #onelifetolive

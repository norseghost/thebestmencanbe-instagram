#TomTour Update: “Meet Maggi van Dorn (FJV Berkeley 2008-09). Maggi is the creator of the podcast “Deliver Us” which is part of America Media.  The podcast is dedicated to giving voice to victims of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.  I met Maggi at a conference entitled “Lay Leadership for a Wounded Church and Divided Nation” hosted by the Initiative for Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown.  Thank you, Maggi, for creating space for these stories to be told.” #ICYMI

I have stuggled with weather or not to post here about the changes to fertility laws in the US. Its shocking, and I see it as a direct atack on women's rights. I struggle with posting on my buisness page, what would be my intention...... In choosing to post... I am going to talk about #magicalresistance
this is something I just stumbled across today catching up on podcasts. The amazing idea is to use spell work to assist the changes that need to happen in our world and politics. Add personal or group ritual to your protesting, marchibg, letter writing and voting. ( I for one am much better at spells than letters to my MP- which I have done üôÇ) There is a "bind Trump" community ritual happening monthly ! I have included the FB link because I cannot stay stay silent. None of us should. I'll be joining the next ritual.

So sisters to the south we have your back up here in Canada ‚ù§üçÅ https://www.facebook.com/groups/OfficialBindTrump/

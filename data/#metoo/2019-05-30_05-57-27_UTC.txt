THURSDAY THOUGHT: "THE SEVEN SERIES": WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE" Ep 6 SIOBHAN's STORY

As a producer in the Film & TV industry, @ms.siobhan_ has been actively involved in trying to effect change since the revelations/birthing of the "MeToo" and "Time's Up" campaigns. As Siobhan explains to us the policies that she has been helping to see implemented, it's wonderful to see her taking a stance on behalf of men in the workplace as well as women. üëåüèº If you've watched the very first episode of this whole series, you'll understand on an even deeper level why Siobhan's stance is so powerful.

Click on the link in my bio to watch Siobhan's FULL episode and stay encouraged! ‚úåüèºüçÄ The purpose of the stories in this series is 3-fold: to make you realise it's ok not to be ok, to know you're not the only one going through what you're going through and that you can choose HOPE.

All the ladies involved have said you can reach out to them directly should anything they say resonate with you.

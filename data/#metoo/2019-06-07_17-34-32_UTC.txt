@theellenshow I want to thank you for being so brave. When I saw this it reminded me on why I’m doing what I’m doing. For years I was afraid to tell my story. For just the same reason on why #ellen mentions here. Afraid of people to not believe or judge you. I got a lot of positive but also ALOT of negative feedback when I mentioned I wanted to raise money for a sexual assault nonprofit organization. I was asked “WHY would you raise money for a organization while training for a bodybuilding bikini show?” Not that I have to explain myself but just as Ellen mentions here, I want to help woman to have a voice. That your not alone and yet strong to overcome something that was out of your control. You are a true SURVIVOR. For me to raise money to help others will motivate me to finish this fitness journey. Self worth is something I always lacked. I hide behind the strong business woman that seems can take over the world. But behind closed doors since I was 18 it’s been a true struggle to love me for me. This bikini competition is one of my biggest fears yet will be my biggest accomplishment. The fear to be vulnerable to walk out on that stage in a bathing suit while everyone is looking at you. It’s not about winning that trophy. Its about being confident & loving you. It’s about raising money for those in the need but also letting go of the past and fears. I use to emotionally eat and gain weight thinking it would protect me to never get hurt again. Instead of saying something I just kept quiet and became insecure. I would choose men who treated me like crap. Let people walk all over me say sorry for things they did because I didn’t think I was worth it. Years later and some wake up calls that time is now over. I don’t care anymore what people think. My voice will be heard and the healing has begun. I will raise money, get on that stage in October in Miami then speak to young woman at schools to never give up on you. #survivor#charity#metoo#nevergiveup#gym#training#raiin#abuse#raisemoney#fear#overcome#inspire#motivate#womanstrong#beavoice#lift#train#losangeles#miami#nyc#casting#model#speakup#ellenshow#ellentv#muscle#transformation#voice#power

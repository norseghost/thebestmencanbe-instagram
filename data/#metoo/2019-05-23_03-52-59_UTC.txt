BREAKING🔴 #onceuponatimeinhollywood sequel confirmed✅✅✅ Reportedly the movie will see Mr. Tarantino himself drive around LA🚘 with known child abuser Roman Polanski🤭 When asked for comment, Mr. Tarantino went on a rant🤬about "bitch ass reporters" and their "nagging hypotheses"🗣 Later adding "the beauty is that Roman and I get to share this really intimate space away from PC *n-words* where we can truly explore the implications of being a rich white man in a hostile world"🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏻‍♂️ Tarantino then called Samuel L. Jackson📞 and asked him to justify his usage of the n-word to us. Rumors say the Baha Men are still asking "who let the pervs out?"🤷🏾‍♂️

High School Graduation✔️ This year has been extremely difficult, especially with schooling. My panic attacks and seizure like shakes kept me in bed and unable to go to school for the entire first semester of school. Having to quit polo and seeing my friends every day was extremely difficult. But I joined an adult school and worked my ass off to finish. It was hard overcoming my mental and physical health issues. But I’m so happy and proud that I got through it triumphant. I couldn’t have done this without the love and support from my family and friends. I love you all 💕💕 #metoo

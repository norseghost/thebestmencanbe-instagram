The solution is allowing women the same opportunity in education and income as men. Despite women comprising more than half of all medical school applicants, a 2015 study reported that only 19.2% of American surgeons are women. Research has also shown that these same women are less likely to be given career promotions and can expect to receive $1 million less than their male coworkers.⁣

Outside of America, data from Lancet Commission on Global Surgery reveals that for every 1 million people in low-income countries, there are only 3 female surgeons. This is due to the immense amount of discrimination directed towards women in all stages of life. Bias towards women and young girls has created a culture where education is not promoted as an opportunity for girls in the way it is for men. ⁣
⁣
The United Nations estimates “130 million girls ages 6 to 17 are no longer enrolled in school, and 15 million girls of primary school age will never set foot in a classroom.” If this were not the case and young women in these countries were encouraged and allowed education, more female surgeons would inevitably be produced. Studies show that health outcomes improve when female surgeons/physicians are involved in treatment.⁣

Currently, female surgical students tend to drop out of the practice for reasons such as:⁣
• “Absence of interactions with women in surgical section and other support"⁣
• “Distinction between valid and invalid reasons for leaving [being put on leave]" ⁣
• "Poor mental health" and more.⁣
⁣
 A proposed solution is for the U.S. to use its economic power to support the improvement of educational opportunity and invest in programs for women of all ages in developing countries. Additionally, women in powerful positions across the globe can show themselves as role models to girls told they are simply housewives and caretakers.⁣

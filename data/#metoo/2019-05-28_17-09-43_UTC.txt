TW: sexual abuse, rape
.
My body has been scarred,
Not by falling on the ground,
No, I didn’t slip on my baby feet,
But that uncle bought me chocolates,
He did it, he touched me,
I didn’t know, what that meant,
But it did not feel good,
Something was wrong,
I tried to run away, 
I needed another chocolate,
I thought to run to mom,
But my body pained,
Ahh, it never pained like that,
Not even when the doctor
Gave those injections,
I couldn’t move,
There was something on my frock,
Blood, I didn’t know where it came from,
Was I dying ? 
But I didn’t do anything wrong ?
I just took a chocolate
Mom said, it’s bad to take it from strangers,
But he was not a stranger,
I cried but no one was at home,
No one could hear,
All I could hear was that uncle
Asked me not to say to anyone,
I was hating his presence,
His hands felt like prison,
I was caged, 
Not just that day but for ages,
It haunted me, even now,
Now, when I know, 
That chocolate was not just a gift,
It took away everything,
I was silent, I thought,
I was the only one,
I thought the society won’t accept me,
I was no more pious and pure,
Any touch still haunts my body,
Any stranger, no everyone 
Still seems like a danger,
I knew that childhood memories 
Vanish with time,
But that was a curse,
It stayed,
Never went away,
It’s still really clear,
Clear in my mind,
That very day and night,
I remember the face even now,
But there are more faces,
More memories and 
Only nightmares. .

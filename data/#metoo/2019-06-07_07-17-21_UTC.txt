This is me.
Laughing at my own damn self, me.
Finding joy in this moment with one of my favoritist people in the world, and completely filled with gratitude.
Damn, I'm so freaking blessed.

I've been witnessing some of the most intensely magical moments, both in my own life, and in others around me. People following their passions, their hearts, and the dreams of their souls. And it is INFECTIOUS.

There is so much power in the understanding of being authentic, and being BRAVE. When we are brave, we inadvertently give permission to others around us, to be brave as well. We NEED more of this in the world, don't we?

So I'm here. I'm posting this photo of me that I LOVE because of the JOY in this moment. That I felt so INSECURE when I was sitting on this bench, but my cousin was on the other side of the lense, building me up, telling me I was beautiful.

YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.
I AM BEAUTIFUL.
WE ARE BEAUTIFUL.

Believe it in your soul, if not for you, then to lift others around you. Let's elevate ourselves, so that we may elevate others around us.

Live life, dear friends.
Be BRAVE.

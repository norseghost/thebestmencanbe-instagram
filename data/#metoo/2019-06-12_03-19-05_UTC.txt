Unfortunately My Dear Black Male Volunteer Queen @vdiggitydawg received her 1st “RTS” (Return to Sender)Letter for our Queen Latoni. If you volunteered to write a letter and mailed it let me know if it is sent back to you as “rejected” mail. No matter what happens we will not stop writing! “The Revolution will be mailed !”-Queen A’Sis’T

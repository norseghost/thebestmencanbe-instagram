Warning! Serious Question // Could You Protect Yourself?â €
â €
Check out our stories for some real life scenarios (like last couple months). If you were one of the unlucky ones, do you have the skills to protect yourself??? â €
â €
Good news: if you are in Denver check out an intro/all levels to self-defense class we are hosting with @kravmagadenver #linkinbio . â €
â €
If you are not in Denver, search for local self defense classes.  Krav Maga has been known to be an excellent form of self defense training used by Israeli military, and police forces.  Sometimes local police departments offer classes as well. â €
â €
Regardless, make sure you have the skills to protect your beautiful badass self!â €

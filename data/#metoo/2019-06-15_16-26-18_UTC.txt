We heard so many stories of resilience and women defying all the odds -- weather they emigrated to a new country in search for a better future or they broke their family rules in order to achieve their vision, these women never gave up.

They celebrated their ambition and took real pride in what they have accomplished in spite of the political/patriarchal/societal challenges they have faced. These women reminded us of the inner strength that is always available to us when we dare to commit to what we want.

What is one thing you would like to celebrate at the end of today? And at the end to this year? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

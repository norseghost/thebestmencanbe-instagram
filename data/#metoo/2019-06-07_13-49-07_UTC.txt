Day 7. #30daysofgay 🏳️‍🌈
I’m heartbroken And angry as I share Day 7. The news out of London is infuriating. In case you aren’t aware, a female couple was beaten by a group of men for refusing to kiss for the men’s entertainment. They also robbed the women. 🏳️‍🌈
My heart breaks for this couple and for all LGBTQ+ individuals facing discrimination, sexualization and assault daily. 🏳️‍🌈
I can’t even wrap my mind around something like this happening my my wife and I, but it’s absolutely possible that it could. 🏳️‍🌈
This is why the LGBTQ+ community needs #pride. This is why ALL women and victims of sexual assault and harassment need #metoo. This is why we need allies, education and why we need to VOTE. 🏳️‍🌈
I hope these men get caught, punished and revealed as the garbage they are.

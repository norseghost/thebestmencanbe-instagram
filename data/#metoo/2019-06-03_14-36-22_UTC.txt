This girl has just lost 125lbs, she is slowly realizing that the pounds we merely a result of the only coping skill she had to deal. Her bullies still sat beside her. The pain and truth of her past were now erased when the pounds were lost, the weight of her pain remained in her now small shoulders, to carry alone.  Sadly more baggage would be added  before she was able to share some of the load with another... #survivor #bullies #weightloss #coping #copingskills #lessonslearned  #metoo  #metooagain

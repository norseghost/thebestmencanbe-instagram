I have to put out firm reminder again that I am NOT working with the individual behind “Tapigami” anymore. I took a principled stance to remove him and stand in support of others about ~6 months ago, and I’ve withdrawn all consent for him to use my likeness or my tape artwork.

I’d estimate 90% of my tape artwork I created since 2012 is still not in my possession. These pictures represent just a small sample to show my distinct and unique self-expression using artistic techniques I’ve honed myself, like any other artist in any other medium.

Much of its condition deliberately remains unknown to me. I’ve seen some of it being used without my permission, even after I made it clear he is not to use it and plainly asserted and offered attempts at solutions for getting it back.

If you see my pieces being used inappropriately or you have information as to their current state, I would like to know. It could only help me continue to make well-informed actions moving forward.

I’ve worked in close proximity with him longer than most people often blurring the line between who is who and who’s art is who’s -- I leave numerous indelible marks on this art form through years of partnership. While those years together had highs and wonderful memories, I have many troubling first-hand experiences, I’ve personally been made uncomfortable by him in front of other people, and I’ve definitely heard other’s accounts that I prudently won’t detail here because they will likely need to support other people at a later date.

What I can confidently state?

A few dozen “emails” is DEFINITELY NOT the whole story and this is an on-going, still-evolving situation where more information appears likely to surface.

Thanks for reading.

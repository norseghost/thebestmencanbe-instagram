A common response to bullying is for people to beat themselves up about their reaction and sense of helplessness.
˙
‘I’m stronger than this’ or ‘I shouldn’t be feeling like this’ are common refrains of the bullying victim.
˙
Accepting that your emotional response is not a sign of weakness or some inner defect is important in your recovery. So is recognising that you had little real choice in your response. The reptilian part of your brain was in charge, there.
˙
One antidote to this self-disgust is to take a ‘lessons learned’ approach and think about what you’ve learned about yourself (and yourself in the world) as a result of this experience.
˙
Remember: all you did was get up and go to work like everybody else. If you’d seen the situation coming, you would have avoided it!

Anger is something Ive never fully let myself feel. 
Ive always felt my anger was "bad", and tried my best to hold it down and be pleasant and compliant, partially because of the situation I was in and partially just because thats how I was told to be as someone born female. But I've had about of it. 
My anger is justified a lot of times. Its my passion and frustration for what I see is unjust. Its how I respond when people arent treated right. Its the fire in my heart that drives me to try to do good things. My anger comes out when people treat me poorly, and that is okay. We need to be angry or nothing changes. 
So yes. I am angry. At the country I live in. At the people who have allowed it to go this far and still support our president.  Im angry at the people who have hurt me and taken things from me I can never get back. Im angry that what I can and can't do with my body is still a discussion held by old cishet white men. Im angry that we arent doing more to help our earth. 
And that anger is gonna push me to try to make a change. Im going to use it to fuel my passion instead of unhealthy things like violence.  And that is what gives me power.

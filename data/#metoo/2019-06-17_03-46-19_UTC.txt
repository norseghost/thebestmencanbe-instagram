Last week I attended the @lambdaliterary awards, where I represented by third anthology, "Written on the Body" with @jkpbooks , full of letters that fellow #trans survivors of #domesticviolence and #sexualsssault wrote to their body parts. I'm thankful as heck that hours before the ceremony, @bradcalcaterra asked, "What are you proud of? 🏳️‍🌈" Here is my response, and in a way my speech for having the honor and responsibility of carrying this project, and ultimately myself, over the years. ((Also special thanks to @missdestinydunkle
For eating burgers with me afterwards 🎈🎈)).

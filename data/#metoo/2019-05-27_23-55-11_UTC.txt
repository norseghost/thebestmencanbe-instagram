Welcome to my Instagram account. I’m Diane Demetre, author, speaker and presenter. I recently won the 2019 SBAA International Women’s Day Leadership Award for leadership in the Entertainment, Creative Arts and Media Industry. A great and humbling honour. Join me on my journey as I write contemporary fiction novels featuring empowered heroines who live life to the fullest. Much like I do on the forever-fabulous Gold Coast, Australia with my furry family. Buckle up friends!

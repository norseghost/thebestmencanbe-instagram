#stillnotaskingforit 
Honored to get this badass tattoo by @nolan_void to support the @stillnotaskingforit_flashevent, where proceeds go to local organizations that support sexual trauma survivors. This tattoo means a lot to me, as a sexual trauma therapist, survivor, and someone who is actively working on changing the conversations around consent (which starts well outside the bedroom). I want to thank the guys at @thirdstreettattoo for putting on this event, and the respect and care I saw them provide to all their customers (mostly women) yesterday. And again, thank you @nolan_void for creating a space where I felt safe, validated, and well cared for. If anyone in the South Bay is looking for a badass artist and all-around cool dude, I could not recommend Nolan higher.

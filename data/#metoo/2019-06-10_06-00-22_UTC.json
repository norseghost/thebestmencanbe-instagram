                        "text": "#ILC2019 \u270a A HISTORIC VOTE ON ENDING VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT AGAINST WOMEN AND MEN IN THE WORLD OF WORK \ud83d\udc4f  From 10-21 June, more than 40 heads of state and over 5000 delegates from 187 countries will participate in two weeks of negotiation around pressing topics at the Centenary Session of the International Labour Conference. There, a historic vote will take place on the FIRST EVER international standard on violence and harassment in the world of work. \ud83d\udca5\n.\nViolence and harassment is an abuse of power that significantly threatens the health, safety and dignity of many workers in the garment industry. Violence and harassment at work takes many forms including physical violence, threats, intimidation, bullying, harassment and unwanted sexual attention. Whilst both women and men experience violence and harassment in the world of work, unequal status and power relations in society and at work often result in women being far more exposed to violence and harassment.\ud83d\ude45 Gender-based violence remains one of the most tolerated violations of workers\u2019 human rights. According to statistics, 35% of women\u2014818 million women globally\u2014over the age of 15 have experienced sexual or physical violence at home, in their communities or in the workplace. Yet there is currently no international law that sets a minimum standard to eradicate violence and harassment, including gender-based violence, in the world of work.\n.\nAdoption of a new instrument requires a two-thirds majority at the Conference. If a Convention is passed, all ILO member states must submit the Convention to their national authority for consideration of ratification. States who ratify the Convention will need to ensure that their national legislation is in conformity with the Convention\u2019s minimum standards. \ud83c\udf10 This means that national lobbying and advocacy activities will need to go well beyond the ILC 2019 to see the successful implementation of this standard in the workplace.\n.\nStay tuned for updates from ILC2019 throughout the conference.

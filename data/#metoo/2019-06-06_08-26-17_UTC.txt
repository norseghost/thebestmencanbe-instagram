Health, Labor and Welfare Minister Takumi Nemoto said he will not support a drive to ban dress codes that force women to wear high heels at work.

“It's generally accepted by society that (wearing high heels) is necessary and reasonable in workplaces”, Nemoto said.

Last Monday, members of the #KuToo movement (an amalgam of #MeToo and the Japanese words for shoes, ‘kutsu’ -靴-, and pain, ‘kutsuu’ -苦痛-) submitted a petition with 18,800 signatures to the labor ministry calling for the government to ban companies from requiring women to wear high heels in the workplace, citing health and other issues.

Nemoto added wearing high heels would be an abuse of power if a worker with a hurt foot is forced to wear them.

So,  I've been organizing,  helping to organize, and participating in a LOT of activism, events, and such for the last almost 5 years - doing my best to "be the change." .
.

I JUST found out about this book by Ken Schneck and Shane McCleveland. It's a history of LGBTQAAI+ activism in Columbus. .
.

I am SO PROUD to find out I have been included in this collection. .
.

GREAT BOOK. Go get you one. .

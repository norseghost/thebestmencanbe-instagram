✨What better way to kick off summer than with a box of plant magic?! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
From 🐜 spray, glowing skin 🧖🏻‍♀️, mermaid hair 🧜‍♀️, all the zen vibes since your kids are now home all day 🤣, and the the best sleep ever 💤 , I got you fam! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
When you grab your kit before the end of May Young Living Essential Oils will send you a bottle of Thieves Household Cleaner concentrate with the prettiest glass bottle! I use this stuff to clean our house from top to bottom and even Hudson’s high chair because it’s so safe! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
No seriously, on the bottle it says if ingested drink water to dilute the oils! That peace of mind is worth it all! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
When you make your kit your first Essential Rewards order (how I get free goodies and restock my oils/ household goods every month!) I will send you a second diffuser! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Now your whole house can smell amazing and you can even diffuse on your porch to keep the 🐜 away! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you’ve been on the fence this for you! You won’t want to miss this deal for your summer survival kit! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

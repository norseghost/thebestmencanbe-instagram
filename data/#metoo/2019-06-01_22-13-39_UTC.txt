This page has many purposes.  First, to give victims' a voice.  So many people find comfort in telling their stories but may not be able to. This page is anonymous.  It is also here to give courage. You are not alone.  Second, it is here to bring awareness and advocate.  Your stories don't need to be skeletons in your closet. For me, not fearing my past and my story gave me such a freedom and healing. I hope the same for you. If you have a story to share, please email theworldswomen@gmail.com .

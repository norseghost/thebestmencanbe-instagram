#LenaWaithe hits #thebreakfastclub to talk accountability for her knowledge of actor #JasonMitchell’s alleged sexual harassment and misconduct after season 1 of #TheChi. Waithe’s response to the reports were to “hire a woman of color as the showrunner” and “to have sexual assault training on set”. Ebony also reports that after Season 2, Ayanna Floyd (hired showrunner) reported that the events persisted from Mitchell, telling Waithe that she should “let HR handle it”, which Waithe then agreed to. So many questions. Waithe thought that hiring a Black woman and providing sexual assault training would reform a predator?! Took no action to remove him from the show even after season 2 reports?! Plenty excuses, not enough accountability. Thoughts?

🤔As I was pondering on what I would post today,  as it is Father's Day,  I think of how I used to be.🤔 😡I used to be angry
😭I cried a LOT
🍻I used to raise a glass and middle finger 🖕 with fellow children of bad dads as I got hammered drunk
😶 the first couple years after he passed, I was numb. 
With the past year's journey of mental, spiritual and emotional growth, I forgave him. 🤝🤝 Today, I thank him.🧘‍♀️ I thank him, not for doing what he did, but before that, he was a very good dad. I was daddy's little girl before he did wrong.  I still hold on to some of the positive things he taught me to love such as fishing🐟 and cars 🚘, etc. He made me into a tomboy,  tough, good work ethic. 
But the biggest reason I thank him is although it was terrible for what he did,  I am a strong💪 and powerful💥 person for surviving and moving past it. I have the drive to push through things that bring me down. I never give up. 🏋️‍♀️ So although you have passed, I do thank you for the life lessons. Happy Father's Day

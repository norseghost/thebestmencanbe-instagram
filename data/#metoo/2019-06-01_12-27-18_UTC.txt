‼️FAHAD MUSTAFA IN HOT WATERS AFTER CRACKING AN INSENSITIVE JOKE! ‼️🙄⁣
⁣
We’ve seen time and again that Pakistani celebrities often take serious issues like sexual abuse and harassment lightly. Some of them even cracking jokes regarding the #MeToo movement. This time it is Fahad Mustafa. ⁣
⁣
While filming a recent episode for his show, @mustafafahad26 was being chased by his friends on set. He reportedly said:⁣
⁣
“I will be putting up a harassment case against you on Facebook. This is the trend these days. I’ll see you guys tomorrow."⁣
⁣
The internet was quick to catch that and lash out at Fahad for such a tasteless remark! ⁣
⁣
While people  can feign naivety, these supposedly ‘informed’ celebs need to reform themselves!! We didn't expect this from Fahad at least! ⁣

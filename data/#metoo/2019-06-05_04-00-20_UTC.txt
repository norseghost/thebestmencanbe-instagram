Family, domestic and sexual violence is a major national health and welfare issue that can have lifelong impacts for victims and perpetrators. It affects people of all ages and from all backgrounds, but predominantly affects women and children. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016 Personal Safety Survey (PSS) estimated that 2.2 million adults have been victims of physical and/or sexual violence from a partner since the age of 15 (ABS 2017c).

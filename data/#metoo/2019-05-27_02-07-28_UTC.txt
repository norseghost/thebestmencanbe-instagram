My circle is fucking lit! And it's filled with women! 
There was a time in my life when I didn't have close friendships with women. I was definitely in a different space in my life and that came with drama! 
I used to buy into the belief that women didn't support one another, didn't want what's best for another **insert whatever mind fuck belief you hear here*** But here's the truth we do support one another, we do uplift each other, we do love on and fix each other's crown and my circle is FILLED with all of them! 
If your circle ain't lit, your circle ain't shit! (Omg... I think I could have been a rapper! @Kaylmusic I'm on your next track! @cecygaskin you got background vocals! ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚) Imma meme this! 
We are here to light the fucking world on ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥! To burn shit down and build it back up! And on the days that you forget it, you should have a sister there to  be your hype woman and help you remember who the fuck you are! 
Because you are a Divine fucking being, who was placed on this earth in Divine fucking perfect timing! 
You are incredible and don't let anyone ever convince you of otherwise! 
You're fuckin' lit! ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ #pawntoqueen #embodyher #projectloveyourself #unapologeticallyyou #womenempoweringwomen #womemrising #womenwarriors #women #womensempowerment #knowyourcircle #metoo #timesup #sisterhood #friendship #sisters

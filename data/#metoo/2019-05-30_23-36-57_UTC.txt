The worst lies are the ones we tell ourselves. Change happens when we become who we truly are. Here are a few tips to get out of The Vortex and start to take your life back:
💪🏽 Be brutally honest with yourself. You know what you need to do.
👟 Take the first step. It's the hardest and most important.
🌌 Give yourself the space to fall back. It takes time to get to where you want to be.
❤️ Be compassionate with yourself. You must learn to love yourself.
🙋🏽‍♂️ Leverage your friends and community. They will support you.
🤬 Stop Making Excuses! No Excuses! Just Results!

Justice is a LIE 
This is the most special piece I have made so I decided to share it with you. Much of my art relies heavily on symbolism and this piece is no exception. This is a piece that I identify with and Iâ€™m sure many of you do as well whether itâ€™s from a personal experience, someone you know, or even just a story you saw. Remember donâ€™t let anyone minimize your hardships, donâ€™t compare your plights to others, and remember the only validity in life you truly need is your own~ðŸ–¤

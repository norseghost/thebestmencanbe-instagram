⚠️ trigger warning: sexual + emotional abuse, self-harm, trust issues with men. This poem was so unbelievably difficult to write let alone speak and publish. I originally was going to write and burn it as a way of healing, except at the beginning of this year I promised myself I would unconditionally speak my truth no matter how hard it was. I promised myself I would take my heart places in need of love and inspire and support other women to own their power. I shouldn’t have to make this disclaimer, but for the sake of the internet, please show up with grace or keep scrolling. I am NOT posting this to debate my experiences and emotions. If you believe I am doing this for attention you are missing the point, my friend. I am also NOT saying men are shitty people. That would make an extremely unjust claim as there are millions of beautiful, kind-hearted, generous men who help to empower women everyday. Thank you again for letting me take up space today. I feel unstoppable and free. Xx all the love to you, wherever today finds you.

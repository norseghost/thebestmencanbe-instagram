                        "text": "For this week's #SocialJusticeSunday we will be honoring Tarana Burke. \"She is an African-American civil rights activist. She's most well-known as the founder of the 'Me Too' movement in 2006 which has blossomed into a worldwide campaign to raise awareness about sexual harassment, abuse, and assault in society. In 2017 Burke and other influential female activists were named 'the silence breakers' by Time magazine. [Although Burke began using the phrase 'Me Too' a decade prior it didn't reach the height of it's popularity until actress Alyssa Milano tweeted using the hashtag encouraging survivors of sexual harassment, abuse and assault to use the #MeToo]... In a few short days, 40,000 people had responded to Milano\u2019s tweet directly and more than 12 million people had used the hashtag across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The Me Too Movement was now global and survivors everywhere now had the words, the platform, and a voice to tell their stories. Tarana Burke was surprised to see her phrase 'me too' in a tweet by Milano and even more shocked by the enormous overnight following it received. She never thought in her wildest dreams that her work from over a decade ago would help millions of survivors worldwide. Tarana Burke originally coined the phrase 'me too' while working at Just Be Inc., a nonprofit she founded in 2003 that focused on the overall well-being of young women of color. Burke was talking with a girl who revealed that her mother\u2019s boyfriend had been sexually abusing her. Burke was left searching for the right words to help empathize with the countless women and young girls who have disclosed their experiences to her. Ever since, Burke has shared the message with survivors everywhere: 'You\u2019re not alone. This happened to me too.' From this point forward, 'me too' helped Burke shape her life-long campaign for activism to help girls and women who have experienced sexual harassment, abuse, or assault.\" (Source:biography.com)\n#activism #SJS #community #faith #SocialJustice #sustainability #multifaith #interfaith #nonprofit #SocialGood #students #StudentLife #CollegeLife #UCD #UCDavis #davis #UniversityHousing #undergrad #graduate #sjw #religious #religion"

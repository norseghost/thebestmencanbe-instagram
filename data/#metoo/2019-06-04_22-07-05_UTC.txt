Woody Allen to shoot next movie in Spain, with Christoph Waltz
#LOSANGELES #WoodyAllen is set to #shoot his next #movie in #Spain this #summer with #Oscar #winner #ChristophWaltz, the #director's first film project since #ARainyDayinNewYork that was shelved at the height of the #MeToo #movement. Spanish production company #MediaProStudio said in a
#statement on Tuesday that #Allen would begin #filming in #SanSebastian in July on a #romantic #comedy about an #American #couple who visit the San Sebastian film festival.
Allen, 83, is a four-time Oscar winner, but some Hollywood
actors distanced themselves from him in late 2017 and early 2018
as a sexual misconduct scandal, fueled by the grassroots #MeToo
movement, swept the entertainment industry.
His 2017 film #WonderWheel #starring #KateWinslet and
#JustinTimberlake, took in just $1.4 million at the North
American box office but grossed $14.5 million overseas.

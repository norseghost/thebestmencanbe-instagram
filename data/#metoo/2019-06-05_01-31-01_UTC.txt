New Blog Post - 'Making it work" - Link in Bio
-
Yes, I am a recovering people pleaser. -
But I have found that in pleasing myself I am finding the validation that I so desperately tried to get by pleasing others. -
And the phrase, 'Make it work' has taken on a whole new meaning to me. -
Now I make my life work for me, instead of changing it to make it work for others.

TRIGGER WARNING! This song involves potentially disturbing content for survivors. I made this song to highlight the reality of sexual assault, but also to recognize the incredible strength and courage it takes to come forward. To all the survivors of sexual assault: You have a voice, even though what you've been through is unspeakable. I hear your voice. I hear your story. #Metoo #metoomovement #consent #yourvoicematters #ally #love

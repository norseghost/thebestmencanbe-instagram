Reminded by a yoga journal post of this vid that i posted last year - i had these cards made years ago and they continue to be such an important part of creating a culture of consent, comfort, healing and respect at our studio. 
I’ve found that there are so many great ways to let your students know that THEY are the experts of their experience, so many ways to hand the power back, so many ways that we can find freedom together.

We offer these cards for purchase at our studio and also are happy to simply share how we made them if you want to DIY 😊🙏🏻 #gotconsent #traumasensitiveyoga #traumainformed #respect #metoo #whatwouldlovedo #empower #yogaheals #wildwomen #dharma #karmayoga #bethechange #bethelight @yogaonhighfoundation @yogaonhigh

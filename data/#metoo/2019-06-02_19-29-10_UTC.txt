So we ask someone to "understand our point of view" but we dont listen.
.
We ask someone to "accept us," but we are rigid and closed minded.
.
We ask someone to be "on time" but you are always fuggin late.
.
Dude. Stop requesting things from others that you dont demand from yourself.
.
Stop asking people to do stuff that you wont do.
.
Stop asking people to be the person you are not cause you dont wanna do what it takes to be it.
.
Listen, truly listen...
.
This is your opportunity to really step out of the idea that you are "owed" or that you "deserve" someone better.
.
This is also an opportunity to embody every aspect of who you want to be and attract those people, relationships and opportunities in your life. Really...its only a matter of recognizing that the reason you cant get what you want is cause you haven't become the person you were supposed to become.
.

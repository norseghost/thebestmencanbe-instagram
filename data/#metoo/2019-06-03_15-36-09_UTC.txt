Supposed horror film with two hot shot Cello players, of all things, get together during a symposium in China and things begin to spiral out of control in The Perfection a new movie on Netflix.  The two ladies are young in thier twenties, Charlotte who begins the film is a master cellist who left the school where she and Lizzie performed and who was taking care of her now dead mother, there is a bit of foreshadowing of Charlotte, who is about seven years older than Lizzie, as going through some shock treatment and she also is a suicide ‘attempter’ as her scars are prominently displayed.  The two ladies hit it off and yep, the lesbian thing kicks right in, as you’d suspect, and the two ladies hop about in bed a bit, nothing too porno, though, this is Netflix after all, not HBO.  The two ladies decide to get onto a run down bus that is taking them into the mountains of Shanghai to backpack of all things.  Lizzie begins a long long screaming and vomiting sequence which leads to both ladies being thrown off the bus.  Lizzie begins to hallucinate her sickness and surprisingly Charlotte appears to be the one causing Lizzie’s sickness.  All of this leads back to the music school where both ladies were instructed and focuses upon the headmaster, Anton.  Oddly the whole film becomes a rather weird rape revenge film, there isn’t much horror in it, or intelligence, as Charlotte is kidnapped by Lizzie and fails at ‘the perfection’ (playing the Cello without a mistake), so called.  In the end things are convoluted and rather ridiculous as the movie goes back and forth rewinding itself into further realms of stupidity.

4.0 Out Of 10

Most critics are calling the film a #metoo fantasy, which appears to be the next event on the horizon.  All to say that you can place this film as one of Netflix’s worst, which reminds of so many others, best left forgotten.  The Perfection is anything but that.

RYAN ADAMS
In interviews, seven women and more than a dozen associates described a pattern of manipulative behavior in which singer-songwriter Ryan Adams dangled career opportunities while simultaneously pursuing female artists for sex using music as a point of control. One of the victims was a 14-year old girl.

His #amazingapology sounded like this: “To anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally, I apologize deeply and unreservedly, but the picture that this article (#newyorktimes) paints is upsettingly inaccurate. Some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright false. I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage. Period.” AMAZING!

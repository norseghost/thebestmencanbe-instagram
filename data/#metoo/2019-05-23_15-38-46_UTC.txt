I posted this last week on my personal account, but I thought it was appropriate to do it on here as well. Thank you for reading. â€”
I go back and forth with opening up about my past. Itâ€™s very hard for me to talk about without breaking down, but Iâ€™ve also learned that keeping it inside has affected me too. We all have a past and a story thatâ€™s molded us to who we are today. Mine isnâ€™t a good one. It robbed me from my high school years. If you know me back then, I hated myself and school. Most of it was a blur because I was so miserable and broken. I blamed myself for so long that it was my fault. I chose not to speak up because I was ashamed. Looking back I wish I could have told myself that this was NOT my fault. I didnâ€™t do anything wrong. Iâ€™m speaking up now because I know Iâ€™m not alone. I know that this happens way too often and majority of the accusers walk away or get a bullshit of a sentence. Today, Iâ€™ve decided to speak my truth. Iâ€™ve been through hell and back and I am a  SURVIVOR! I still battle PTSD from time to time but I am slowly getting better. Itâ€™s been a very long and exhausting battle. Itâ€™s hard to rise above sometimes especially when Iâ€™ve never really dealt with my past in a healthy way, but I am now. I write this to hopefully shed some light for someone that might be going through a difficult time. Youâ€™re not alone. You are not to blame. It does get better. Itâ€™s okay to talk about it. The month of May is Mental Health Awareness. Itâ€™s a real thing you all. Letâ€™s all try to shed some positivity and not judge others because nobody knows what people are going through behind closed doors. We need more kindness in this world and less hatred and judgment. ðŸ’œ

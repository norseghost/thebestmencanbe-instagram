Did you know that tonight it is a strawberry full moon? üçìüåú Just in time for my birthday! 
My third post affects me the most directly, which is about females. While there is some movement towards having women leaders and gender equality, society in general is still very much patriarchal. I wish to see more support and uplifting of women esp women of colour (WOC) in all areas ie. C-suite roles, filmmakers, the government, acting, modelling, engineering, the justice system, etc. The other issue is that we need to give all women the benefit of the doubt when they speak out about any violations towards them. The #metoo movement has been strong but there is still an inclination from society to still question the victim. Why does society still refuse to believe women? Why does society still label women as crazy, hysterical, or psycho (omg I hate that song)? Why is objectification still the norm? Why are the achievements of women not celebrated enough? Why do we just view women as vessels for procreation? Why is society taking away women's choices on her own body? What I want and what is needed is for women to be put on the pedestals that men have been standing on since the beginning of time. We need to put women in charge. ‚úäüë≠ #women #females #womenleaders #femaleleaders #believeher #wordsofwisdom #wordstoliveby #Birthday #oia #greece #santorini #travel #wanderlust #travelblog #europe #patriarchy #femalepower #womenpower #woc #womenofcolor #strawberrymoon #junebaby #gemini #travelphotography

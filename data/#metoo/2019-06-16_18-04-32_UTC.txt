The world has made incredible progress in shattering the glass ceiling and empowering women. But there's still a long way to go. This is by no means an exhaustive list of all of the double standards women still face, but here are 10 ways women are unfairly inconvenienced, shamed, and discriminated against just for being female.
⠀
6. Cleavage is prevalent in advertisements and media, but women breastfeeding their children in public are often told to cover up.
⠀
7. Men are disproportionately praised for taking care of their children, whereas women are expected to be caregivers.
⠀
8. Any parenting decision a woman makes is subject to "mom shaming"&
⠀
9. Dad bods" are considered attractive, but women are expected to lose baby weight after giving birth instantly.
⠀
10. Women pay more for the same everyday items because of the so-called "pink tax." The "pink tax" refers to how products for women, like razors in "feminine" colors, are often pricier than the men's equivalent.
⠀
Unfortunately, this list can easily be continued. There are so many double standards for women, they won’t fit in an insta post, and that’s really disappointing. That’s why we’ve decided to discuss this topic during our first meeting.
⠀
Ladies, please share other examples of double standards in comments!

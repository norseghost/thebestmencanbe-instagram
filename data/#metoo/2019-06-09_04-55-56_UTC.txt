Whether it be Asifa or Twinkle!
Whether they be eight or three.
Whether they wear diaper or frock.
Whether they be Muslim or Hindu.
Whether they be rich or poor. 
It's nothing to with their age, caste, race or any other factors
It's just about humanity and lack of our ethics.
From years till now only the victim, their faces and their age group change! And Not the act of raping them.
So neither our constitution. They roam free! And the ultimate sufferers are the victims family.

I believe our sympathy towards them can't change the situation, but our deeds, protest and unity can surely change the future. It's nothing to be done with the government because every article got a loops a loop hole if analysed deeply. 
Writers and story tellers play a very vital role in our society because what a sward can't do! A pen can surely do.

A year ago I spoke publicly about this #MeToo piece - (this pic is from the artist talks at @manameaartstudio THE NEW SAMOA exhibition by the Manamea artists.) NAFANUA'S DAUGHTERS | MA AU FOI (2018) 
by @nikkimarinerart @nikki.mariner

I painted a schoolgirl in uniform and braids, a grandmother at home, a pastors wife, a working mum, a nofotane, choirgirl, business women, an artist, a fashionista etc. And I painted them all looking directly at the viewer, not shy or apologetic, full eye contact 
Representing Samoan women and girls who stand up for each other, believe each other and support each other. #womensstories 
It is now owned by the fabulous @maugalui fashion label and I think it's on display in the MaugaLui shop.

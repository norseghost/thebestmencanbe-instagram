Very excited to release this week’s episode of (E)STRANGE(D) podcast with Lacanian goddess @jamiesonwebster and her psychoanalytic accomplice #marcuscoelen ... Jamieson and Marcus are practising psychoanalysts and co-authors of the forthcoming Cambridge Introduction to Jacques Lacan. Amongst Jamieson’s many other publications are ‘Conversion Disorder’, (2018), ‘The Life and Death of Psychoanalysis’ (2011) and ‘Stay, Illusion!’ (2013), written with Simon Critchley. Marcus’ publications include a number of works on Proust and Maurice Blanchot. 
In this episode, we talk (very tangentially) about Cassavetes’ #awomanundertheinfluence and how it relates to Freud’s notion of hysteria. We touch on #metoo, work, sickness, sex, genitalia, aliens, mothers, nuns… all your favourite topics :)

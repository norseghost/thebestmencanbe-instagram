. "I didn't report because it was too late for me to even react towards it. I was 6 when was I abused by my tuition teacher’s son. I recalled everything when I was 21 after I watched highway and I remember I cried for days about it. I told my elder brother about it, he said I would kill that bastard. I said no, now he himself has two daughters, I really hope he doesn’t treat them badly.

I grew over it, and now i am really conscious about little girls being alone with elder age men. Because somewhere down i am still scared and i dont want any girl child to ever be in such a situation!" #whydidntireport #metoo #timesup #whyikeptquiet ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

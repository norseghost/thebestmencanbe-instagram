This really hit home,and I’m pretty sure it hits home with everybody else who’s has experienced child abuse. When I hear or read about children who have been abused it’s crystal clear that the child is not to blame, but when it comes to myself and my experience I feel guilty. It’s so fucking absurd,but on the same time it’s so normal. So this goes out to all of you who know what I’m talking about let’s make a pact that we even if it’s just for one day will see our self in the mirror and say I’m not to blame! ❤️

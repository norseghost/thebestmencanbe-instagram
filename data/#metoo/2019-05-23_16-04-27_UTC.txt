This morning, I discovered that my abuser is no longer a registered sex offender as recognized by the state of Pennsylvania. Meaning, that he is no longer required to register as a sexual predator. Essentially, he begins a normal life again. While I knew this day would eventually come, I’m having a lot of difficulty processing the reality of the situation. His registration requirement was only supposed to be for ten years. And ten years have come and gone.

I’m feeling a tremendous sense of invalidation. I am scared. I am worried. To be honest, I feel physically ill. My heart aches for 15 year old Lauren. I wish that I could take her in my arms and protect her from this overwhelming sadness. I’ve spent years coming to terms with the fact that my abuser didn’t just make a mistake. That my assault was not just an error in his judgement. But that it was an act of violence. And today, I am reminded that someone that has inflicted this type of evil on another person – on a child – no longer has to answer to those crimes. His life begins again.

I realize that my words are spotty. I may not be making much sense. But none of this makes sense to me. And I’m not sure how to process my feelings in this exact moment. While I feel strong on most days – I do not on this day. But we keep moving forward. I keep moving forward. Because if I don’t – then he really does get the final say. ♥️

Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. 
People say men get farther in life because they speak their mind, don’t hold back, take initiative and tell people what’s up. 
When women point out the discrepancies and unfairness in men holding the majority of power, people will cite some of the above reasons: “oh sweetie, it’s just because men are more assertive, maybe if you spoke up more you could be where they are”. Ok fine then, let’s give it a shot. 
A woman finally works up the courage to do just that and call people on their bullshit and be assertive. What kind of reception does this get? “Um I think you need to chill, you’re being a bitch”
“I kind of think you’re overreacting”
“Maybe you should just take a hint”
“I see why you’re single now”
“Are you PMSing right now?”
“Don’t upset her, she’s a feisty little one”
“Woah, don’t get so defensive, it was just a joke”
“If you make a big deal about this, it’s just going to cause more problems, you don’t really want that, do you?”
“Wow, she really went on a little tangent there”
“What’s got your parties in a bunch?” You wonder why women feel repressed? You wonder why we don’t speak our minds as much? You wonder why we are so god damn angry at the patriarchy?? THIS! ALL OF THIS (and more!)! Bottom line, men are rewarded for being vocal and standing up for themselves, while women are patronized and seen as too emotional and unhinged. 
Nevertheless, you can’t let this stop you. If you use me, fuck me over or disrespect me, you’re gonna know. I will NEVER apologize for standing up for myself regardless of if you think that makes me a bitch or not. 
Heaven forbid a woman present herself as anything more than an agreeable, pleasant side kick.

Ironically enough, I’ll get shit just for this post from some people, commenting on my “rant” and asking me if “I’m ok” lol can’t a woman just speak her fucking mind every once in a while without someone giving them shit??

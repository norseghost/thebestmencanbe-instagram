The quote above is from the story we published yesterday.  In Ethiopia, many women are scared of their husbands and partners. Sexual abuse and physical abuse against pregnant Ethiopian women by their partner is very prevalent. Specifically, out of 612 pregnant Ethiopian women who were interviewed, 362 of them faced sexual and physical abuse by their husband. Many Ethiopian women who have been abused by their partner hesitate to speak out, because of a fear being finically unstable and criticized by society. Making a decision to stay in marriage where abuse became the prevalent, Ethiopian women are more likely to give birth to an abnormal child. #MeTooEthiopia is created to provide rights and voice for those who their rights are ignored and abused. Please support Ethiopians who are abused their partner by signing the #MeTooEthiopia petition. By signing the petition you are providing neglected Ethiopians with path to equal rights, while  preventing sexual abuse from being happening in our community.

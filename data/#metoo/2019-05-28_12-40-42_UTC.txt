Learning about the disparaging outcome concerning violations #harveyweinstein committed and the unethical outcome allowed within our judicial system for predators and an additional roadblock to women speak up and reject abuse.  Due to the outcome it may cause triggers and you may ahead tears because if it, but just know it’s okay and the tears allow you to cleanse. In times like this talk to someone you trust about how you’re feeling, speak positively to your truth and find ways to help push the needle on ways you can help support change in your state.  Giving back is always a way to grow stronger and healthier within recovery of emotional triggers. .

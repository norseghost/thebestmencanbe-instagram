#WisdomWednesday There is no shame in self-care. In a world that's quick to dismiss those who can't speak up, I believe every person I help empower to live a healthier life of self-care is further empowered to change the status quo. The more we love ourselves, the more confidently we will advocate for ourselves. We are all works in progress, and it's ok to not be perfect - be kind to yourself and those around you, and together we'll change the world.

I was unprepared!\u2063\n\u2063\nFor years, I joked about them being my puppies; they were always wriggling into my lap and then running off to leave muddy paw prints somewhere. \u2063\n\u2063\nThese days, I call them my satellites - constantly in orbit around me, constantly checking in for many hugs and lots of kisses, constantly inviting me into their vibrant, busy world. \u2063\n\u2063\n(Like when Mack made this bed on the floor of their room yesterday and was just beside himself for me to climb in. I\u2019m massively pregnant and I knew if I got down there on the floor, I would just have to live there the rest of my days, so we compromised and I sat in the rocking chair and read to them while they pretended we were camping under the stars.)\u2063\n\u2063\nRaising boys feels so fraught these days, doesn\u2019t it? Last month, I had the chance to interview Dr. Michael Reichert about his new book \u201cHow to Raise a Boy\u201d on @sortaawesomeshow That book, you guys!! I can\u2019t stop talking about how necessary and helpful it is for anyone looking for insight in navigating the dynamics of our #MeToo awareness culture. Even if you don\u2019t have time to read the book, go listen to that interview. Game changer. \u2063\n\u2063\nAnd I\u2019ll just be over here, soaking up the snaggle-toothed grins and greetings of \u201cMAMAAAA\u201d when I open the front door and listening to the elaborate Marvel Universe/Minecraft crossovers all summer long."

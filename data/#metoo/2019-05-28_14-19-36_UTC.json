                        "text": "In 2016, around this time, I met a hiker who sexually assaulted me and, turns out, multiple other women. It\u2019s taken three years for me to feel like I\u2019ve taken my mountains, my safe place, back. I still scan the face of every hiker I pass, scared it\u2019s him, and I\u2019m reluctant to stop and have conversations with any hiker anymore. I stop to let people pass me, because passing people makes me feel incredibly exposed. However, I\u2019m finally starting to feel safe in the mountains again, and I\u2019m thankful that despite something terrible happening to me in them, they\u2019re still an immense source of healing. I\u2019ve been depressed and anxious six ways from Sunday lately, and it hit me today why: Trauma anniversaries can have a very deep impact without being obviously apparent. I\u2019m thankful for a therapist I can bombard all weekend and friends who I know remember this time in my life. If you\u2019ve got a trauma anniversary, take care of yourself. The feelings that come up can be as traumatic as when the event happened. Meanwhile, this authentic smile gives me hope that I can someday feel 100% safe in my happy place again. #hikingwithdogs #optoutside #hiking #colorado #metoo"

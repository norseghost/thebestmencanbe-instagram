The people who care about you will want to help you in this situation and won't see you as a burden. Make sure you find someone to talk to who you can trust.

1.  Find somewhere private and quiet where you know you're not going to get interrupted
ðŸ’­
2. Write a list of everything you want to say to your friend/family because it can be overwhelming and you might forget to say something important
ðŸ’­
3. Make it clear whether you want them to help you or just to listen to you

4. Don't expect your friend to have all the answers so we recommend seeking professional support. You can go to our Directory to find your local support network - www.standtall.org/directory

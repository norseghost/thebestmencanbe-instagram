If you don't feel like hearing about this, just remember all of the uterus possessing people everywhere who are forced to hear about this.
Before you decide whether someone gets an abortion or not, ask yourself these questions:
â€¢Is it my body?- No- not your choice
Yes- it's your choice
That's it. That's the only thing you should be concerned about. If you need more convincing as to why the abortion bans are an awful idea, feel free to dm me or comment

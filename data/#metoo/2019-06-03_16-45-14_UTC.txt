Round One:

#MotherEarth, #FatherSky, #Taíno of my heart, Ohlone of the West, Páez of the South, Kongo of the East, Anishnaabe of the North, I ask for your guidance in decolonizing and seeking #reparations.

#Ohlone, our westernmost relations, sharing fertile grounds with the Miwok, the Pomo, the Patwin, and the Yokut who still struggle for meaningful recognition and reparations.

#Páez, our southern neighbors, along with the Kichua, the Kuna, the Aymara, and thousands more original peoples who came face to face with the Spanish, the Portuguese, the French, the Dutch, and the British, survived their violence, and still survive today.

#Kongo of the East, who crossed the seas by force along with the Yoruba, the Ashanti, the Tamil, the Bengali, the Hakka, our African and Desi and Chinese relations who share our lands and blood, having lost theirs to colonizers and sometimes kin.

#Anishnaabe, our northern relations, who like the Haudenosaunee, the Great Sioux, and the Pawnee walked across waters, prairies, and mountains to preserve traditions and dream new songs for their children's children's children, I ask you for guidance in decolonizing and seeking reparations for us, the daily #survivors of #genocide.

Premise and Promise:

I've been dreaming of prayers for decolonization and reparations. As climate catastrophes happen in all corners of the planet, prayer and direct political action seem wise remedies. A prayer, to me, is a song that enters consciousness from the spirit realms. It has frequency and vibration.

Pop stars are often spiritual messengers. People like me who enter business communities despite opposition and our better judgment, pop off too. We burst the bubble of colonialism, misogyny, and capitalism. #SeAcabaronLasPromesas.

Is this my favorite cake? Nope. But is it better than NO cake? Yep. That's how I'm going into this 11th week of no running bc of my #TFL 🤪 If I can't do my fave (🏃‍♀️) I'll do the next best thing and bike. Its better than nothing right?? This cake is still delicious and decadent, just like 🚴‍♀️ can still help build my fitness and make me break a sweat 😁 #perspective #injuredrunner #cakemetaphor #imissrunning #happybirthdaymom

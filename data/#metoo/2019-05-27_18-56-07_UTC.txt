Every achievement is a servitude. It compels us to a higher achievement. When you set your mind to achieve something, you must allow yourself the opportunity to get it done. Only those who attempt the absurd can achieve the impossible. Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. #SoniaMajeed  #unwomen #GlobalGoals #wethepeople #ramadan2019 #MessengerofHumanity #Weareallhumanity #greendenlife #ShesAGirlFirst #wethepeople #RAYAcademySwiss #education #womenempowerment #DubaiAMLife #MyBodyisMyBody #heforshe #girlsup #shesthefirst #happiness #dubai #mydubai  #dubailifestyle #abudhabi #uae #GOGOJeans #MakingHERstory #metoo #love My #fans N #followers

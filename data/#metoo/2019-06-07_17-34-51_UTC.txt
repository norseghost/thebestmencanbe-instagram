Itâ€™s not easy to be a female in a male dominated industry, itâ€™s not easy to be born a Latina and coming all by yourself to the USA for working hard from scratch to build your music path. The road has been filled with fake people, betrayal, exploitation, and passive aggressive acts... But I have learned to never stop dreaming, and to always believe in myself. ðŸ˜Ž .

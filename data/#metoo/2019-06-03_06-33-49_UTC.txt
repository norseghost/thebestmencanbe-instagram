You may like their work but not their personality after reading this compelling book, Focus: the secret, sexy, sometimes sordid world of fashion photographers (2016) by Michael Gross. I think it came out before #metoo broke but it starts presciently, ominously, with tales of sexually transgressive behaviour by Terry Richardson who always imbued his models with an aura of sluttishness anyway. Anyone heard of him lately? Hope it stays that way...

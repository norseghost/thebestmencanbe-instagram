This specific lesson hits very close to home, as it was what eventually inspired Stop the Shaming to come about at all. When taught, this lesson is sexist, homophobic, incomplete, and all around shameful. No good has come out of these lessons, and no good will come out of these lessons in the future. This is very real, and is likely happening within your district. Keep this junk out of our schools! #SRAisAbstinenceOnly #stoptheshaming #sexed

“Our intimacy was intense, and satisfying although over much more quickly than I would have liked. If it had been up to
me we would have spent the rest of our night there on that picnic table, but circumstances both physically and logistically dictated that it be quick.

It seemed like an eternity that I lay there just staring deeply into the night sky.” Candy Apple Butterscotch: A Memoir Available now! #fourstars #memoir #metoo #ptsdsurvivor “It’s WORTH THE READ It’s about a #woman #empowered and my God that is a #wonderful thing indeed” #linkinbio #authorsofinstagram #independentpublishing #goodreads #newbookalert #readforFREE #writingcommunity

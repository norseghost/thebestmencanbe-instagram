An investigation by a London-based  non-profit organisation, Korea Future Initiative (KFI) has reported that young girls, sometimes as young as 12, are being raped and forced to participate in cybersex, and were even said to be treated incorrectly, often by starving these women. 
The NGO has claimed that North Korean women are in demand because of the low charges for their bodies. It can be as little as $4 for prostitution services and $146 for a wife. "At a time when significant global capital is invested in China and, more recently, political capital expended on North Korea, it is a damning indictment that North Korean women and girls are left languishing in the sex trade," the organization said.
"Condemnation is insufficient. Only tangible acts can dismantle China's sex trade, confront a North Korean regime that abhors women, and rescue sex slaves scattered across brothels, remote townships, and cybersex dens in mainland China." Source: CNN. ~AP

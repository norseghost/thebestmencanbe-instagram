Welcome to The Alabama Horror Story: ⠀
⠀
"The measure bans abortions at all stages of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape and/or incest. The only time an abortion would be legal in Alabama is if the mother's health is at risk. The law also includes punitive measures for doctors. Performing an abortion is now classified as a Class A felony punishable by up to 99 years in prison, and an attempt to provide an abortion would be a Class C felony that could land a doctor with up to 10 years in prison." ⠀
⠀
The Alabama Horror Story isn't at all entertaining. If someone had to write a review, it would read "We need a petition to stop this fresh hell!" And so, that's what we're doing. Join us - together our voices are louder and more shrill, someone WILL LISTEN. ⠀
⠀
LET'S BRING BACK FREEDOM OF CHOICE, ASAP, LIKE, YESTERDAY ALREADY. ⠀

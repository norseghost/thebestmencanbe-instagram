Back in the old days black boxes were used to thinly hide identity of a subject in newspaper and tabloid type of publications in the world. 
However, in the early 80's in Iran a peculiar type of fashion was trending by the tabloid distributors. A black marker was used over women's exposed body parts such as the hands and the neck in order to cover them up before selling the magazines. Most of these female models appeared as if wearing turtle necks.
“Modesty is a part of faith and too much exposure rots the brain.”

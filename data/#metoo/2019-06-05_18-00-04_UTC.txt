hey. i know that you don’t know me. at all. but i want to tell you. i see you. i know youre struggling. i want to help you. you will never be alone in any battle even if it feels like it. there are people who struggle through the same things that you go through. you can text me anytime you need too. sometimes talking to someone you trust is easier than talking to a stranger and sometimes it’s the opposite way for some people. it all depends on the person. my friend, @aannamarieramirez , has helped me through my battle and my struggle. no one is alone in their battle. ever. i love you and i care about you and your mental state. #yourenotalone #iseeyou #suicideprevention #iloveyou #mentalhealthquotes #metoo #struggle 
KEEP IN MIND I AM NOT A MENTAL HEALTH EXPERT!! JUST A PERSON WANTING TO HELP OTHERS!!

Faith in My Fear
You taught me some 
lessons that I had to learn,
each year in the passing 
my freedom was burned.
I got in the flames,
like a witch to the stake.
I was burning alive,
in all that self hate. 
At one point in time 
I had mistaken my fate,
for the sentence of life
without love or true ways. 
I held myself captive in
the ways I had learned,
but still I searched freely 
through the pain and the
hurt. 
My Dear I see clearly 
that the flames were the cure,
for in your heart dearly 
I found Faith in my Fear.

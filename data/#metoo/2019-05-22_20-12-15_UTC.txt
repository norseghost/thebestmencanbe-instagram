Last year in the "civilized" country of Ireland a raped woman was questioned for her underwear choices. This is why we need feminism all over the world and not just in third world countries like sadly some men I know personally have said to me. Rape is rape. There is nothing more or less to that statement. I believe she had been wearing a blue lace thong (or that's just the one I saw pictured) well, on the right is an example of the type of underwear I was wearing when I was raped. Rapists are not committing an act of sex, they are committing an act of violence, so how sexy you are percieved to be doesn't matter. No one asks to be raped. #killyourlocalrapist #standwithher #metoo #ibelieveher #ibelieveherireland #underwearisnotconsent #consentissexy #art #artshare #feministart #feminist #feminism #womanart #womenart #womensupportingwomen #nomeansno #artsharing #markerart #prismacolorart #winnipegartist #winnipegart #rapeculture #whyineedfeminism

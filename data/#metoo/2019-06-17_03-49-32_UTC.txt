SHE SAID 
Book, Music and Lyrics by Lily Ali-Oshatz / Piano Arrangements by Mark Galinovsky / Directed by Madeline Wall 
She Said chronicles one person's experience with rape and her choice to report the crime. Using poetry, storytelling and original music, this one person musical is a call to action and a reminder that our laws cannot be changed until we change our culture. Only then can we begin to hope.

I would still be miserable. The guy made me cry daily and it was a sexless marriage for majority. He would do these fake suicide attempts with a knife to his neck even in front of my daughter. He beat up my baby brother very badly... my baby bro is my best friend. He would always hide how much money he made. And he would always play the victim. Making me think I needed to protect him even though he was destroying me. He even threw things at me while I was driving and he was in the passenger seat. I truly believe if I didn’t leave when I did I would have been dead the next month either I would have killed myself or he would have killed me. 
Finally, I’m at a place where I can say this. I’m brave enough to tell it out. And if anyone needs ears to listen to their stories or needs a voice for advocacy... I’m here. 
I have to give a shout of to @humblethepoet ... chapter 54 just woke something in me that was ready to finally talk.

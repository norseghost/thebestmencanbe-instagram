Got myself a locker in the High Court library as Iâ€™ll be in full nerd burger research mode working on a very exciting #metoo related project that Iâ€™ll announce soon! In the meantime Iâ€™ll be practicing my selfie game (which Iâ€™ve been told needs some improvement...) and covering my locker in RBG stickers ðŸ¤“ #law #research #lawyersofinstagram #metoo

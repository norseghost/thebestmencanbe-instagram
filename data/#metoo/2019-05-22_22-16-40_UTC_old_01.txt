I’ve learned so many valuable lessons from @reclaimyourvoice , one of the major ones being mindfulness around the language we choose. A man was preparing to share his story at one of our events, and I sent him a list of prompts to assist with the writing process. One of the prompts said something that included the phrase “your abuser”. When the man got up to share his story, he specifically pointed that out and said, “He was 𝘵𝘩𝘦 abuser. He wasn’t 𝘮𝘺 abuser. That word ties me to him and I am not tied to him.” I never used that phrase again. ⁣⁣⁣

Healing and reclaiming our power consist of a series of steps, some of them as small but as significant as changing the words we use to frame our experiences.⁣⁣⁣

The word “my” works for some people, but for me it felt freeing to release it.⁣⁣⁣

He wasn’t 𝘮𝘺 abuser. He isn’t 𝘮𝘺 ex. He isn’t 𝘮𝘺 anything. ⁣⁣⁣

There is strength in my blood but not in my silence.\nAround this time I would\u2019ve been starting to prepare an announcement to let you know that we were expecting, but the universe had other plans for us as it usually does. At around 8 weeks we found out the pregnancy was not viable. It was, of course, devastating news.  Instead of waiting for a natural miscarriage to occur I decided to take Misoprostol, the drug that forces an abortion. It was the most physically and emotionally painful experience of my life thus far. The grief surrounding this loss has been unexpected, unfamiliar and just plain tough.\n.\nWhy do I tell you this?\nBecause the only thing that has comforted me during this past month of grief was knowing other women\u2019s stories, knowing how common this was within my community of sisters.\n.\nWhy do I tell you this?\nTo break down the shame and stigma around one of the most common occurrences women have. \nIt makes my heart hurt too much to know that most women are suffering in silence.\n.\nWhy do I tell you this?\nWe all know what the climate is like around our reproductive systems currently. \nWe must be vocal and let our experiences and beliefs be known.\nWe are in charge of our own bodies.\n.\nMaybe sharing this is a part of my healing journey. Maybe I know and feel the suffering of my sisters behind closed doors. If this can comfort just one person it was worth it.  Sharing some wide open venerability in this plastic non reality social media forum.\n.\nI\u2019m not ashamed. My body is strong. Our bodies are strong.\nWe are the life giving force. I will not be silent in my grief.\nWe shall not be silent.\n\n#metoo #miscarriagetruth #ourbodiesourchoice"

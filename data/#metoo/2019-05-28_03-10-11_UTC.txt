Challenge 117: Prehistoric - Prehistoric Medieval Mentality 👎🧠🤴👑🌱💎💰⚔️✝️For this challenge in the height of recent events with these states signing the anti-abortion bills with this prehistoric ways of thinking…I felt like I had to represent that in this challenge instead of doing a streight forward interpretation. These laws are bringing us as a society backwards when whatever men or the church says goes, when men ruled women and their choices and voices, when the church abused women and didn’t give them the same rights as any other human being and treated them as wombs and property instead of people in a country whose suppose to have freedom from religious rule. In this illustration I wanted to convey that in a medieval style that was drawn like in the old biblical texts and manuscripts using the same color palette and thick ink lines. I am hoping for a better future where women, ALL women, get the rights back to their own body parts, and this oppression to end as a woman’s life also matters and nobody should ever choose what’s best for that individual unless you are that individual. ✌️🙏🙅‍♀️

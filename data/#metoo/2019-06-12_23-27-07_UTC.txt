Take a look at this Film that we Created For our Client ! link is in the Bio if your looking for more content like this ! GO SUPPORT !! The Silver Maple is one of the most common trees in the eastern and central United States. Though it has higher sunlight requirements than other maples, it is considered a highly adaptable tree. They can grow to a towering 100-feet tall, but are surprisingly fragile as their soft wood is prone to storm damage.
Featuring long, slender stalks the leaves of the Silver Maple are simple, yet intriguing. The lightest breeze can produce a striking effect, exposing the downy silver undersides. During an approaching storm the tree can completely transform, turning from green to an a prominent shiny silver.
Our story, and the stories of survivors, are rooted in this depiction of the Silver Maple. Survivors are incredibly adaptable and capable of adjusting to a myriad of conditions. On the outside, they may appear strong and independent; on the inside, they can be soft and vulnerable. These qualities are important to who they are, though we never see them as frail.
The ability for survivors to perceive danger, even in the slightest, is a skill honed by their experience. Their ability to alter their mood and presentation can be both captivating and confusing for others. We know all too well these qualities make survivors complex and beautiful.
Silverleaf Sexual Trauma Recovery Services exists to believe, support, and encourage survivors in their journey, from surviving to thriving. We are here to weather the storm with them.

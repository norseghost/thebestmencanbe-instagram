Its statistically very likely that you’ve experienced some sort of event in your life - be it abuse, a traumatic incident, an assault - and the number of us that have not experienced something in this realm is unfortunately low. This means two things:⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1) YOU ARE NOT ALONE. When we’ve been through life altering experiences like these, we can feel a whole host of emotions like shame, guilt, anger, sadness, confusion, and loneliness. These emotions can convince us to stay silent out of fear. But let me tell you right now, #metoo, and you most definitely are not alone.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
2) Our collective human experience is one of trauma. But here is the light at the end of that tunnel, we can experience an immense amount of compassion for others when we understand what they are enduring. We’ve been there, we are there, and we know the emotions and body sensations that are experienced during and after trauma. This is empathy. This is WE.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

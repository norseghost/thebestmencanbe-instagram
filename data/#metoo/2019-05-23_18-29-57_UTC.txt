Women are not to be controlled or regulated. 
Women are sacred vessels that sustain, nurture, sacrifice, surrender and birth LIFE. 
Regardless of our choice to pro create or not we are to be revered. 
To be celebrated. 
To be respected. 
We are powerful
Sexual
Creators. 
We embody a softness that nurtures, a sweetness that draws you closer, a fierceness that protects, and a capacity to open ourselves to multiple folds of manifesting simultaneously.

I haven't been into jewelry for a while, but I just couldn't resist when I saw what @avys_ricco had made! 
After sexual assaults, some women do what they can to hide themselves (no makeup, over-sized clothing, no jewelry). For years, I found myself going in and out of these phases, depending on the kind of triggers I had. 
I had no idea that I had this habit, until this past year when I thoughtfully hid myself in public (although I gathered the energy to maybe once a month to make myself fancy). @avys_ricco had supported me from Japan throughout my healing journey in Canada and Spain, and I can honestly feel the loving energy that she puts into her work. 
She helped me to pick out the best designs for my energy, and outfit, and boosted my confidence! 
Please check out her shop, like and support! ❤️ #trauma #traumatherapy #metoo #writingtherapy #traveltherapy #travel #islands #subtropical #araha #arahabeach #mentalhealth #mentalhealthcheck #overcome #transformation #confident #handmadejewelry #handmade #okinawa #japan #沖縄 #日本 #アラハ #各位 #宝石

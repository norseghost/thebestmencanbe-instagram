If you are in the #gwinnett county area, make sure you go out to the FUN-raiser this Saturday night (06/08) to Boulder Creek Coffee in Downtown Lawrenceville!!
â€”â€”â€”
Here you will find open mic night, some good coffee, and a wonderful opportunity to support local students + organizations. What @worldpeaceconnection & @impact46_inc does is absolutely wonderful. Theyâ€™re taking 2 graduated Central Gwinnett students to COLUMBIA for a crazy amazing cross cultural leadership experience - AND on top of that, @danecaston will be performing!

Donâ€™t miss it! Tag your friends & family and make sure you drop by. ðŸŒ·

The affects of pregnancy on a woman’s body is tremendous. The affects of an unwanted pregnancy even more so. I can speak first hand about the mental trauma and irreparable damage it causes. Terminating a pregnancy is never "just a convenience". It is saving your mind; your body; and sometimes your life. It is taking responsibility. It is saying ‘I cannot carry to term, and that’s ok’. It is my choice when or if I procreate. No amount of sex changes that. There is no waiver signed. We don’t give automatic consent to bear a pregnancy when we say yes to sex. Forcing a woman to carry against her will, will always be sexual slavery. You don’t get to control a woman’s organs. Because once you control her uterus, it’s an easy decend to controlling her other body parts. Her vagina perhaps? Now we are touching the area of legalised rape..... There is a reason for bodily autonomy. Rape is illegal for the same reason abortion is legal. You cannot, and should not control another person’s body. No one, born or otherwise, has the right to use someone’s body without their continuous consent. And like with sex, consent can be withdrawn.

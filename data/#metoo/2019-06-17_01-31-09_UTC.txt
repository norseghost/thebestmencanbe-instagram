That Rockies and Padres series was amazing. I don’t think ive ever seen anything like it and I loved it. Charlie Blackmon was setting record in style. The two teams set a record for most points in a series. Blackmon had 4 homeruns, scores 9 times, had 10 RBIS and 15 hits by himself. The pitching was not good for either team but the hitting was unbelievable. I usually don’t rewatch games that happened the day before but in this case so had to the games were just soo good.

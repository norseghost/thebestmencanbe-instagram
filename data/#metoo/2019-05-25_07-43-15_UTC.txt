After four amazing years in Coventry and building great relationships with lectures and friends, I got the chance to understand photography in ways I never did as a student in A-levels but now has become part of who I am. I use photography as a way to remember moments in which do not forever exist once passed but exist within the archival world of photographs. Pursuing a voice on behalf of me and others, telling stories and creating conversation is what I appreciate most about photography as my main practice.

I thank all of those who have supported me through the last four years and believed in me. Photography and Coventry will forever be a part of my life. .

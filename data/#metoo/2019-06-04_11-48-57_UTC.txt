Itâ€™s taken me a while to get my head around this cause I was hoping it was â€˜fake newsâ€™... but alas itâ€™s true. And with no exception for rape or incest ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡?? How the hell did we get here?? Just when the #metoo movement was making some changes & creating a safe space for women to talk about their experiences with abuse of power (sexually or via bullying), we take a step back to the dark ages! These 3 examples show that there is still such a long way to go ðŸ˜”. And seeing the faces of the men (all men) in Alabama that voted for this, I guarantee you these same men are pro guns (happy to be corrected tho)... I am not pro abortion but Iâ€™m #prochoice & I am truly sad ðŸ˜ž

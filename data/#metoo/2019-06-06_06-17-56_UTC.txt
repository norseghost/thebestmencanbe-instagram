My GIRLS and EQUALITY

I have been thinking about this for some time and wondering how to express it.

As a father to three wonderful little girls and now a baby boy, I get it. I see how gender equality truly does NOT exist....and will not for a very long time.

The amount of people, from all races, cultures and religions (not just Asians) that have commented on @boosfood and I having a boy ‘completing’ our family is ludicrous. People do not believe that we didn’t keep having kids because we just wanted four!  They state that our family name can be carried on. That I must be happy to have a son so I can do ‘boy’ things with him.

It frustrates me.

A name is carried on in terms of the legacy of who they become as a person. My wife doesn’t use her maiden name any more but carries on that name in terms of how she conducts and represents herself and her parents.

Having a son hasn’t completed me. Having a fourth child has. I would have been just as happy having a fourth daughter. 
Being a parent isn’t about doing the things you enjoy it’s about doing the things your kids enjoy. If playing princesses makes my girls smile (which it does) I will damn well be a princess (Jasmine for those of you that may ask). I do it because it puts the biggest smile on their faces.

Until we as a society stop seeing these differences then women will never get an equal shot. 
We are going to bring our son up understanding the above....and he better be prepared to play princesses! #gender #equality #genderequality #women #femaleempowerment #metoo #sexist #sexualequality #society #power #success

                        "text": "Born in 1910 in Mexico City, Matilde Soto Landeta was sent to San Luis Potosi at age 4 when her mother died, to be raised by her aunt and grandmother. They eventually sent her back to Mexico City, to a strict religious school the family hoped might \"cure\" little Matilde's habit of constantly questioning authority and \"bossing\" everyone around.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nAfter seeing a film for the first time as a girl, she decided, against all \"reasonable\" advice, that she would be a film director. She began playing director with her brothers and other children, even hitting \"her actors\" when they failed to follow orders.\n\nAfter seeing a poor family picking grains of rice off the street where they'd spilled from a passing truck, Soto wept and begged her family to give their money to the poor. This, along with the other traits listed above, is a typical behavior of a highly gifted child, or genius. \nSoto's first film job was as a makeup artist. She wanted to direct but the director's union, all men, said it was not allowed. She persisted. And persisted. She sold her family's cars and mortgaged their house to pay for her first film. It was so good no one could deny she was born to be a director anymore.\n\nSoto became one of the top directors during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, and her films all told stories of strong, smart women who rose up against the repression of patriarchy.\n\nSay her name.\n\nLearn more about her in my forthcoming book, KNOW US BY OUR NAMES: 100 INFLUENTIAL LATINAS WHO CHANGED THE WORLD, coming Sept. 23 from Eugenia Books.\n\n#Mexico \n#revolution\n#film\n#womeninfilm\n#director\n#ownvoices\n#Latina\n#womensrights\n#womenshistory \n#latinas \n#hispanic \n#history\n#feminist\n#feministart \n#metoo\n#bookstagram"

Shout by Laurie Halse Anderson is not an easy book to read because it is her personal memoir involving rape at age 13, trauma, poverty, and family struggles but it is an important book. (Also one of @projectlitcomm's 19-20 picks!) Her heartbreaking realistic fiction book Speak about a similar topic was published 20 years ago but still resonates today. Read them both. #MsSterlingReads #shout #lauriehalseanderson #speak #metoo #justreadit #projectlit

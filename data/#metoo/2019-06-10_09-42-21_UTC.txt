Coercive control, lack of financial independence, social and religious conditioning are three of the main reasons abused women can't just LEAVE abusive marriages. It's not enough to encourage victims of domestic violence to "just leave". Many women left but yet were still stalked, tracked down and killed by these men! What should we say to these women? Abi just leave? Telling victims to DV to just leave doesn't change the fact that the husband is an abuser who will go unpunished. Accountability and consequences should be attached to cases of abuse. If you want women to just leave abusive marriages, please provide safety for them and encourage the law enforcement to be accountable for the times they ignore domestic violence.

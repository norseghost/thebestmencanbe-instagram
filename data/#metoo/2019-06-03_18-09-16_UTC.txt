We’re facing problems on all fronts: environmental calamities, sexual harassment and bullying in corporate environments, inhumane work conditions in global manufacturing, sexual assault in religious environments, and a constitutional crisis in the White House.  I commend California for enabling women’s leadership, because women have the wisdom and compassion necessary to change things.  In the words of the Dalai Lama: “The world will be saved by the Western woman.” #buddhism #dalailama #feminism #womenempowerment #metoo

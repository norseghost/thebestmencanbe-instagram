My mother poisoned me by saying this and I believe it for a couple decades but she was wrong.  My sister is smart, intelligent and bright.  She took me in after I attempted suicide my second time.  I am forever grateful for that. ðŸ‘­ #sistersister #verbalabuse #ptsdawarenessmonth @imachildabusesurvivor

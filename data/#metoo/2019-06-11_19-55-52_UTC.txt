So many times we have been hurt, we have been accused of being someone we are not, we have been lied to and lead on, we have been talked down to, we have been used and we have been stabbed in the back by so many. 
We have seen the very definition of Hell On Earth. 
And still here we are. We are kind, we are loving, we are accepting and supportive. We are brave, passionate, determined, selfless. 
And we are so much more then these few words we could fit into this photo. 
We are so much more than what can be seen. We have so much to show the world and so much to offer it.
We have a story to tell. A story that others me read or listen to and within our experiences maybe others will see themselves and know they are not alone in this life. - The Eyre Manor System -

“Being biologically related doesn't always make people your family. Anyone who abuses you in any way be it physical, emotional, mental, or sexual is not a member of your family.  The word family means the people who love you unconditionally.” Wise words from Elizabeth Smart for anyone that might need to hear this today.

Regarding adoption, we seem to get that biology does not make your family, but we don’t seem to understand or accept this in other situations. We need to. So today celebrate the people that love you unconditionally. 💞

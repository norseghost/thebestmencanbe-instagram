Have you seen me? The experiences I had while creating this hand drawn series of several animal species was like nothing else. I can’t explain how I feel other than the micro stories that exist within. A symbolist at heart. ironic how I became silenced and yet my drawing style of collaged information and emotion... is now known. Goodbye Animals was bought by over 500 Stores and was available worldwide for sale. Now I’ve taken the series back from the world - so if you see it anywhere please #saysomething #artistsofinsta #elephantart #goodbyeelephant #lizashart #wwf #lizashllc #indianeleph #endangeredspecies #newnow #metoo #whereswaldo #handdrawn #inkandpaper #finds #contest #mindgames ...what do you see? if these creatures could speak what would they say? Would we even listen?

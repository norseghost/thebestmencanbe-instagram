In the aftermath of a sexual assault or rape, survivors can face extremely difficult and painful emotions and experiences. ☝ Every survivor responds to traumatic events in their own way. The effects of the trauma can be short-term or last long after the sexual assault or rape. •

🛑Survivors of sexual assault 🛑deserve respect. Survivors also deserve access to the full range of health services and support — including emergency contraception, rape kits, STD testing, and abortion. Let’s work together to create a culture of consent, and support survivors.

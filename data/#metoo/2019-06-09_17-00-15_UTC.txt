It’s suppose to rain this afternoon so I’m gonna relax and enjoy a couple of tea and do some puzzles ☔️ 🌹 🥀 ☕️ 🍵 #healingvibes #shepersisted #ptsdawareness #notalone #metoo #ptsd #ptsdrecovery #ptsdsurvivor #anxiety #anxietysupport #recovery #realrecovery #depression #mentalhealth #mentalillness #mentalhealthawareness #domesticviolence #naturephotography #nevergiveup #believesurvivors #traumarecovery #healing #selflove #selfcare #flowers #nature #pokemon #pokemongo #trauma

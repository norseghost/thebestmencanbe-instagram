1. I’m not sorry for cancelling dinner plans late because therapy was so intense I left not able to speak. 2. I’m not sorry I didn’t apologize afterwards to the person I cancelled on. I told her something had come up and she was still upset three weeks later and made all sorts of accusations about me and all of us having things going on including playing the who had it worse game. 3. I’m not sorry I took care of myself. #ptsd #metoo #domesticabuse #depression #mentalillness #therapy #therapyhangover #sorrynotsorry #healing #reclaimhope #selfcare

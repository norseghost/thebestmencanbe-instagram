The #monumentquilt to honor survivors of #sexualviolence is extraordinary, moving, beautiful, impactful! If youâ€™re in the #DC area, tomorrow is the last day to see it in its entirety at the National mall. Congrats and thanks @upsettingrapeculture for your six years of work to make it happen! #notalone #metoo

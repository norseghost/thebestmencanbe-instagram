#ICYMI, @DenverPopCultureCon is anything but a boys club. In addition to the powerful female #cosplay representation, this year’s Con showcased author panelists including @daciamarnold and C.R. Richards, who discussed why it was important to talk about #MeToo at the convention. And on site to demo games was developer Alicia Poon from Boulder-based @serenityforge.studio, one of the growing number of women working in game development and design as well as the industry’s journey toward gender inclusion.

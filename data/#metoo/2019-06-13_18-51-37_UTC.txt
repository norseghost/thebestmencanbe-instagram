4/5 Buffaloes from Buffalo Rising! .
"...Yeah, it’s immersive, intense, and in your face, and it’s a play that will stay with you...
. ...See, GIRLS WHO WALKED ON GLASS is not a hash tag movement, it’s not a protest march, it’s not a social media rant, it’s a work of art – a play that wrestles with difficult and divisive issues in a way that embraces complexity and encourages empathy...
. ... The short survey also asks which scene resonated with you the most and for me it was the ending which was very busy but I was lucky enough to be standing near Emily Yancey whose character was making a phone call. At one point she paused, and my heart just melted, because I knew what had happened on the other end during that pause..."

Thank you for your attendance and review, Peter Hall! ☺️

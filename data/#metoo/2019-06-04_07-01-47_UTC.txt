I’m so happy to hear that many people take some comfort from the words I post. 
If you’re quietly watching, know that you are important. That you matter. That, even though you may not be in a place to feel it right now, you have many skills to offer. 
Hold on and know that acute, intense feelings shift and change. You will find peace again ❤️#mentalwellbeing #mentalhealth #itsokaynottobeokay #weallhaveit #metoo #depression #anxiety #occupationaltherapy #holdon #practicalmindset

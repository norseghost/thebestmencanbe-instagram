For me, “Seams” is about hope! Hope of healing. Hope of making it another day. Hope that we can learn from our mistakes, forgive ourselves and do better!⁣
⁣
In an era of “me too” we find ourselves at a crossroads: continue this violence or heal. ⁣
As men, we’ve been raised to fear vulnerability and hide from ourselves. Raised by men who were raised by men who have continued this cycle of toxic and violent behavior for generations, “Seams” is about breaking that cycle. ⁣

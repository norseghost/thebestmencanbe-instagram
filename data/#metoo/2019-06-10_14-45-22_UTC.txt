WHERE IS THE LOVE?
So just writing something about the journey towards the Misogyny Trials, starting with our mentoring in schools, book clubs, womanly words etc. 
So I started reminding myself of all the various definitions:
• Misogyny is the hatred of women.
• Misandry is the hatred of men
• Misanthropy is the hatred of human beings in general. 
That's an awful lot of hate so todays word for me is...
Philogeny. It means a fondness for, love, and admiration towards all women 
But what is the work for someone who just is crazy in love with humans?

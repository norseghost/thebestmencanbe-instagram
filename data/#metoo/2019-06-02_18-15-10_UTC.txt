HELP MAKE STRANGULATION A FELONY AND STEP PARENTS PROTECTED UNDER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS IN EVERY STATE!

Domestic Violence affects 1 in 4 women and many experience violent strangulation in front of their children. My husband did not do this to me his ex-wife did and because of this I can speak freely without fearing for my life as she does not live with me (THANK GOD!!!) Strangulation can kill you fast. My hope is by sharing my story it educates about the dangers because they are many. If you survive you stand to have lifelong injury to your body, mind and spirit. I hope my story spreads and at least one woman leaves with her children and saves her life üôè strangulation is attempted murder don‚Äôt try to talk yourself out of that. They do not love you they want to kill you and if you stay there is a 700% chance of homicide if it happened just one time!!!! #reportit #attemptedmurder

What is fibromyalgia?This is a wonderful question,which unfortunately has several answers.From a medical point of view there are many theories,many discordant,many that have points in common,many others really out of the way.What I can tell is only the point of view of those who have a severe form of fibromyalgia,forced to live in a wheelchair to have minimal autonomy and,above all,the point of view of those who are now living in the most deafening physical pain.The most amusing theory is certainly the one that claims that the fibromyalgia is a "mental disease",that pain is given purely by the bad function of the psyche,practically every fibromyalgic becomes fibromyalgic because it is depressed,but you do not allow to say that it is fibromyalgia, consequently chronic pain,that brings depression.I believe that there is so little information about it, knowing to understand, this is my motto. I've lost everything, yet I'm still here struggling, why?  I think the answer is that I wish I could help as many people as possible with my experience, but can I really do it? #fibromyalgia #chronicpain #experience #knowingtounderstand #force #help #information #mentaldisease #mentalhealth #health #iputmyface #metoo #painmask

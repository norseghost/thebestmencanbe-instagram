Morning rant - I’m super guilty of being the person everyone leans on . In the past when I need to do the leaning I literally only had my momma & my brother .  After a re-evaluation of my “friends” and a good cleaning i now feel like i have a solid support.  Look at the people you call your friends , get a better view and if someone blocking the sunlight , move they ass . Period .

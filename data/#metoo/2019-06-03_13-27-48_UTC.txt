“a women who cuts her hair is about to change her life”
Cutting my hair was very symbolic for me •
It means I am done with all the pain from my past •
It means I am letting go of the old making room for the new
•
It means that I don’t care what anybody thinks about me •
It means I love myself so deeply •
It means hair doesn’t define your beauty •
It means I am free •
It means I can do anything
•
It means women are sexy and beautiful with short hair •
It means yes I am a warrior
•
It means I can handle anything that comes my way •
It means I love myself first everything else is secondary •

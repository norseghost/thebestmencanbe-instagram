Holy shit, yâ€™all. @absfest was *incredible*
.
A thousand thank youâ€™s to everyone who was a part of this weekend adventure with me!
.
I loved getting to perform on stage with @candyboxrevue. Being a part of the #metoo performance was such a powerful moment that I was able to share with my #sparklefam and everyone in the audience.
.

#lastpastiesstanding is one of my favorite shows and getting the opportunity to be ridiculous with a rainbow megaphone on the LPS stage in Asheville with @sadieup was perfectly wild!
.

Spending the weekend in the mountains with my @polypocketsatl family was beautiful. Iâ€™m so grateful to have such a loving, supportive group of humans that will be fierce in our care for each other.
.

Iâ€™m so damn lucky to live this life I lead!

Also, #partybus .

‘Nobody’s Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls’ is one of the most disturbing and impressive books I’ve ever read. Part memoir, part analysis of how the internet facilitates new levels of depraved sexual exploitation, victim’s rights lawyer @cagoldberglaw will infuriate and activate you to join the fight against digital abuse. I’ve had horrifying experiences with cyber stalking and violence, and it was cathartic and enraging in turns to hear the stories of Goldberg’s clients. This book could have been retraumatizing in less powerful hands, but Goldberg is nothing less than a hero. A self-described “ruthless motherfucker,” she is a game changer for this world and we’re lucky to have her. #survivor #abusesurvivor #assaultsurvivor #stalking #revengeporn #feminism #readwomen #victimsrights #metoo #booksofinsta #books #booksbooksbooks #booksofig #bookstagram #bookreview #bookaholic #bookworm #booklover #booklove #saturday #saturdayreads

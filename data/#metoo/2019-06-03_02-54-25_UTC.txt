Yesterday I had a class.

At the end of the class, I told my instructor with tears in my eyes that I missed who I used to be.

He had seen me before my neck injury, and I've booked bodywork sessions with him to help me with the symptoms.

He let me hold his hand and met my gaze, and said: "In the time that I have known you, I have seen you navigate this well and I think you are doing great." So then I told him that I wish I could have a break from navigating all of this.. The trauma
The triggers
Insecurities
Crippling depression
Sensory overload
Cranial sensitivity
Mistrust of everyone around me at any time for any reason
Feeling alone and lonely and being unable to reach out most of the time until crises level is hit
Being a wall flower
Losing my exuberance
Losing my creative expression
Silencing my own voice
Being ashamed of just speaking up or trying to communicate, only to be corrected by other folx living a different story

I'm so close to jumping off into the void. It's just a matter of when my death won't be as much of a burden for others.

I'm living for you. Not for me. It's been this way for a few years.

Fancy that.

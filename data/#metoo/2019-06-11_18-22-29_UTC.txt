The #MeToo and Time’s Up movements have brought huge attention to the challenges women face at work, but a new survey finds that 60% of male managers say they’re uncomfortable participating in regular work activities with women, including mentoring, working one-on-one or socializing.⁣⠀
⁣⠀
According to the survey, released by LeanIn.org and SurveyMonkey, that’s a 33% increase from last year.⁣⠀
⁣⠀
Senior-level men also say they are 12x more likely to be hesitant about one-on-one meetings with a junior woman than they are a junior man, 9x more likely to be hesitant to travel with a junior woman for work than a junior man, and 6x more likely to be hesitant to have a work dinner with a junior woman than a junior man.⁣⠀
⁣⠀
LeanIn.org founder and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg calls the results “totally unacceptable.”⁣⠀

Driving to London this morning on a dad job - not SE1 but UX something something....
@bexlondon_perfume is a house Iâ€™ve only just discovered and I rather do like it!ðŸ‘Œ
Anyone familiar?
From the companyâ€™s website:
â€˜Evoking the atmosphere and aroma of the old Thameside spice wharfs, Londoner SE1 is alive with bergamot, citrus, cardamom and pimento balanced with a deep woody base of amber, sea moss, driftwood and finest natural Vetiver.â€™
Have a great smelling day all!ðŸ˜Š

There are many people that I speak with about herpes awareness and education, and many may be unaware, there's a common theme with a few of them. 
It's an attitude of ”why bother” and a dismissal of making any effort to make change happen. While most do not feel this way, I try to impress upon them that if they just tried a little, before giving up, they may see the possibility of making things or change happen. There is great power in numbers and if enough people join, you will see real change. This idea is quite obvious in todays environment and can be seen in movements like #metoo and the increase of female Congresswomen and senators. Maybe you shouldn't give up so easily and just give things a try.

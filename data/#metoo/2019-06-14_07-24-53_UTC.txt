Here is a doodle of a sculpture I made in a zombie plush sculpture series. The idea behind it was to help the littles in my system to talk about passing on. Gwynn is 5 years old and cries over the fact the body is getting older and she stays the same. She doesn't know what will happen to her when our body dies. So sad.  #dissociativeidentitydisorder #dissociation #dissociation #depressionkills #majordepressivedisorder #multiplepersonalities #ptsdrecovery #ptsd #ptsdawareness #complexptsd #complexptsdrecovery #metoo #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthawareness #survivor #doodle

#Repost @straighten_your_crowns  His words being so wise beyond his years and the times. Here we are having conversations that been taking place for decades. Are we going to re-visit our rights to vote, have a credit card or run in a marathon? That’s right ladies credit cards were reserved for men and married women who could have their husbands cosign on their applications until The Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 was enacted. By the 1970’s the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) finally relented and allowed certain women to run in Marathons as bogus scientific research claimed that long-distance running could cause infertility in women. If your a man, woman, LGTBQ, here in the US our rights something we should cherish because so many other countries do not have. BUT if we start to go backwards in time. Take away those very precious rights that we took for granted. We are not as advanced as we think we are. Until we are all treated as equals regardless of our sex or color and the same way a man has rights over his body a woman and only a woman should have rights over her’s. This Country was Great at one time and I do believe it can be again but only if we start moving forward. Not by undoing the laws we have but by creating new laws that are inclusive for ALL!! #mybodymychoice #stopthebans #equalrightsforall #womansrights #reallifehandmaidstale #ibelieveyou #YouAreNotAlone #SurvivorsUnite

4 Years Ago Today I Graduated from High School and was free at last 😆 High school was a tough time for me and I'm so glad I'm out of that hellhole. 🙅 🎓 #dailyinspiration #throwbacktuesday #highschooldays 
In the Past 4 Years I have Accomplished so Many Things that I Never Dreamed of Doing, including:
1. Going to college and getting (mostly) good grades
2. Working at my University's bookstore twice 📖
3. Going to Canada twice 🇨🇦
4. Living in and taking care of my own apartment
5. Switching from a Fashion Merchandising to a History major on my own accord
6. Being an active member at my school's Fitness Center, the Well. Back in high school I was mocked in P.E. for not being "athletic" enough because I was too short to play volleyball. Now I probably work out more than those people from my P.E. class do 😝 🏋️‍♀️
7. Signing petitions through change.org that are changing the world
8. Going on awesome, breathtaking Peak Adventures trips 🌲 📷
9. Going to #metoo on-campus conferences and events 
10. And last but not least having a highly entertaining Instagram account and being able to reach out to so many people around the world ☺️📱 And also to make fun of the diet industry and dumb, old men in power 😝 😅 
Now my next step is to find an actual job/career. I have no clue on exactly what I want to do and I'm totally tripping. I only have a year left of college and there is SO much pressure to find a job and/or an internship. I need to find motivation to go out and look for a job but it just gets SO overwhelming and I end up crawling back in my Crab shell. What's a girl to do? (p.s., sorry if my eyes look red in this photo: just bad camera quality)

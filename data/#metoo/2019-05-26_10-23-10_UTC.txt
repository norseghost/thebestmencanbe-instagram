Tomorrow is the day I go in to get my Mireena and curette.
.
As you know the first time I had this done was not under anesthetic and the pain was so unbearable the gyno had to remove it after laying in agony for 30min.
.
Tomorrow I'm getting put under so it's not such a shock to my body.... this is the LAST step I can take to help my pain management before the inevitable hysterectomy and I'm having serious anxiety that it's going to make everything worse and I'm going to lose my job and go down hill again.
.
Just hoping for the best, have all your fingers crossed for me ♥️

When I was talking about being molested, it was like man, you know what? I\u2019m going to write about this,\u201d he said.\u2800\n------\u2800\n\u201cIn black and brown communities we do deal with this. I\u2019ve visited prisons where men are like, \u2018I was sexually abused.\u2019 A guy on my own team came to me and said, \u2018It happened to me when I was younger.\u2019 I\u2019m not caring about the stigma. I\u2019m going to speak it with the hope that other people heal from it.\u201d\u2800\n-----\u2800\nHe says he blocked the situation out of his memory, but it resurfaced in 2017. \u201cI kind of wiped that out of my mind for a while. For a long time. I had a tendency to do that, to tuck things away in a corner. My journey back to it came with all the work I\u2019ve been doing on myself, from prayer to meditation to therapy to art. I didn\u2019t even realize it happened until I was doing a film called The Tale, which deals with that subject matter. I actually told my costar, Laura Dern, \u2018Yo, I think this happened to me.\u2019 It just started coming back to me.\u201d\u2800\n------\u2800\nHe said he has always been close with his mom, Dr. Mahalia Hines. He said the conversation, \u201cwasn\u2019t as heavy as I thought it would be. She worked in Chicago public school as a principal and teacher, so the stories she\u2019s heard....Obviously it\u2019s different when it\u2019s your child. But she said, \u2018I hate that these things happened, and I know people that it\u2019s happened to before. Are you okay?\u2019 She checked on me.\u201d\u2800\n------\u2800\n#rape #chi #chicago #ChicagoPD #MentalHealthAwareness #blacknews #NBAFinals #abcnews #black #health #realmen #warriors #black #baldhead #MomentsThatMatter #mom #speakyourself #chilhood #memories #blacklivesmattertrump #BlackLove #beyonce #workhardstayhumble #wisdomquotes #bald #metoo"

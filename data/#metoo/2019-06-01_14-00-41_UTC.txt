Women of the world, beware, this is what you get from @DandgeAjinkya for telling him you're not interested in talking to him anymore. If you're "above 6" he says he'll "make you suck his dick asshole" (sic) and he "keeps people like you".
This is not a #metoo moment, because we should restrict it to workplace harassment. But this guy was deployed by the UN in a war zone in El Salvador when we started talking. It is highly alarming to imagine someone who goes from zero to rapey thoughts in a nanosecond in a war zone. And this is for merely asking why he'd initiated contact with me inspite of me making it clear that I wasn't interested in talking to him. I shudder at what he'd do to someone who's actually rude to him.

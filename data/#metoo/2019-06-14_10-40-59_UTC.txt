WHEN WOMEN REBEL
.
THE UPRISING AGAINST SELF-DEVELOPMENT
.
We're feeling all the things about this creation- fear of being misunderstood, exposed, who do we think we are, how dare we even contemplate sharing this message...?
.
but the time is now...
.
We have 20 years combined experience of the self-development industry- teaching it, participating in it, championing, sharing and advocating systems and techniques to help people 'improve' themselves...
.
and to fix who we were.
.
Over the next 2 weeks we'll share our honest experience of this time and how we came to the realisation that none of it was necessary.
.
We'll lay bare what we thought WAS true, the confronting reality of seeing perhaps it wasn't, and how things have changed since.
.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT BASHING COACHES
.
THIS IS NOT A BITCH FEST
.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT BLAME ON OURSELVES OR OTHERS
.
We thought long and hard about using the word 'against' but it is purely there to stir something within you,
.
at no point will be starting a war on anyone or anything.
.
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY
.
to constant naval gazing
positive thinking
mindset work
visioning
seeking
.
and that is all we want to share.
.
Head to the bio for all the details and to jump on board for an exploration that will deliver a lighthearted challenge into what most of us have always believed to be true ðŸ’œ

Earlier this week, Justice for Lai Dai Han was joined by Nobel Peace Prize recipient, @nadia_murad_taha and other distinguished Parliamentary guests, to unveil the â€˜Mother and Childâ€™ sculpture, designed and made by @rebeccahawkinssculpture 
The sculpture will serve as a beacon of hope to all victims of sexual violence around the world. It depicts a mother and child with different roots trapped by a Strangler Fig tree, a plant native to Vietnam. ðŸ”Ž If you were unable to join us, you can watch the full unveiling on our website - Link in bio!

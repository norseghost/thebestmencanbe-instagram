What I just did here is report digitalized sexual violence to two major global companies — @facebook, which owns @instagram, and @microsoft, which owns @linkedin — and all their affiliates and third-party data miners whose names we don’t know. 
I’m so curious as to what kind of digital profile I have at each company and how my individualized algorithmic profile follows me from site to site, store to store, etc. 
I’m wonder too if an app such as @notme.app, which helps #survivors to report their abusers.

Mine tend to be #exposure, #shaming, and #wine and a high dose of #MeToo and #NiUnaMenos.

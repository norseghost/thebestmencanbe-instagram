CW: sexual assault 
Happy tattoo day to me! Two years ago today I got my first (and so far only) tattoo at @bodyelectrictattoo in Los Angeles. (Swipe for a pic from the day I got it!) It was my way of turning a bad anniversary into a good one. In some ways I hate talking about this, because it brings up traumatic memories and difficult feelings, but at the same time I feel a responsibility to speak out and stand up for other survivors. 
As a sexual assault survivor, there’s a clear before and after in my life, but “after” doesn’t have to mean “worse” forever. Given the right support and tools, we can recover and ultimately thrive. Thanks to the loving support I’ve received from my then boyfriend, now husband @econbarold as well as a talented therapist and a whole community of family, friends, and other survivors, today my life is better in ways I could never have imagined in 2016. I still deal with symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression, but it’s gotten better; I’m off antidepressants, and haven’t had a panic attack in almost 6 months. Change is slow and subtle, and healing certainly isn’t linear, but it is possible. 
@rainn has also been a tremendously useful resource for me. If you or a loved one is a survivor in need of counseling, connection to local resources, or just a listening ear, the folks at the RAINN hotline (or web chat!) are fantastic. Know that you’re not alone: worldwide estimates range from as low as 1 in 6 to as high as 1 in 3 women, and around 1 in 6 men, will experience sexual abuse or assault in their lifetime. Anecdotal evidence suggests these are conservative estimates, as sexual assault and abuse are severely underreported. Survivors are everywhere. If you want to talk, I’m here to believe you, listen to you, and support you.

I can't believe that much time has passed. A lot of traumatic experiences have occurred in my life so much so, they still occur but I'm changing how they will affect me in the now. I recognize I am product of my environment. Nonetheless with dedication , determination, disciplines acquired I will change half of my existence as well as the future of my children.
When we were displaced from #EchoPark something woke up within me and it gave me enough strength to tackle this situation. Since I've returned back to school, spoken up every time I've felt micro aggressions. The fight has been hard but also rewarding. Without our daily challenges we wouldn't be able to Celebrate our triumphs.  Have to remind myself I'm #Good.

Over the years I\u2019ve come to know Reb Shlomo personally, learn from him, sing with him, integrate his  melodies and intentions into my spiritual and very intimate being. \nIn recent years and #metoo, Carlebach\u2019s legacy is tarnished - but not the power of his prayers, intentions and music. Time will tell. With the concern and pain - I remain grateful for the portals he opened for me and for multitudes. \nThis prayer/song comes from the bedtime prayers \u2014 surrounding myself as with a mandala of protection - with angels and with the divine presence overhead - before submitting to sleep. Of all the prayers I\u2019d say at bedtime as a kid - this one still sticks. And this tune often comes back. When my oldest child was in hospital as a baby I\u2019d sing this to her over and over, soothing her, me, the room. \nThis past week a horrible fire demolished the village that Reb Shlomo and his community have built since the 70\u2019s in the hills of Jerusalem. All support to help the families, many are dear friends, can be found here: \nhttps://app.mobilecause.com/vf/CRISIS\n\nShabbat Shalom.  May homes be rebuilt and sleep comes easy to all. - Amichai\n\nAmichai\u2019s Top 50: Soundtrack of my life. 4/20-6-8 2019/Passover-Shavuot 5779"

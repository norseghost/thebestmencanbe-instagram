#WCW Queens Meet our #WomanCrush who was kind enough to share on passion, challenges, motivation and more!

@TheReneeChuks founded the Umami Center (@uccalagos) for culinary arts in 2018 after an exciting career in the hospitality industry in Nigeria, which came promptly after she obtained her Diploma in Culinary Arts from the Prestigious Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts in Austin Texas in 2011.

Her time at Le Cordon Bleu College for Culinary Arts, not only fostered her love for the profession and taught her well, but it also opened the door for her passion which is to make sure that there is an equal playing ground for young Nigerians to thrive in the hospitality industry here, which is presently dominated by foreigners.

She is creating an atmosphere where students can learn creatively the proper ethics, techniques and life hacks to becoming and surviving as a professional chef in the industry. Also, to help all students who pass through the school cook with Love.
She is Academic Director and Chef instructor at Umami Center For Culinary Arts.

Chef Renee is inspired by quite a few people like #AnneSophiePic - a French chef best known for gaining three Michelin stars for her restaurant, Maison Pic, in southeast France. She's also inspired by #GordonRamsey.

This is a special request from two brave young women in Jamaica who reached out to tell me their story of triumph over adversity after watching my movie that deals with these issues. And remember, if anyone wants more information on child abuse and sexual abuse, please reach out to the people at @rainn -- they have the most comprehensive resources around. And the number one thing to remember: don't keep quiet about abuse if you are a victim or a witness to abuse. Shining a light on that darkness is key...

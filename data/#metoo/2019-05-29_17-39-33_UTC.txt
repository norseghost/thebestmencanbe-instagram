This is a post by ‘intergalactic-dorks’, saying: “It’s so strange to spent all your teenage years thinking You’re the ugliest creature in the world. An absolute swamp goblin, if You will. But then You stumble upon old teen photo’s when You’re 20 to realise You were never ugly. You just looker like a child. Your vision of yourself was just being manipulated by hormones, insecurity and unrealistic beauty standards. So yeah if You’re a teenager right now and You think you’re he ugliest motherfucker in the universe You’re wrong. Wait it out for a few more years, this WILL be just a phase in your life and You will overcome it, You can do this.”

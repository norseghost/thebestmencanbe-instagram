Trying to remember to smile. To laugh. To keep my heart open. To keep my confidence strong after having it torn down. It seems terrible tragedy continues to happen to me, but by remembering these things and pushing on with my life and dreams Iâ€™m making myself stronger. It took incredible strength to make it as far into life as I have...and that is one of my most powerful qualities worth cherishing. ðŸ’”

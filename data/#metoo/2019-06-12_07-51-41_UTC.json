You can\u2019t sleep in the car what if the cops show up, stupid bitch\u201d\n\nCovered in vomit I stumble over my steps back into the house \nIt wasn\u2019t long after it happens so fast \nI remember hearing my friend upstairs yelling down how I was slut. \nThey took whatever they wanted \nI don\u2019t remember how I got home but I remember hiding in my bed\nI remember not wanting to go to school because surely everyone knew \nEveryone knew I was a slut and not that their precious Alumni took whatever they wanted\n\nI remember telling their sister I think I was raped and I remember being so confused. She told me I was a liar and that I Wanted it. \nIt must have been my fault\nI continued to hang out there \nIn the room that it happened, with the men that did this to me.\n\nI was in fear, I fear everyone would know how it was my fault, how I was a slut. \nThey took from me.\nDirty\nI can\u2019t stand myself \nThe little jokes they made hinting \nI continued to sleep with him \nHis guilt would show up after 2 30 packs every time like clock work\nHe knew what he did to me \nHe apologized everytime. \nIt took me many years to realize it was not my fault. \nIt was not right and I had been wronged \nI had been raped \nNo matter how I tried to pacify it \nTo normalize it\nTo tell myself i was wrong for continuing to be around them\nI was raped, I do not need to harbor the guilt that is not rightfully mine. I don\u2019t not need to apologize to myself for what they did to me. \nI am strong, I am forgiving\nI am not defined by being raped\nI am defined by my strength, by my ability to live."

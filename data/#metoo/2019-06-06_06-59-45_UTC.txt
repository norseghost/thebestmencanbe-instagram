The Truth is that i can't just boil down to showing fine Pictures, the glam life without what goes on When the camera is not on, to Stick a pose and here Action😭

. 
Your Passion is Gonna bled you out! To see if you would STOP and tend to it's wounds
.
It's Going to stretch you...to See if you would BREAK like a plastic Rubber Ring
.
It's Going To Make you cry, you had better get you hands ready to swipe those tears, Because NO ONE is in better condition to do that for you (ALWAYS)

                        "text": "THE WAR AGAINST ROE\u2800\nRatcheting up the war against women\u2019s rights, Georgia signed bill HB481 banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected. Since our tech\u2019s become so sophisticated, this can happen around 6 weeks. However, what\u2019s being detected then is merely a tiny electrical impulse. This embryo is the size of a sweet pea, with no semblance of a cardiovascular system and no awareness of self. \u2800\nAt 6 weeks, most women don\u2019t even know they\u2019re pregnant.  With such busy lives, it\u2019s easy to slip past your usual time without realizing it. Many women aren\u2019t regular and don\u2019t think twice about going longer without worry. Their cycles might be as much as 45 days apart. This is crazy. And it just gets crazier. \u2800\nThe bill declares that \u201cunborn children are a class of living, distinct person\u201d that deserves \u201cfull legal recognition.\u201d \u2800\nThe drug Misoprostol treats stomach ulcers and is easy to get online. It\u2019s also highly effective in inducing abortions in the first 10 weeks. It\u2019s used routinely by American women. Once this bill takes effect, a woman who uses this drug to self-terminate will have killed a human, committed murder as a matter of law for which the penalty in Georgia is imprisonment or capital punishment.  Anyone who provided the abortion or even aided the woman to obtain one (women need a ride home after the procedure) would be a party to murder. Women who miscarry could be charged with murder if they can\u2019t prove the miscarriage was involuntary and not self-caused. About 10 to 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriages. This is scary stuff. \u2800\nOn a positive note, a number of district attorneys in counties near Atlanta said they won\u2019t prosecute women under this barbaric law. Several productions have vowed to pull their businesses from the state and an Amazon Studio show has been cancelled too. \u201cWe feel we have to stand up for a woman\u2019s right to choose what happens to her body, and so while this is not a decision we have taken lightly, we feel strongly that it\u2019s the right one at this point in time,\u201d Executive producers of \u2018THE POWER\u2019. Let\u2019s hope more companies follow their lead. We must persist. Our bodies, our choice. @blueravenartist\u2800"

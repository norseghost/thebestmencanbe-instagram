                        "text": "When I was 11 years old, I was sexually abused by a family friend. I spent years fighting everyone including myself because I stopped seeing my value. I was broken and honestly it was not the only time I was exposed to abuse.\n\nFor over 20 years, I struggled to see who God created me to be. I carried a nasty secret and a huge dose of shame everywhere I went. Even though, I tried to work through some of the layers... self destruction was a lot easier.\n\nLast year I went back to the place where everything started, where my brokenness began, and I convinced myself it was a healing trip. But, instead it was a triggering trip. So, I did what I do best - obsessed about changing who I am! I became obsessed with fixing myself. I was determined to be someone better but I failed. \nBUT GOD! \ud83d\udc96\n\nI realized the problem was deeply rooted in my self reliance. I didn\u2019t invite God in the depth of my healing process... but He gave me another second chance.\n\nI\u2019m happy to report that as time continues to heal all wounds; I am much different now than I was when this picture was taken in February 2018.\n\nToday, I have a God-confidence I\u2019ve never experienced before. I\u2019ve learn who God created me to be. I\u2019m ready to help women who had experiences similar to mine understand; they are valuable, their experience is not who they are, and they deserve love & respect!\n\nDouble-tap if you have a redemption story of your own\u2026 bonus points if you share with me below!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#shereadstruth #wellwateredwomen #deeplyrooted #jesusovereverything #shedivesdeep #sexualviolence #survivor #jesusiscalling #soulcare #christianwoman #testimony  #jesuslovesyou #jesuslovesme #graceoverhustle  #kingdomoverculture #christianwomenbloggers #sheiscalled #faithoverfear #girlswhowrite #hopedealer #savagefaith #savagewomen #kingdommindset #kingdomwoman #calledtoserve #womeninministry #morethanmypast #jesusismyhealer #redemptionstory #metoo"

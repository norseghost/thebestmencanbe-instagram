Revenge porn hit the headlines this week, when a Spanish bullfighter sparked fierce backlash for his comments on the case of Veronica Rubio. The 32-year-old mother-of-two killed herself days after a sex video was leaked without her consent. 
Spanish media reported she killed herself after her husband saw the video. Her work colleagues shared the video, that was filmed from before she was married by a former partner. 
The famous matador, Fran Rivers sparked outrage by stating ‘Its not manly to make a video like this go viral, but men, as I say this because I am a man, were unable to have such a video and not share it.’

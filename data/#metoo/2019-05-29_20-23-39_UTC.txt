Alright so confession, pizza is my go to cheat food but I also love a good chicken quesadilla. While I have an intolerance to grains, I have found a great grain free option. The brand Siete makes an awesome grain free tortilla. I love to brown it first, make it nice and crispy then add the cheese and chicken. They are so good, and honestly, I canâ€™t really say that there is a huge difference in taste and my skin and gut love me for it. It them a try!! .

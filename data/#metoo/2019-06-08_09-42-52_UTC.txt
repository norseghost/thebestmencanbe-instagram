BALANCE- .
Today the prompt is about balance. Balancing life, balancing work, balancing on one hand. .
But the thing is I’m not ready to move on to a new prompt. I’m not ready to balance my life and make peace with everything because I’m angry. I was blown away by your comments yesterday. You shared your stories, your need for a solution. Although I knew that harassment is something that impacts so MANY women, online and offline, your shares made it that much more real. I’m not naive, I knew it happens. Hell I’ve been harassed by the head of a department and even when I reported it, HR handled it terribly and told me I should have been more assertive in telling him he was out of line. I’m tired of blaming the victims. I’m tired of being told that the only reason people work with me is because I’m attractive and not because I’m really damn good at my job. I’m tired of having to block someone only to find that they’ve been harassing someone else, because blocking is only a temporary solution and doesn’t let them know that their behaviour should change. .
I want to DO something about this! If you know of any resources, or any way of actually contacting @instagram I’d love to hear of it! .

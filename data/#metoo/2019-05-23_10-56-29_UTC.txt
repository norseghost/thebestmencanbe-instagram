When someone takes advantage of you, it changes your personality. It does not make a person more emotional but less. Without women, men are destined to fail... obviously. Balance is key because when women receive respect, they give it. Women should not be worried about getting raped, comments at work, and less pay. We should not be afraid to have goals and be the amazing humans that we are. And we should defiantly not feel afraid to ask for help when we need it. #metoo

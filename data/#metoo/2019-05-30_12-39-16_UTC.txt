What are you and your kiddos love language?!? ❤️⁣
⁣
Words of Affirmation are both mine and Harrison’s top love language. 🥰⁣
⁣
Everyday I make it a point to tell him how loved, smart, handsome, safe, protected, brave, powerful, funny, and magical he is. 💫⁣
⁣
I love squeezing him in a big hug, or grabbing his face and kissing it all over as I speak life over him...I love him so much. 😭⁣
⁣
 And can we talk about how tall he is? ⁣
I’m 5’9 and he’s 5 years old and already breaking 4 feet tall! 😍⁣
⁣
So let’s hear it, what are your top love languages? ⁣

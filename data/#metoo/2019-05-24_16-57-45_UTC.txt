An important reminder from @emilyonlife. We have to show up for ourselves first before we can help others. What does your ideal week look like? Carve out time to read, work out, be alone, be with friends and mark that time as busy. Dedicated time and space is an important part of the 4-day Sunlight Retreat. We need it to learn, grow and heal from trauma☀️

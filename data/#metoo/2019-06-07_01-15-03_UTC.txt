I often get asked if you can still drink 🍸🥃🍷🥂🍻🍹 while doing one of my bootcamps. The short answer; duh 🙄😂 •

Personally, I cut back drastically when I’m committing to a program. I do this for a few reasons; I want to be present when I do a workout (no hangover zone 🚫), since my metabolism has shot through the roof this past year I’m a light weight 🤪, and minimizing the alcohol gets me better results. Oh, & I should also mention that I’d rather have a donut 🍩 than a drink 🥃 🤷‍♀️ I get 2 “treats” a week, & I prefer eating my macros •

With that being said, I should mention that the liquid in my wine glass is in fact a citrus herbal iced tea. I just like pretending I’m sipping something naughty 😉👉 •

Now that you know you get treats every week, you ready to quit watching me and join me already? Better news yet; all month long there’s a $20 discount to join! Drop an emoji below, or fill the application in my bio to get started! 😘

The Monument Quilt recently blanketed the National Mall. "A project of Baltimore based FORCE: Upsetting Rape Culture, is a collection of over 3,000 stories by survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence and our allies, written, painted, and stitched onto red fabric. ⠀
⠀
Our stories literally blanket highly public, outdoor places to create and demand space to heal, and resist a singular narrative about sexual violence."⠀
⠀
If you're being abused or have been abused, please call the Betty Griffin Center 24-hour crisis hotline at (904) 824-1555 or TDD users dial 711.⠀

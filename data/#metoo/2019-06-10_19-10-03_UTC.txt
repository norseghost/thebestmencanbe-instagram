Many of us are afraid to stand out - hesitant to be seen.  We donâ€™t think we deserve to take up space, weâ€™re afraid if we do we will be judged or criticized.  That inner critic tells us we donâ€™t have a reason to be seen; that weâ€™re nothing special. Some have told me they are afraid they are being conceited - usually the people who are concerned about being conceited are the furthered from it!  Take up space!  Be seen!  You have your own unique gifts and voice.  Share with others.  You deserve it just by being you! ðŸ’œ ðŸ“¸: Matthew Smith

Will you be at @denverpopculturecon this year? We will be! We are so excited for the opportunity to do a workshop on how to define your line. Speaking up can sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable and difficult. And if you're anything like us - you probably think of the perfect thing to say just a few minutes too late (ugh!). During the workshop we'll practice how to define our lines, talk about what it means to be an active bystander and together work to create a safe and secure con for everyone. Leave a ðŸ‘Š if you'll be defining your line at this year's Con's.â €

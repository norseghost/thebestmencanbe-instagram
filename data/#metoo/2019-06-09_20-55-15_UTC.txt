This is what itâ€™s all ABOUT PEOPLE! Saw this yesterday just in time for the Tonys and truly could not have gifted myself more of my own brand. I hope everyone around the country will have the opportunity to see this piece of storytelling in some capacity. I so deeply love the theatre because I think at its best, it is such a visceral, singular tool for social change. It shines a light onto people, institutions, and ideas that we may interact with every day, but never see as they really are, or can be. And shining that light was just masterfully executed by @heidischreck and the entire company of @constitutionbwy. I burst out laughing, I silently held sobs, I left changed. Thank you for this brilliant piece of work! #whattheconstitutionmeanstome

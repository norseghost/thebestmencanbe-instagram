*TRIGGER WARNING* “Peace for our time.” Stated by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in 1938 when signing a non-aggression act with Germany.

Yet there is no peace for OURS. There is no peace for the dozens and dozens of firsthand accounts I have heard personally from women for whom rape is all too commonplace. Who were abused in their homes, by people they trusted. Physically. Psychologically. Emotionally. There is no PEACE in a world that will not reprimand those who have done it.

Does anyone lack a story of abuse? If you do, do any of you deny that you know AT LEAST one who has suffered for the abuse? And what do we do for it?

So here’s to them.
Here’s to those that have been taken advantage of. Drugged. Gotten a little too drunk. Cornered. And raped.

Here’s to those who suffered for years in abuse from a spouse, or a “lover,” or a family member.

Here’s to every individual, male and female alike, who have suffered at the hands of true tyranny.

Here’s to the LGBTQ+, who have now surpassed the Jewish community in percentage of hate crimes against them (though the Children of Israel are still not far behind). Here’s to the fact that 80% of rape cases are brought forward by Caucasian women, by that women of color are STILL more commonly assaulted. 
Here’s to a #metoo movement that died down because those in power WANTED it to. 
Leaders of once great nations sit in their seats of power like tyrants in iron thrones. Masses of their followers hide behind the guise of “free speech” for hate crimes. Should one be prosecuted not only for the crime, but for what was going through their minds when they committed it? 
This is not the end of it. This is the beginning. To all of you:

YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

It’s time they realize that.

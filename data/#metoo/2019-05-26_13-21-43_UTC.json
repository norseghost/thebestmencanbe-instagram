                        "text": "When we say a vulnerable person should be less vulnerable, to me that\u2019s like telling someone poor they need a vacation. Undoubtedly that would be great, but it\u2019s ignoring certain realities. Vulnerability is also relative and can involve any number of factors - from a severe learning disability to moving to a city where you don\u2019t know anyone. Either way, vulnerability is a perfectly \u2018allowed\u2019 part of existing and not a reason for anyone to abuse you. All of us have vulnerabilities, from common insecurities to a temporary stress we\u2019re dealing with. You can\u2019t iron them out like a wrinkle in a shirt - it\u2019s just life. Most of us respect that. You wouldn\u2019t make moves on someone who\u2019s recently bereaved. You know they\u2019re raw and in turmoil it\u2019s not fair. You know that you, as the less vulnerable person in the scenario, have a responsibility. This should be our norm. That a person\u2019s vulnerabilities bring out the best in us, not the worst. That as someone vulnerable, we deserve more respect, not less. When someone intentionally breaks this trust, this is the wrong, *not* the fact someone happened to be vulnerable in the first place. Imagine a mother with a stroller. She gets to some steps and is struggling. Some people walk by. Another might stop to help. But in what world would it be the mother\u2019s fault if a passer-by sees it as an opportunity and steals her purse? That\u2019s how society behaves regarding abuse. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be so <insert normal human quality>.\u201d \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d This is saying it\u2019s ok and normal for predators to own the field and we must hide and constrain ourselves or get picked off accordingly. It\u2019s totally backwards. Predators aren\u2019t even *that* many people. And, like a lot of bullies, they\u2019re often cowards, which is why they go for vulnerabilities in the first place. We\u2019ve got this, more than got this. If - instead of fearing and turning on vulnerability - we stand by our right to be vulnerable and stick together."

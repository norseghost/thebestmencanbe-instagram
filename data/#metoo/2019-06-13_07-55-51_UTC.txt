Do you get what I’m saying babes? I always just assumed that when a relationship ended everything would be split down the middle and be FAIR 🤷🏻‍♀️ I’m a little shocked that it’s just not the case. I have friends who are supporting their families without any contribution from their ex (usually both financially and emotionally) and can’t afford to get legal advice or get no help from government in pursuing what they should be receiving from the dad. I feel that as a woman it makes us feel particularly vulnerable and unheard, unseen and under recognized for what we have to do. I’m just a little stunned that it’s still happening, that a woman’s worth as a mother, provider and carer is still not valued. I’ve had to deal with my own situation and anger around it (and honestly I’ll be ok - I have a roof over my head at least) but I know so many women trying to keep it together and support their family who aren’t as lucky as me. What do you think? Has this been your experience too? Something needs to change 🤔🙃🙌🏽 #metoo #divorce #relationships #parenting #feminism #support #mama #menopausemademedoit #thegoddesschronicles #middleagedgoddess

The National Center for PTSD explains that the most effective treatments for post traumatic stress disorder involve medication or different types of therapy. While research has proven that various medications drastically improve symptoms, there are many non-medical alternative approaches that are just as beneficial. Five such non-medical alternative treatments for PTSD include cognitive behavioral therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, sound therapy, mind-body medicine and practicing mindfulness.

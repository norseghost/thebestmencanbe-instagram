What does a strength look like to you? 
If I asked @lachelledavenport this  question, she would flex and say...ME! :) Empowering women starts with the men in this world. It all begins right in our families, workplaces, and neighborhoods. Write a note of thanks to that teacher who encouraged you years ago, pick up coffee for that new mom in your office who’s struggling to balance it all, or tell your own sister, daughter, girlfriend, mother or grandmother how much you appreciate them. Men can’t do it alone, why do you think women can? Stand up for the people who brought you into this world. I’m all in for equality, how about you?

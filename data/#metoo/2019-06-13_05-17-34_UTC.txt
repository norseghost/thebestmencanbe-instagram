High heel low: Male minister prescribes for women, again !!
“Necessary and appropriate” is how Japan’s male labour minister responded to the popular campaign #KuToo, which asked the government to intervene in the workplace code that insists on women wearing high heels. In the aftermath of #MeToo Yumi Ishikawa started a hashtag petition, combining the words kutsu (shoe) and kutsuu (pain), to draw attention to the way Japanese women are compelled to wear heels to work. Perhaps the minister could try walking a mile in the shoes he considers so necessary before upholding their virtues.

The high heel debate, like the hijab debate, is seemingly endless. Some protest the binding, constricting nature of it, how women have to disfigure their spines and sacrifice locomotive freedom to be feminine, risk ingrown toenails and tendonitis. Others see it as an expression of confidence and authority, the capacity to loom large, to announce one’s presence with the clippety clop of high heels.

But it is a reminder that patriarchy is infinitely devious, it shifts shape across cultures but is always about disciplining female behaviour. Japan’s company dress code can sound oppressive to us in India, but high heels are the norm for professional women in many corporate cultures. In India, we have our own ways of policing women’s attire. The #KuToo movement is a yearning for freedom, entirely in step with the times. Young people around the world are making athleisure, sneakers and Birkenstocks, cool again. Sooner rather than later, women will walk all over other people’s notions of appropriate attire.

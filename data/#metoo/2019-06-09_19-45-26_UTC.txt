Be willing to be uncomfortable. Be comfortable being uncomfortable. It may get tough, but it's a small price to pay for living a dream 
Peter McWilliams

I've been getting uncomfortable in so many ways over here, but it's so good. It means I'm growing. It means that change is coming, and change is so necessary. And I want to be an ever evolving being on this earth, for as long as I live.

I've got big dreams, and I'm really honing in on them lately. Grateful for the space to dream, and breathe, and speak life into those aspirations.

You can achieve anything you set your heart on, friends.
Believe it.
Plan it.
FIGHT for it.

Live life.
Be BRAVE.

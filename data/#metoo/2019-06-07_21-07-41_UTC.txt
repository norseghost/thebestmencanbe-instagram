Because I did not know any other way.
.
Because I could not see a way out.
.
Because every time I tried to leave he said "I am sorry, I love you and things will change"
.
Because I had no money of my own.
.
Because I hoped and prayed that I would have my happy ever after.
.
Because it was better to be married then “single” & “divorced”
“What will people say?”
.
Because I did not know what domestic violence even was.
.
Because it was not happening to me.
.
Had I known what I know now I would have walked away the first moment I experienced abuse. .
It's so important to know what a healthy and unhealthy relationship is. .
To know how to identify the red flags and to know what to do.

According to research:
One woman in four experiences domestic violence in her lifetime
Office for National Statistics (2016) Focus on Violent Crime and Sexual Offences, 2014/15

Two women are killed each week by a current or former partner in England and Wales
Office for National Statistics (2016) Compendium – Homicide (average taken over 10 years) 
In the year ending March 2016, 1.2 million women reported experiences of domestic abuse in England and Wales
Office for National Statistics (2016) Domestic Abuse in England and Wales: year ending March 2016

Whilst this number is shocking, we also know it is grossly underestimated.

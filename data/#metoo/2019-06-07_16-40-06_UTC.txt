Share & Discuss: How do you think the #MeToo Movement has impacted survivors?
.
"The #MeToo Movement has given survivors a platform to tell their stories, and we are so grateful RISE can be there to help them," said RISE Executive Director Jennifer Adams.
.
"We've definitely seen an increase in the need for our services. Calls to the RISE hotline increased 50%."
.
That's why we're asking for your help to raise $20,000 by June 30 to support local survivors. Please consider donating today at RISEslo.org (link in bio).

My uncensored TEDx Talk is FINALLY LIVE! What a journey it’s been! 🙏❤️ 💪— See the entire 14 minute #tedtalk at kierstenparsons.com/ted-Talk or #linkinbio👆 And read more about my Tedx experience (on the same link) and why I decided to edit the video @tbd.hathcock filmed of me on the day of the event instead of waiting for TED to finally OK it or ban it after 7 months. I’m done playing the game.  #abusesurvivor #woundedattachment #becomethecarpenterofyourlife #narcissisticabusesurvivor #childhoodsexualabusesurvivor #tedtalk #modmomfurniture #trustyourintuition #healing #family #vulnerability #standup #metoo #enough #stopthecycle #sharktank #coldcases #detectives #spiritualawakening #narcissist

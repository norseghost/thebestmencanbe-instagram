At a moment when the phrase “witch hunt” is repeatedly misused, “Blue Boar VR” invites viewers to play in the complex absurdity of accusations that were used against artist Victoria Bradbury’s tenth great-grandmother in the infamous Salem Witch Trials. Lines are drawn in the piece between contemporary uses of the phrase "witch hunt,” the #metoo movement, and women's power. The scene uses an embroidered digital motif employing voxels and textures to conjure imagery related to 17th century hand-sewn designs. Blue Boar VR allows us to replay the past, where we can begin to imagine possible futures. The work will be on display as part of the curated exhibition at the IEEE GEM Conference at Yale CCAM next week!

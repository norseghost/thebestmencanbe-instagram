After countless hours of "backcombing" the yard, I stripped the grass down to its bare bones. I figure that when I put anything on the lawn for a few days it gets flourecent green and dies. So I thought I'd try doing that with the entire yard before I lay the white clover seed as a new ground cover!! This task has been especially good for me to release alot of pent up emotional energy. I imagine its a similar satisfaction to me as punching is to many.

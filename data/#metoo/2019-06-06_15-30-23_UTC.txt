Post #2 - clarification: 
1. The painting is artwork by the amazing muralist #ramimeiri_graffiti_tel_aviv 
2. I am against vandalism.  3. The painting is a reference to the iconic Israeli film metzitzim (“Peekers”) which was filmed on that beach in 1972. This is a perfect example of change, where cultural reference clashes with social change. Painting was ironic. Generation #metoo is not.  4. What’s more important? An artistic gesture to a celebrated film or the message it might send to boys and girls who don’t know the reference? 
5. The context of the art: A PUBLIC BATHROOM, WITH SHOWERS. Should it not be part of our judgment of art? Isn’t context part of the message (that might change within time)? Comment.

Work...well this is what it looks like for survivor visionaries creating in collaboration with the "Soul" intention of positively supporting sexually exploited & abused humans through grassroots leadership and business development. @socialgardenteam has created a space for healing, support, events, commUNITY and inclusion. We talked about how everyone has gifts to offer & shifting from assessing for weaknesses to a strength based approach to services. Grateful for this day & the incredibly talented women I am surrounded with. Keep Shyning ‚≠êÔ∏è üôè ‚≠êÔ∏è .

Stop and think about this statistic.... this is nearly HALF of women who attend college.

Too often, we associate domestic violence with people who are older, married even. We fail to realize that it is teens, students, and young women who experience abuse at the highest rates.

As a college student and victim, I couldn’t focus anymore on what mattered. Managing my abuser and his behavior became my top priority every day... balanced by his manipulation and control. I started to skip classes, my grades failed, I became anxious, was severely under-weight, until eventually, I was forced to drop out of school and become homeless.

We need to talk about this issue as early and often as possible. Everyone feels alone, but they’re not... Not only is abuse an extreme violation of human rights, but there are severe secondary consequences - things like anxiety, depression, lost focus, detachment, low self-care, academic and career struggles, and mental and emotional health issues.

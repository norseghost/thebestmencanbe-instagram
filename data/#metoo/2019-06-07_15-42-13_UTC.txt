This is upsetting news. Terrifying news. But it's nothing new for most women. For most women fear is a part of every day life. 
Hey guys. We have all averted your gaze at some point, have tried to look away instead of saying no, or fuck off, pretended we didn't hear you on the bus or the train. And while ignoring you we hoped it wasn't going to anger you, and your anger wasn't going to put us in danger. 
Have you ever said "sorry but I have a boyfriend", "sorry I am married", in the hope it'll get rid of unwanted attention? If you have don't be ashamed, it's because you know a cave man will respect another cave man's property. But won't respect a woman saying no. 
Visible lesbians don't have that option. Don't have that choice. Homophobia meets mysoginy day after day when you're a lesbian. 
And when there is an ideological war on women, when we are taking steps back and teaching our society that women don't own their bodies, that's the result. In 2019 we are being told again that we are here for someone else's pleasure, that we are here for someone else's gaze, and that we don't get to make decisions for ourselves. And when we do, we pay. When we say no, we get punished. 
I have been feeling powerless and angry and desperate since Alabama passed the most restrictive abortion legislation in the United States. I hope those governors burn in the same hell they so strongly believe in. Because their legacy is a living hell for all women.

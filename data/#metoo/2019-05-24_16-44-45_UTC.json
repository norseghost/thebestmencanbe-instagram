But we sure as heck aren\u2019t in an ideal \u2018women find it a bloody breeze to put their needs in the mix\u2019 kinda world! \u2063\n\u2063\nPlus \u2018me too\u2019 reminds me of how much we as women still endure and how much of what we have endured is still coming to light while many women are still enduring the delights of misogyny combined with as many isms as you could throw a stick at. \u2063\n\u2063\nNo, I think \u2018me too\u2019 is just not going to cut it for me...or my daughters...or probably my daughters daughters. ME FIRST feels like such an important statement for women because we\u2019ve often been \u2018me last\u2019 for so long that we need to boldly, assertively, and givingnotafuckly move to the me first position and experience getting our needs met first before we can swing to a more middling position like me too. \u2063\n\u2063\nAs our EmBODYment challenge is coming to an end this month in the LemonAid community we\u2019re looking ahead to June when we\u2019ll be considering our self care and putting ourselves FIRST goddam it!! \u2063\n\u2063\nIf you would like to join our month of ME FIRST challenges, looking at why we might find it difficult to put ourselves first, dealing with difficult people, addressing guilt, our personal payoffs in putting others first (shock horror!), the consequences of not putting ourselves first and many a fine and useful discussion in the online community with other LemonAiders you can! Sign up link in our bio. \u2063\n\u2063\nWe run a different challenge almost every month and they throw up useful discussions and change aplenty! Check out our website for what\u2019s coming up this year and beyond... \u2063\n\u2063\n#mefirst \u2063#metoo #selfcare #womenempowerment #womenempoweringwomen #communityofwomen #dontbeadoormat #martyrdom #healthyboundaries #justsayno #itsoktosayno #timeforyou #timeforyourself #healthybodyandmind #childfree #coparenting #putyourselffirst #loveyourself #goodrolemodel"

Mama Mai and I read every comment from you Mai Fam on all of our episodes. And one question that comes up often is about why Mama Mai and I had a falling out for 8 years, which I mentioned in an earlier episode. I realized it was because, I still to this day never knew how to approach this burning question we avoided between us. And now, I'm at a place in my life where I can't let fear or doubt stand in the way of the strength I deserve to have. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So here we go. It's the first time Mama Mai and I ever address this.. and to be honest we both wanted to cameras off halfway through. But something happened where we realized we both needed to overcome our fear and let our love as mother and daughter supercede anything to ever separate us again. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Thank you Mai Fam for being beside us in this life changing moment we shared. We pray in watching this that you, too, find healing within yourself and close the gap between your loved ones.

It’s amazing how communication works! The squirrel was being a squirrel; rummaging around for tasty tidbits. But when he started clawing at the cushion, I simply asked what he was doing. Galoot (my faithful coffee companion kitty) got in on the chastisement - he said more I believe - and the squirrel stopped immediately. We enjoy a moment of quiet reflection between us all and then the squirrel went on his merry way and my cushions are still in tact. That my friend is basic communication skills in play. If you see someone doing something that you don’t like, it’s ok to question them! You never know; a mutual understanding and appreciation can grow from that. #ladyboss #beyourself #metoo #standupforyourbeliefs #bekind #coffee #petsmakelifebetter #listentolife #appreciatenature #liveyourlife #galoot

WOMEN ARE WOMEN'S BIGGEST ENEMY!
How much truth you think is there in this statement?

I used to believe that it's a conventional wisdom. But after learning from my own experiences I can say that there's some truth in it.
According to me, it's like 60-40.
Yes, women are their worst enemy and a greatest cheerleader too.

We all know that women are sensitive & highly complex human being. They can eat, read, watch movies and at the same time can plan for their next day. Thats how they function😁.
There mind never sleeps👻🤓.
.
We are our own enemy because we're too obsessed & jealous of our own people. We badmouth, gossip, we compare, we compete, we demean our own people verbally more than men.

Being a women itself, we question other women's character and upbringing
Why? 
Because we can't see them flourish professionally or personally, living better lifestyle.

We constantly compare & crictisize another women on clothes, makeup & what not.
We call them slut, bitches without giving a thought.
Reason we're very much insecure about our ownself.
--------
Now comes another 40% women, who're Alphawomen.
One who's not cocky but confident
One who supports another women.
One who rise by lifting others.
One who's independent & unapologetically loyal to her Tribe.
She knows how to love & respect.
She intimidates insecurity and mediocrity.

Being a alpha women, my only message to conventional women is you can never rise by putting other women down. You can never lead a happy life with your insecure & jealous behaviour.

After #metoo movement even men had learn to a great extent on how to treat women with respect. But when will you learn the same.

Break your dimensions!
Grow up!
We have to come together if we want to make a difference in society.
Stop being each other’s worst enemies.
Love, respect & assist one other.
Be like a ALPHAWOMEN💪
Strong & Loyal💪

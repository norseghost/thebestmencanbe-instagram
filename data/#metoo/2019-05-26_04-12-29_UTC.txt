Post 2: and how he's a lady killer. He continued to make sexual comments and then I tried to leave. I told him I wanted to go grocery shopping, but he didn't get the hint. He insisted on coming with me. So I changed my mind and just decided to leave. He followed me to my car and tried to kiss me. I turned my head and told him no and that I didn't want to kiss him...he got angry...told me that he expected to at least get to second base with me and then he locked me into a bear hug, grabbed my head with his hand and tried to physically force me to kiss him. I kept trying to pull away and he wouldn't let me go until I screamed at him. Then he backed up and said, "Well at least you have the flowers to remember when I was nice to you." I drove off terrified, blocked him and hoped I'd never see him again. Then tonight, 8 years later, he resurfaced with a different name (now he's going by Jaime age 32), a different story (he's telling people he's in law school), and a slightly different look (his profile pictures all had a mustache and sunglasses). So ladies, if you could share this and spread his picture, my hope is that we can prevent him from actually doing real harm to a woman. Steer clear of this weirdo.

Refer to first post on my profile for the remainder of the story.

"It can be very triggering for survivors when sexual assault is being discussed in the mainstream media so much, so itâ€™s important to check in with oneself and be aware of your reactions. Turning off the news, choosing not to read an article, and dismissing yourself from discussions are sometimes necessary forms of self-care." -- Carly Haeck, @carlyhaecktherapy

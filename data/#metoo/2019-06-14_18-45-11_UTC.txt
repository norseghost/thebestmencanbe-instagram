Affirmations are a big part of my life, and of course, my business. I've incorporated affirmation jars to be available at my book signings as a way to encourage you to integrate them into your life. My affirmation jars have been a hit and people have been requesting them so they will be available on my website over the next few days ‚ú® You can pick up yours in person tomorrow at @RiverOaksBookstore from 3-5pm üìö I hope you can join me ‚ú® You can RSVP on the #linkinbio ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚Ä¢

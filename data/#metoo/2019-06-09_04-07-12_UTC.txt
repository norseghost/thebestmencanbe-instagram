I think one of the gifts from women sharing their stories is that it can encourage all of us to trust the legitimacy of our experiencesâ€”and to honor the diversity of those. Women have been crucial at every step of my healing process, and I am so grateful to those who are able and willing to vocalize their rage and grief, their hope and courage, their trauma and healing. 
Sharing my own story is nothing more, and nothing less, than an attempt to pay it forward.

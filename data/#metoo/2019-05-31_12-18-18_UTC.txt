Good morning good people & happy Friday to ya!!! We had such a lovely evening yesterday here in Chi town that I decided to take my bike out for a spin. I rode down the lake shore to Hyde Park and wouldn’t you know it, I was feeling a little “snakey” fortunately I came across this fabulous restaurant which claims to have the “healthiest FAT food in the world”.... not sure about that but I will say it was YUMMY!! I had a jerk, Mango Salmon bowl and I enjoyed every delicious bite. The art work inside inspired me. Seems that everywhere I go lately I have reminders to keep pushing, keep seeking life, love, happiness & for that, I am truly thankful. I hope you all have a wonderful, inspiring weekend. Much love to you.

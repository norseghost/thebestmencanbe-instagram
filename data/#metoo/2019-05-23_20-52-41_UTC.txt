Hugs. ðŸŒ± The last few weeks have had me real Cat Got Your Tongue kind of words-arenâ€™t-my-first-language quiet. Hung in the balance of things releasing, new coming through, molting, forgiving, calling in, anchoring roots into new compassion amidst old maelstroms ....all inbetwixt the chaos of the plate tectonics shifting in personal-is-political wombrooms everywhere.  When in doubt, hands in soil.  When in doubt, sleep.  When in doubt, cry.  So this is just to say, hi, Iâ€™m right here, alongside you, Learning, Loving, Grieving, growing, not-knowing. Thanks for all your heart-sung stories shining as waymarkers. #youknowme #holyinstant #provoice #dontknow #eachoneteachone #plantfriends #griefandpraise #wecandowhateverwewant #thesunismybabydaddy #lovetheseedthatsplanted #hi #metoo

Ending The Support Of Human Trafficking At Pride & Beyond. 
Sex positive events are a freedom we in Canada have, and enjoy. 
Unfortunately these events are often promoted using people in the sex industry. 
As a Pride Committees, it is your responsibility to put forth a healthy and mindful campaign which does not promote human trafficking. 
The concept of sexual liberation should not be confused with turning a blind eye to humans, whom are being pimped out for sex attendance to Pride events. 
The circumstances which surround many in the adult industry have led them into a trap, despite the outward appearance and propaganda. Do some people wish this for themselves as a life? -If so pay your taxes and legitimize oneself. 
It being our 50th anniversary of resistance and fighting for human rights- we as a Community continue to normalize this form of advertising to our young people. 
Many in our Community find themselves vulnerable to influences which are glamorized. Sex trade is not celebrity. 
I ask that Pride be human tragedy free, and that all references of Pride be removed and boycotted from events using human trafficking. 
I can only speak on behalf of what I have seen in Toronto Ontario Canada. 
Canada has strict human trafficking laws to which authorities and Human Rights advocates are preparing to protest:
Pitbull Events, Toronto, ON. 
The Black Eagle, Toronto ON. 
CLUB 120, Toronto ON. 
The concept of freedom of expression is not under attack, human trafficking is. 
We must remember that human trafficking  is the act of the privileged taking advantage of the unfortunate. 
It is time Pride makes a stand against human trafficking. 
Thank you for your time.

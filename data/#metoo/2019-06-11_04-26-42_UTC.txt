The feeling of being overwhelmed doesn’t begin to describe how I’m feeling right now. Someday I’ll be able to articulte things into sentences that become paragraphs that become a book. Until that time, thank you to those of you who are loving on the kids and I as we try and figure things out. All I can say is that speaking against abuse can cost everything, but covering it up could cost you your soul.

"Rather a beautiful view of this current sculpture commission which no-one will ever see" - Artist @rebeccahawkinssculpture talks about the "Mother and Child" sculpture currently in progress. ‘Mother and Child’ is a memorial to all victims of sexual violence around the world. It is based on the concept of the Strangler Fig tree, a parasitic plant which takes over a host tree by entwining itself around its roots, trunk and branches, and is common in Vietnam. The mother represents one of the Vietnam War’s many victims of sexual assault at the hands of the South Korean soldiers. The child represents one of the Lai Dai Han, born as a result of these acts.

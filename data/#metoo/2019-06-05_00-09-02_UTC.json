                        "text": "So, @mileycyrus was grabbed by a man the other night. To me, it\u2019s not shocking to see because it happened to me. Yep, when I was 13 years old. I was grabbed and then taken advantage of right in front of some of my most trusted adults. I have never told my family this because of what people say to little girls, teenagers and women. Because I was told back then it was not okay to cause such problems. It wasn\u2019t my fault. This isn\u2019t my fault. And! This isn\u2019t her fault. I can assure you that my attire was not the reason I was taken advantage of. It was what was underneath all of my clothes. Sickening, right? I\u2019m sick. Like, sick of this, shit. This is getting beyond our reach. How can we help ourselves and daughters?  AND, THEN!  Then I read the comments directed to @mileycyrus and want to cry. I am brought right back to that moment and freeze with terror. These are women making these comments, y\u2019all! Women are saying it\u2019s ok to be grabbed by a COMPLETE stranger bc she was dressed in crop top and jeans. BITCH, if I could, I WOULD, wear a damn crop top and jeans. So, get the F out of here with this nonsense and HORRIFYING rhetoric. Who told this women that that IS okay? That\u2019s what scares me. Honey, NO. NO, it is not. Not now, not ever. Protect your daughters. It happened to me. Frozen and staring  at my most trusted male hoping he could see the terror in my eyes. But he didn\u2019t. He missed it. So, it\u2019s up to me. Us. You all! To protect our girls and daughters because this IS NOT OKAY. Done. #metoo -\n_\n_\n\n#metoomovement #stillnotaskingforit #momsofinsta #instagram #instamom #mom #momlife #woman #women #unite #daughters #mentalhealthawareness #parenting #parenthood #mayhem #motherhood #mayhemtomotherhoodblog #rainbowbaby #infantloss #grief #ptsd screenshot and comments via @mileycyrus"

"1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men will be raped at some point in their lives."
Personally believe the number of men is significantly higher but because of shame they never come forward.
We CAN fix this. We can start by teaching our children to value their bodies and the bodies of others, to tell boys that they can say no and if the other person continues then they NEED to report what happens. By teaching our kids that "no means no" and how to get away and protect themselves. By believing our kids when they say that someone touched them, not negate it because "they're family or friends, or isn't like that". We can by start believing survivors. By lobbying for better and faster rape kit processing. By getting survivors proper help. By punishing the perpetrators and getting them help.

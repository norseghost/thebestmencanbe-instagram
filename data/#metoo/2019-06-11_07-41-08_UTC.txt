Good Morning My Fierce Fabulous Family  its Transformation Tuesday here's Today's quote  Eleanor Roosevelt coined many motivational quotations and this is one of those that build your self-esteem. Many people suffer from inferiority complex because a few silly bullies called them fat or ugly. However, superiority or inferiority is the product of your own psychological make-up. Nobody can govern your feelings unless you yourself give that power to them. Remember you are unique, no one can be you. Just find your true calling, realise your worth and be yourself. Take pride in yourself and your actions. Your confidence will keep your haters at bay. Never allow anyone to walk over you as you are no doormat.

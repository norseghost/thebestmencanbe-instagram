Do some people wish this for themselves as a life? -If so pay your taxes and legitimize oneself. \nIt being our 50th anniversary of resistance and fighting for human rights- we as a Community continue to normalize this form of advertising to our young people. \nMany in our Community find themselves vulnerable to influences which are glamorized. Sex trade is not celebrity. \nI ask that Pride be human tragedy free, and that all references of Pride be removed and boycotted from events using human trafficking. \nI can only speak on behalf of what I have seen in Toronto Ontario Canada. \nCanada has strict human trafficking laws to which authorities and Human Rights advocates are preparing to protest:\nPitbull Events, Toronto, ON. \nThe Black Eagle, Toronto ON. \nCLUB 120, Toronto ON. \nThe concept of freedom of expression is not under attack, human trafficking is. \nWe must remember that human trafficking  is the act of the privileged taking advantage of the unfortunate. \nIt is time Pride makes a stand against human trafficking. \nThank you for your time. \nStephen Perin Secular Director \nSecular Officiant Activist\nThe White Pine Rectory &\nThe Order Of Secular Assembly,\nPrincipal Officer \nThe Secular Party Of Canada (Party Name To Change-Elections ON). c SPC 2019. \n#IWasCutToo, #WomensMarchCanada, #MeToo, #SecularPartyOfCanada, #StephenPerinSecularDirector, #PolyPolyPolyamorous, #Pride, #BlackLivesMatter, #AntifaCanada, #IdleNoMore, #EndZoosInCanada, #BlackSheepOfficiant."

Presenting to the docents this week. 
#legaSHE

The #MeToo and #TimesUp movements were driven by a group of women who were done being silent about sexual harassment and sexual violence. These women used their voice and platforms to unify survivors and empower women everywhere to speak up and speak out. Our exhibition brings together a diverse group of local artists who are using their art to voice their support of this campaign, to drive conversations about this formerly taboo topic and to show women in our community that #TimesUp and we no longer need to be silent. From depictions of stories of victimized women in ancient biblical times to art about womenâ€™s roles in World War II to images of contemporary protesters and survivors on the local and national stage, we want our community to know that there is a legacy of sisterhood that is full of breath and depth and no one needs to feel alone in this community.

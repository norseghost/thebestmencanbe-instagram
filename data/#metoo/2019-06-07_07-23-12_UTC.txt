We’ve loved our last day at Women Deliver! Started off early with an interactive session hosted by Dove on how we can collectively take action on body confidence. We had the chance to listen to an outstanding panel on the theme “The Power of Movements and hear first hand what happens when many demand change. Barkha Dutt opened the session by a moving testimony of her own experience, calling on participants to use their voice, and share their story even privately. We feel privileged to have heard Tarana Burke, Founder of the #MeToo movement speak about the power of movements, as well as Zoleka Mandela, grand-daughter of Nelson Mandela and Ambassador for the Child Health Initiative, Tina Tchen, MIchelle Obama’s former Cabinet Director and Ailbhe Smyth, activist and a key actor in changing the abortion law in Ireland.

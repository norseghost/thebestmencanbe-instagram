Tja, there U can see @jessicachastain what happens when U are hiding way to long & nobody does your job sufficiently, nobody watched over @natalieportman & see what she did: she demolished Aquamarine 👨🏿 alias @prideofgypsies I mean as the true Aquaman he is allowed to have three wifes, but he only got 1! so far: the mother of @zoeisabellakravitz . Thats why he could have easily taken @natalieportman as his second wife, but @natalieportman said: No! Which was perfectly OK - but due to her rather outdated feministic attitudes & convictions (“...he wants a second wife=like a little Harem in old Persia=I must & will terminate that son of a bitch now!”) she launched a media campaign against the poor sod comparable to the #metoo debate - & now @prideofgypsies has probs with his Rocha at home: cause the mother of @zoeisabellakravitz doesnt like so much media attention: she prefers to keep important stuff in private space - like U once upon a time, just like U @jessicachastain 😘🤷‍♂️🙄

"THE JOURNEY"
THE JOURNEY IS JUST BEGINNING & I AM ENJOYING EVERYTHING I DO...
THE JOURNEY IS A LIFETIME PASSION SO I WILL PRESS FORWARD TO SEE IT THROUGH.
THIS JOURNEY IS NOT GIVEN TO THE SWIFT BUT I MUST ADMIT YOU SHOULD STAY STRONG...
THE POWER TO LOVE, THE POWER TO HEAL ARE JUST SOME IF THE GIFTS YOU WILL OBTAIN & THE COURAGE TO KNOW YOU BELONG.
SO I EMBRACE THIS JOURNEY WITH APPRECIATION & EVERY CHALLENGE I ACCEPT WITH PRIDE...
THIS JOURNEY IS NO MORE THAN MY CALLING THAT'S FILLED WITH COMPASSION & JOY I DARE NOT HIDE ‚ù§

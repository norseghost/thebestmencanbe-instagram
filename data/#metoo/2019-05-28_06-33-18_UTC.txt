We live in a female privileged world where men suffer from issues of disadvantage that are far more serious than looks and sex. There are huge gender gaps in every aspect of life e.g. education where men are outnumbered by women across the globe. We live in a world that teaches boys and men to provide for and enable women thereby empowering them at their expense. A world that preaches to men and women to rush to women's aide when they are in trouble whilst being critical of men when they fall on hard times. This all contributes to empowering women and putting men at a disadvantage. We live in a world that outright refuses to hold women accountable for their actions were conviction rates for women are greatly lower than those for men for all crimes without exception. Where prison sentences for women are lower than those for men. Were sexual abuse by women against men is considered hot. A world were men die in the hundreds of thousands in wars without a care. A female privileged world were organisations are very careful to site the number of women killed in attacks and conflicts. A world were fathers are denied their rights to their children whilst mothers are automatically awarded that right by virtue of nothing but their gender. A world that preaches that mothers are superior parents. A world that pumps all its resources into women whilst neglecting men. A world where the homeless population is largely made up of men but the vast majority of shelters are for women who make up a non-existent minority of that population. 
I can go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on ......its good that these issues are being debated more and more now. We need to talk about these issues and we need to address them. We need change.

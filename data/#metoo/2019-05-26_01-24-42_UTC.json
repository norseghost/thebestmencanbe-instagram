You don\u2019t have to scroll back far to gather enough information to piece my story together but why am I here, in this space sharing so much? Because I know how valuable a relatable soul can be. I spent years feeling trapped inside my own head, broken and ashamed of my past. Today I realize how each moment prepared me for this. I have endured much, overcome much and by the grace of God I am unashamed enough to share it. I don\u2019t need a pat on the back or a \u201cyou\u2019re so brave\u201d message ... I share because I feel called, most of the time it\u2019s easy, sometimes it\u2019s not but I can\u2019t ignore the urge to make use of this life of mine.\n.\nSo ... if you\u2019re here for a well curated feed, I\u2019m not your girl. I\u2019m raw and real, sometimes hard to digest but always authentic. I talk about drug abuse, sexual abuse, teen pregnancy, adoption, marriage, sex, parenting, mental health and our nomadic life and not necessarily in that order. Sometimes I post every day and sometimes the words don\u2019t flow and instead of forcing it, I take a break. I love the community I\u2019ve met through these squares but my mental health and my family comes first. I\u2019m an open book and always happy to chat through DM\u2019s if you\u2019re not comfortable asking questions on my feed!\n.\nSo tell me, what brought you here and why have you stayed?"

I haven’t posted in what seems like forever but there are no rules nor timestamps on healing. There isn’t a formula that you can use to magically heal from the experience. For now, I’m just going to worry about me, my family, and my healing journey. Thank you for those who continue to reach out and check in on me ~ you have been the light in this otherwise dark story.  Assaults no doubt occur somewhat frequently in the tattoo world but I'll be the first to say that 99.9999% of artists are beautiful, creative, and full of integrity. .

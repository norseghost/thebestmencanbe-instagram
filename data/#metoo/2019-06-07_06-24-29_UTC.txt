Today was therapy session 5.
The hardest session I've ever had.
10 months into this journey and I really am feeling like I've just begun.
Memories appearing. Anger. Grief. 
I cried all the way there today because I thought I wouldn't cry there if I let it out beforehand.
But I still did.
The things I told him today, I have never ever told anyone. 
It was exhausting, like purging my soul. 
It was so hard.
But I'm looking for gratefulness in every single day, even in every difficult step.
And I'm so grateful that I'm in a place that I got to voice the things I've never said.
That it's all coming back now because my mind is healing.
This is my chance to let it out. Learn to let go of what I've hung onto.
But best of all, this is my chance to GROW ❤
I am coming back to LIFE.🙌
And with time, I will FLOURISH 🌻
I AM A WARRIOR UNSTOPPABLE💪

Hang in there. There will be days that floor you. But you WILL get up. And you will be better than before.
I believe that 🙏

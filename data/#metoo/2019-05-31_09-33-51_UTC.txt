Huge respect to Ellen for speaking out and sharing her experiences of childhood sexual abuse.

The more we speak out the more barriers break  down and the more we open up about the shame, guilt and reprocussions that we experienced. 
In speaking out we show others that they are not alone and that other's have walked alongside them.
I wrote my book for this very reason. To share with others that we can be OK. We are not broken. We can be vulnerable and strong in equal measure and that we are not the sum total of our past. We are so much more.

It is essential that victims are believed no matter when they disclose. Many people choose for whatever reason to hold their abuse in, to deny it to themselves or forgot it completely due to trauma. The brain has a magnificient way of protecting us.

Whatever the circumstances surrounding the abuse and disclosure I stand with Ellen and those other survivor's and choose to shout my truth loudly.

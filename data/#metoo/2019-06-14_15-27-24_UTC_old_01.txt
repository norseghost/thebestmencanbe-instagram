What my mornings now look like, my breakfast lap office. Complete with a furry weight blanket and note review and taking. It been an intensive few months...and a lifetime. It’ll be a while yet till I can speak about this current path. Still a ways to go, but getting there. I am grateful for those that have helped to mould my history; past, present and the future. “As my sufferings mounted I soon realized that there were two ways in which I could respond to my situation -- either to react with bitterness or seek to transform the suffering into a creative force. I decided to follow the latter course.”
~Martin Luther King Jr.

“Changing the memories that form the way we see ourselves also changes the way we view others. Therefore, our relationships, job performance, what we are willing to do or are able to resist, all move in a positive direction.”~Francine Shapiro; #EMDR

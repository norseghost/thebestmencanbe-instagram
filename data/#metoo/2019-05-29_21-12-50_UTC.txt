Repost from @goodnightout_vancouver • “Our Harassment text reporting has launched!!! How does it work?
This is a data-collection service. It is not a way to get help in case of emergency.

When you witness or experience harassment, text “creep off” to 778-800-3822. This phrase is what sets off the chain of questions asking for more details. Your submission is fast and anonymous.

In August, we’ll crunch the data and report back to our stakeholders. This info will be used to make spaces safer for everyone.

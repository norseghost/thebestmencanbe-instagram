The Fact that I overcame what killed most people proves to me that I am way stronger than I thought I was 💪🏾🔥🙌🏾. I’m not boasting, I’m just Thankful and Grateful unto God for keeping and preserving my life. 
My prayers goes out to those families who loss  someone due  to domestic violence. I am also praying for those dealing with abuse or in any type of abusive situation. God will give you a strategy to get out. 
I want to pray for you. DM your prayer request! 💜💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜 #isurvived #traumarecovery #healed #miracles #dosmeticviolence #abuse #deliverance

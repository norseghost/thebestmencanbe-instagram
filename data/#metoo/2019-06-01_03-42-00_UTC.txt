HELP MAKE STRANGULATION A FELONY AND STEP PARENTS PROTECTED UNDER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS IN EVERY STATE!

Trauma can happen to all of us. It can have the capacity to wreck our lives but know it's only temporary we all can heal. Our bodies want to heal.
Meditation has helped me heal my brain from trauma and traumatic brain injury. While it will never be what it was I am so much further than I was in my healing journey. *

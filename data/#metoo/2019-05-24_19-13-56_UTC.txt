We live in a world where certain phrases can make you squirm, 
We hope to never be in there place, 
We hope to never attract a harmful gaze. 
We are so quick to argue, 
Discussing who is the victim, 
Discussing what's wrong with the system. 
We are so angry at the world, 
Dealing with beings from the underworld. 
Not realizing that our war is one, 
Against those from whom we run. 
Who harm girls and boys, 
For whom we are mere toys. 
They give us nightmares, 
They think this right is theirs.

Stand up now, 
Speak out now. 
Why are you quiet? 
Why aren't you creating a riot? 
Scream! At the atrocities.
Stop the deaths due to monstrosities. 
Take a stand, I beg you, 
They're standing at the edge of heaven, 
Looking at us through and through, 
Past the skies of seven, 
They're hoping for us, 
To realize, 
To do, 
To save the ones that could join them too.

Why are you quiet now?
Why won't you speak?
Prevent the tears that could mar your cheeks, 
Help the families who may befall this, 
Help the girls who might not survive this, 
Help the boys who are silenced.

Speak, please, because they've gone too far, 
And we're still stuck arguing, 
Arguing about what's right and wrong. 
Human rights. That's all you need.
Right to a life. That's all you need.

Why are you quiet? What gives you the right?
I'm crumbling, and they're dead.
Their blood on our hands, painting us red.

Why are you quiet?
What are you waiting for? Another corpse, 
Another person to succumb to their sorts?

Why are you quiet?

I ask.

Why are you quiet? /-Rabia W/ @empathide

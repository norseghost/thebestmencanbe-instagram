"When a 200lb (90.72kg) man walks he exerts 20 psi (pounds per square inch) because the weight is supported momentarily by the heel. A 100lb (45.36kg) woman exerts many more psi when she wears heels. Depending on the area of the heel, she can exert as much as 1600 psi under a 'stiletto heel' ¼ inch on a side." (Bennett, Carole. Pressure versus Force: Landing on Ice!  25 May 2003)

This is an incredible statistic. Firstly because it is extraordinary what social convention expects of women. Secondly, because how many women weigh as little as 100 pounds?

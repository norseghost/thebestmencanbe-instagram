Expectations are pervasive in our lives, and most of us are conditioned to be driven by them and to attempt to realize them. 
Your life would be a ridiculous charade if you lived based on all of these expectations together.
You can’t possibly live a happy life while being strangled by these unrealistic expectations. Expectations are not genderbiased! Everyone faces their own set of burden of expectations.

Tell us about your experiences related to expectations. Did u accept them or did you overcame them.

I shared a quote this morning on my stories that has me reflecting something fierce. 
My self worth was determined by if I was able to do all the things. Take a break? Ask for help? Be ok with failure? Not a chance for this chick. Can anyone relate? 
I didn’t go searching for the feeling of overall health that I have now. As cheesy as it sounds, it found me. And layer by layer that small decision has made massive impacts on all the things that matter most to me, including my self worth. 
Getting to a point of being real with yourself and asking for some help may not come easy for you. But I’m proof that if you take some baby steps, so many doors that you never thought possible will start to open up.

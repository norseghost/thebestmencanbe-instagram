I am SO excited to share that Blessed Be The Brain now has its own website! I have bought the .com and plan on linking it tomorrow but was too impatient not to share it tonight 😂! On this site you can learn more about the brand, find our social handles, and most importantly our verified shop and styles.

There are now multiple sellers on Amazon copying our styles and even our name (which is kind of crazy for only being a week old) but can be very misleading to those who want to purchase our items knowing it goes to charity. There are people underselling us, overselling, copying exact styles without an oxford comma, and even misspelling!

All of our t-shirts, tanks, and youth shirts are $19.99, our long sleeve shirts are $23.99 and our sweatshirts are $30.99 in case you are worried!

As Hannah and I work to solve these issues, we’ve set up a Blessed Be The Brains Facebook page with ALL of our items individually linked so there is no confusion! You can simply search “Blessed Be The Brains” and our page should come up!

For now, I’ve provided a link to our website in our bio where you can scroll down the the button that says “shop all our styles” to find all of our designs! Go check out the site and let me know what you think 🧠✨

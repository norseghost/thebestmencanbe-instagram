I went garage sale-ing with @maggyadams10 this morning. I’ve had this outfit in mind for a while and since it was 50 degrees and quickly rising to 80 today it worked perfectly. The separates and the coat dress are pure silk - the miracle fiber! I love silk not just for its luxe hand feel but for how it adapts seamlessly to keep you cool in warm weather and warm in cool weather. Because of that quality, I actually get quite a lot of wear year round out of an otherwise “occasion” piece like a bright yellow floor length coat dress. It’s also a lifesaver fabric for my severe temperature fluctuations brought on by chronic illness. The floral crop top and matching skirt are such a fun pairing with the coat, as it’s an interesting play on transparency without wearing anything sheer. The frog closures and the green in the floral print inspired me to add a green conical straw hat which is a fab summer statement piece. My shoes had to be just as bright, so I wore red perforated suede wedges which have a great 40’s retro vibe. Since everything else I had on was a pop of color I kept my jewelry simple with sterling and inlaid malachite long screwback earrings from the 1920’s and a 1950’s #hattiecarnegie brooch from my great grandmother that I restored. My handbag is by @aumi_4. You may have noticed it in previous outfits - it can be worn as a clutch with the lucite handle or a shoulder bag with the leather strap. Add the chain strap and it’s long enough to be worn crossbody. This was a gift from a friend and I’m so grateful because I wouldn’t have chosen it for myself but I absolutely love it! 
It’s also worth noting that this outfit would retail for $1500+ but my cost was less than $30. It is 100% ethically made/sourced and truly proves that budget is no barrier to style. There is no excuse for fast fashion that might as well have a #metoo label sewn in it. If I can do it, you can do it too! It’s worth the extra effort, I promise 😘 📸: @maggyadams10

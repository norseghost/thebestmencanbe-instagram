What are you holding on to because it feels too difficult to let go? ➡️ Secrets
➡️ Guilt
➡️ Shame

When you woke up this morning and looked at your 📲, did the SAME thought plaque you as it has for the past decade?

Are you now comfortable in your chain⛓

You are stronger than you think, loved more than you know, and worthy of ALL.GOOD.THINGS! 💃

Find someone you trust TODAY and share your secret. 🗣 Bring that {dark} 🌑 thing into the light 💡 and watch the power that it had over you start to dissolve in a moment!

Difficult...yes!
Worth it....yes!
Freeing....double YES!!! Don’t miss out on your {FREEDOM} 🙌 just because the road to get there seems difficult. 👊It’s worth it...I promise!👊 And if #abortion is your ‘thing’ that keeps you from moving forward, I have a professional group of counselors that can help you sort through that. Message me and let’s get you the freedom you deserve AND desire! 💔❤️ No one warned me in 1987 of the “aftermath” of abortion...the guilt, the shame, the panic attacks, the depression, the anxiety, the fear of never being a mom...NONE OF IT. Once they got my money, they literally didn’t care about my LIFE. And I will spend the rest of my days warning other women of the horror of abortion while also offering hope for the “AFTER”. After 32 years of hiding, I am finally free.
🎶My chains are gone! I’ve been set free🎶

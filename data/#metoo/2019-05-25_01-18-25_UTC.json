A pointed finger is a victim\u2019s logo.\u201d \u2014 Joseph Brodsky\n\nBut I will proudly say that after more than 24 hours of excruciating labor, after a tumultuous gestation, I came into this world with both fingers pointed at the doctor, and then I shat on that man.\n.\nI didn\u2019t cry when I was born, and people have questioned my reasons any time I\u2019ve cried sense.\n.\nWhen you point your finger at a person, you are putting your energy into them. You are flooding them with your perspective. And then they\u2019ll have to reckon with it.\n.\nPoint your fucking fingers. Stomp your feet on the ground. Let them eat the poisons that they created in your body, themselves. That may be the best way for those poisons to make their way out.\n.\nAnd remember, we don\u2019t know what Jesus actually said. All we have is some 4th or 5th hand words about what he supposedly said \u2014 words written by men, with agendas. And translated by men. With agendas.\n.\n\u201cForgiveness,\u201d Jesus told me, \u201cis overrated. If you turn the other cheek, you are bringing suffering upon yourself.\u201d\n.\nMost of what you have been told were lies.\n.\nPay attention."

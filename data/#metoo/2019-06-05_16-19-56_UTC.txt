I am excited to announce that some of my Pin-Up Ladies mugs are now for sale at Lion Salon and Spa, in Norman!

@lionavedasalon is located at 3720 W. Robinson St., STE 130, Norman, OK, 73072. To find out more about their services and products, you may visit www.lionsalon.com or call (405)310-3003. 
The Pin-Up Ladies mug pictured here is wheel-thrown stoneware with a ceramic decal and real gold luster accents. Each mug in the collection has been through four firings to bring it to perfection, and I'm so proud of them. 
With all of the buzz over #metoo, #churchtoo, #ThisIsNotConsent, and #SexualAssaultAwarenessMonth (April), I have discovered that making pottery with flirty pin-up pictures on it is my favorite artistic way to join the conversation.

Simply put, a woman should be able to go wherever she wants, do whatever she wants, and wear whatever she wants, or nothing at all, without fear of being assaulted. That is the world I dream of.

Pin-up pictures also portray women simply loving life and themselves, feeling empowered and comfortable in their own skin. ‚ù§

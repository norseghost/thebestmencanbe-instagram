When someone is sexually abused, it stays with them for the rest of their life. You ask yourself why it happened and what you could have done to prevent it, when in reality someone STOLE something that DID NOT belong to them. You ARE NOT responsible for their actions. Sexual abuse is something that far too many women and men have had to endure.

This session means so much to Marissa and myself. It represents owning herself again. It represents self-love and triumph. And it represents the strength it takes to continue.

For anyone else who has gone through sexual abuse, you are a warrior, you are not alone, you are loved, and you are worthy.

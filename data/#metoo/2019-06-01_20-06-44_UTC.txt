“When this young paramedic Razan Alnajar🇵🇸💙 was assassinated by the criminal cruel snipers of the Israeli Apartheid None of the Republicans or Democrats that today run for the US Presidency ever criticized this heinous crime. Why should they? When the American Citizen Rachel Corrie🇺🇸💙 @rachelcorriefoundation  was assassinated crushed to her death under the bulldozer of the Apartheid State of Israel, these politicians remained silent and indifferent. So here once again the bloods of these 2 young women of Palestine🇵🇸 and The United States of America🗽🇺🇸 join together to spread shame on the face of those politicians that never stood up for Human Rights. All they were ever interested in  was our votes and the apartheid money.”R.F.

Repost from @we_are_not_numbers 
It is the first anniversary of the Israeli killing of the Palestinian nurse, Razan Alnajar, 22. She was killed while volunteering to save the injured Palestinians' lives while they were demanding their right of return at the eastern borders of Gaza.

For Palestinians, Razan remains a model and an icon for her bravery and dedication.

Must be fuck'n nice. It's ironic how #MeToo and tons of women (especially "black" women) who came in droves to crucify Bill Cosby over allegations are as quiet as whores in church on this issue. Ironic, but not surprising.â–ªï¸ŽThe energy ain't the same, and it's clear that ANYONE can be bought, especially if your white and connected.â–ªï¸ŽThis dude has physical evidence of his wrongdoing and is allowed to negotiate his innocence. â–ªï¸ŽHis attorney sounds like a slimeball... And the funniest part about all of this is the space these womens lib movements haven given Weinstein and so many other white men (which is appropriate per code). Incredible. #FreeBillCosby #WatchEverythingðŸ‘€

The new era of Advocators and Young Activists. üí•
.
We are so inspired by these youth activists and this campaign, how the young generation is actively advocating "Good" for our planet and society by making their voices heard. .

"There have been protests about immigration, scientific advancement, gender equality, climate change, police brutality, looming dictatorships, #MeToo and #TimesUp, the list goes on. While each cause may be different, we all yearn for common things: justice, equality, and perhaps most importantly ‚Äì peace. In this exclusive editorial for @schonmagazine , photographer @aralereartesv and producer @sheri.chiu capture real activists who share their stories below." cit. Sheri Chiu .

‚ÄúI felt this need to do something bigger, something that was more impactful and felt that being a model was a great platform,‚Äù Wuestenberg describes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve chosen my career as a platform to bring a bigger conscious awareness to people. I‚Äôve always been very attached to the ocean. Just being by it is where I feel the most peace and love. I find a lot of enjoyment out of protecting the ocean and that‚Äôs where it needs to start. You need to start with what makes you feel good.‚Äù .

Fashion is one of the most important yet most polluting industries in the world for now. Are we all inspired by young role models to start working on a new sustainable fashion system?

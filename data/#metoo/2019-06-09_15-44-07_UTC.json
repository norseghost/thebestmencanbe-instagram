                        "text": "I rolled out of bed, took the dog for a walk and went to IKEA first thing this morning, to get some bits for the kitchen. Sadly I grabbed a rubbish trolley, and spent most of my walk round cursing it in my head and sweating from holding two of the wheels in the air so it would move smoothly. At one point, a young male IKEA employee came up to me - hurrah, he is going to rustle up a trolley solution, I thought to myself. \u201cHi there, I just wanted to tell you, you\u2019re really pretty.\u201d . . . . . \u201cOh...thank you\u201d I said, and moved off, fairly shocked given my bedtime pineapple hair, \u2018mad girl\u2019 t shirt and general scary morning face. Now I\u2019ve not been on the dating/meeting people scene for some time, and am certainly not au fait with being approached by men, but I was even more surprised when he didn\u2019t let me walk off, he walked alongside me asking questions about where I live and how often I\u2019m around that area. I gave really none existent answers and was definitely giving serious \u201cleave me alone\u201d non verbal communication, but he didn\u2019t leave until I finally leapt on a nearby travelator. I was really flustered, and in hindsight annoyed about the whole situation, not least because my search for an escape had taken me past a number of items I needed (and sadly, I didn\u2019t have the courage to go back for fear he would think I was interested). I wish I had had the confidence to say \u201cthank you, I\u2019m flattered but I\u2019m just here to browse on my own\u201d - I could have mentioned being in a long term relationship but I don\u2019t feel that should be a card anyone needs to play if they don\u2019t want attention. I would never blame a guy for trying, but I felt really uncomfortable about the whole thing - the compliment was weird enough when I looked well as I did, but then to not be able to read the signals was a bit unforgivable. I cheered myself up with an M&S chicken and stuffing sandwich in the car, something I haven\u2019t eaten in a really long time because obviously chicken = danger, and even though I used a sandwich bag to touch the food, I congratulated myself on a win under the adverse circumstances. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\n.\n.\n.\n#emetophobia #ocd #emetophocd #mentalhealth #cbt #recovery #emdr #therapy"

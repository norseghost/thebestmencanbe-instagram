The VEIL of Leadership SHAME that so many women leaders wear.... You're in a new position and you're finding yourself in over your head... Crying because you don't know what you're doing... Questioning how you got the position or whether you should even be in the position... Unsure what direction to take... Will I be judged... Will it be the "right" decision... You know that you want to be and do more but you're hesitant on sharing your goals... Scared to take risks... Scared to invest in yourself... Scared to be the leader you really aspire to be... Flooded with self-doubt, confusion, fear, and shame.

You feel stuck... You're questioning everything in your career and yourself as a leader... Ladies!  It's time to drop the VEIL of Leadership Shame!

YOU are a LEADER

YOU don't need to know it all

YOU can be the leader you aspire to be.

Believe... With belief comes courage... With courage comes the ability to DARE TO LEAD.

Don't let fear lead you... Let courage, self-compassion, authenticity, and self-awareness be your leaders.

DO Dare to lead and to be the leader you aspire to be.

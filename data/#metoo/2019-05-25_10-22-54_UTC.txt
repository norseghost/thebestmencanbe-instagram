Today marked the end of my hell

I have been manipulated, threatened and ground down to within an inch of my existence feeling powerless and worthless to make change.

I have been kicked down the stairs

I have been attacked in my own home

I have lost contact with my children due to safety.

I have lost count at the amount of black eyes I have received 
My scars run deep

My eyes are puffy from fighting for my life

I tried to stay and fix it

my attempts seldom worked

entering back into the cycle of co-dependency.

But I started biting back

I started mirroring behaviour

turning into someone I hated too

Did I become the other

Was it me all along?

I decided to BREAK FREE... I was attacked in my own home

I was trying to get my friends back 
I fought back, I fought for my freedom

I was attacked with a barbell 
but I got my freedom... I was attacked again and all my possessions were destroyed I needed medical attention for the injuries I sustained over one weekend... I am weak

I am powerless

I am sad

I am lonely

But.... I AM FREE

I spoke out finally and asked for help

but a week on and: •I have photographed my own injuries •I have only had telephone conversations with officers. •They said they would come and see me and they haven't. •The domestic violence team said they would visit.... But haven't 
I feel lonely

I feel sad

I feel powerless

Should I stop talking?

Will it go away?

Will they come back again?

Am I REALLY FREE? 
Ignorance and injustice rarely last in sunlight and this is that day of sunshine!

This is a common story for MALE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE

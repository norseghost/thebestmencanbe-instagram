From @meztliprojects -  Indian Country Today found that Native people and organizations, like their mainstream counterparts, are not immune from using the male privileges and protections of wealth, power, and social status to prey on the vulnerable.

Nor are they immune from the desire to cover up these unpleasant facts. “The MeToo movement has skipped Indian Country,” said Amanda Takes War Bonnet, public education specialist for the Native Women’s Society of the Great Plains.

Takes War Bonnet of the Oglala Lakota Nation said Native women don’t report sexual harassment or assault because they believe their communities won’t support them and little will be done. “Constant racism, sexual and domestic violence, childhood trauma, lack of accountability from tribal law enforcement and court systems and not being believed if they do come forward has contributed to silencing Native women,” she said.

When healing from eating disorders, trauma, pregnancy, or mental illness, the relationship with your body is impacted. .
Just like interpersonal relationships thrive with boundaries, your relationship with your body does too.
.
If your body is in physical pain, shutting down, not engaging with you, or simply not functioning to the level you desire, consider that as your BODY SETTING A BOUNDARY. .
Your body needs a break, it needs rest, it needs a new movement, an assist in the movement, nourishment, or just some positive validation. .
ITS NOT YOUR BODIES FAULT. .
If you can honor your bodyâ€™s boundaries, it will heal, reset, and allow you to re-engage with it differently. .

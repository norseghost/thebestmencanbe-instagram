National treasure Anita Hill spoke at @wellesleycollege ’s commencement ceremonies last week.  A few favorite quotes: ⁣
⁣⁣
⁣“And yet, there are those who would have us believe that the stories and statistics, showing the prevalence of sexual misconduct are a hoax. They prefer to believe in their own myths, often misogynist, about the behavior.”⁣
⁣⁣
⁣“So the problem is not just with the behavior, it’s the enabling that goes along with it.”⁣
⁣⁣
⁣“And despite the evidence, sexual misconduct deniers have friends in high places.” After pausing for a raucous response from the crowd, she continued, “But not just *that* place.”⁣
⁣⁣
⁣“But we are fortunate, we outnumber them.  We are louder than they are … and we are ready to take them on.”⁣

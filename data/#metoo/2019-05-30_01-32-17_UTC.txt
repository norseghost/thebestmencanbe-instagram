A couple weeks ago, I met these two awesome guys - Shawn and Greg - and had a lively discussion about poverty, sexual harassment, and Arkansas :). They let me know they had a podcast called, "Two Black Sheep" (@twoblacksheeplive ), and we subsequently discussed my coming on to talk further about sexual harassment.

I did :). We had a great talk and you can hear it here:  https://www.buzzsprout.com/248735 
I'm really grateful for the experience and proud of the end-result. I think you'll enjoy it, too :). We had a fun, engaging conversation about "catcalling" and the sexual objectification it both arises from, as well as inspires. We talked about what it feels like to be constantly watched by men on the street, and what male allies can do to combat the discomfort (and outright fear, at times) that arises from the constant staring and "catcalling". #metoo #podcast #sexualharrassment #woman #womenempowerment #womanofcolor #woc #twoblacksheep #respect #respectwomen #strongwomen #safety #catcalling #smileformebaby

The problem with rich white women like @kyliejenner is that they’re tone deaf as fuck. People like Kylie will always have access to not only healthcare but to emergency services like abortions. For her to throw a Handmaids Themed party is beyond tone deaf. Maybe the filler is rotting her young brain but, you don’t throw a party like this, you throw a fundraiser and you give all the proceeds to fighting for women’s reproduce rights across the globe.

When did society decide women’s beauty was defined by skin colour?? Our skin comes in millions of wonderful colours and shades and textures and pigments.

Western society seems to have decided that a smooth honey golden shade of tanned skin is the most desirable. Leaving, I guesstimate, 90% of women apparently less desirable with their natural skin colour.

And let’s be clear. This isn’t just about white women slathering themselves with pricey fake tan and getting harmful sunbeds to gain that ‘perfect’ skin colour. This is about black women not being able to buy foundation in their skin tone. This is about Asian women using skin whitening cream. This is about society excluding billions of women from what they have decided is deemed beautiful.

Give me all types of gorgeous skin. Give me all shades, all the scars, all the moles, all the lines and wrinkles and everything in between. That’s what we need to see on our TVs and in our magazines.

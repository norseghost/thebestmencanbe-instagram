A child laying on her bed in her room does not mean an invitation for a family member to violate her. #letchildrenbechildren Welcome to our community page. This is a platform for abused children to share their story. /
/

This page is for abused children to post their abuser. Post full names, location, Photos and all the details that you can remember. False reporters will be prosecuted to the full extent of the Law where ever you are posting from. THIS IS NOT A JOKE🙏🏼😢💔 /
/

This is not a page for NUN-BELIEVERS to bash victims. If a “VICTIM” post you here as an abuser and you feel that you have been falsely accused please DM us so we can investigate the matter on your behalf. We will not tolerate you bashing your accuser here. /

If you are currently being abused and need help escaping your situation DM us now and we will try to help you. /

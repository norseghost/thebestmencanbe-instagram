In this photograph I am sitting outside of the dorm room where I was raped. 
I wanted to take some graduation photos here because it is what felt like an authentic representation of my growth and experience in college. 
Looking at these photos truly reminded me of why I started this account. (also can we just acknowledge that this is actually me and I'm posting it here, eek) I wanted to truly dig deep and confront some of my most complex and personal feelings about my rape. Over time, as I have come to settle into my identity and life as a survivor, my mission has grown with me. I want to give myself and other survivors a spare to share their stories and feelings authentically, and I want to be sure I am always posting with that mission in mind. I haven't posted in a while because I did not want to out of only a feeling of obligation, but rather I want to post out of a desire to connect and inspire. 
That being said, I just recorded for an upcoming episode on the @thephgpodcast and felt truly empowered and inspired to reach out and connect with you all again. I will post a link to the podcast when it is out if you want to listen.
Comment below: Do you ever post out of a feeling of obligation as opposed to genuine inspiration? Or comment a ðŸ’– if you read this far. Love you guys.

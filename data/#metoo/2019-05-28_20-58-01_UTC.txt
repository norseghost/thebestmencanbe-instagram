Join me June 8th. I will be a keynote speaker for RUFS. My voice will serve as an advocate for the endless victims of sexual assault and abuse that suffer in silence. Together we WALK & Together we break the SILENCE. We RISE UP...TOGETHER!

You are NOT ALONE! I will keep fighting for you EVERY day!! ðŸ’–

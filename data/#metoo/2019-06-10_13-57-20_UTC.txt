Part 1 (English follows Japanese) 
全てが終わった後、私にはもう何も残されていない。彼のことは一生許せない。知らない人でさえ彼よりもましだ。たとえ彼が空気であったとしても、私は息すらしないだろう。彼がどうしてあんなことをしたのか、彼の立場から理解しようとしたが、すでに起こってしまった事と闘うのはエネルギーの無駄だと気付いた。だから私はこんな風に考えている:これ以上痛みを感じるべきではない、と心に決めた時、その痛みの元凶は意味を持たなくなるのだ、と。自分の現実を自分で支配できるようになれば、もはや彼らはあなたにとってリアルなものではなくなる。許すことは大事だと言われるが、許すことで自身の健やかさが犠牲になることもある。許せないことを無理に許すこと、それがわたしを傷つける。私には、未だに人を信用することは難しいけれど、ただ一つ言えることは、私たちはこんな目に合うべきじゃないということだ。

With everything that happened, I have nothing left. He’s dead to me. A stranger would have a better place in my heart than him. Even if he was air, I wouldn't breathe him in. I was so obsessed with trying to be empathetic in understanding why he did it, but it’s such a waste of energy trying to fight what happened. That’s why I have this philosophy: the moment you decide you don't deserve to feel the pain anymore, anything that causes it is going to have no real significance. If you get to dictate your reality, they will stop being real to you. People talk about forgiveness, but forgiveness can happen at the expense of your own well being. Forgiving the inexcusable things he did would harm me. It’s still hard for me to have faith in humanity, but all I can say is that we don't deserve this.

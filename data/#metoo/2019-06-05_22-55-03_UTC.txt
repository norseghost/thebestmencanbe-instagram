While on a Norwegian Air flight from Rio to London this week, I was sexually assaulted by the man sitting next to me. He was touching me in my sleep, and I luckily woke up and stopped him.

At first this wasn’t something I was comfortable sharing publicly, and would prefer to keep it private because I am embarrassed and still upset. I do not want special attention from this or anything, really. However, I feel that it needs to be shared, if for nothing else, to spread awareness because this happens more often than you’d imagine. I also feel that by not sharing my story is making what he did okay, which is absolutely not the case. 
My body is not public property. My body is not for anyone to touch or comment on as they please. My body is just that- MY body. 
I’ve written the whole story of what happened on my blog.
Thanks for the love and support.

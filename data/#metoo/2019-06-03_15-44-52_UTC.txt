Today, we are taking Brisket, our beef cow, to the butcher. This is the first beef cow we have raised on our own. There is pure joy in raising our own beef and knowing exactly how he’s been fed and treated. Our Amish friends came to help load and my friend, Howard, is hauling him for us. I love this small community we are blessed to be part of for this season in life! And I’m so thankful for all the meat we are getting ready to load in our freezer! #beef #homesteading #countrylife #smallcommunities

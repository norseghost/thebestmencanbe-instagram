If you are in a place where you can safely do so, take in a deep breath.  As you slowly exhale, close your eyes.  As you comfortably breathe in and out, focus on feeling your heart beat.  Block out everything else going on and just focus on your beating heart and your breathing.

Look within.  If you felt you were worthy, what would you do with your life?  Donâ€™t force the answer.  Let it come to you naturally.  Keep focusing on your heart and your breathing.  What does your heart say?  What would you do if you felt you were worthy?

Take in a deep breath and slowly exhale.  Slowly open your eyes.  What did you come up with?  How far off is it from your current life?  Spend some time planning on how to make it real - because you are worthy.

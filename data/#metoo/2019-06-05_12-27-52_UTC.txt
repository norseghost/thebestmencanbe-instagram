"Healing is not linear" but I'm processing a lot of trauma through poetry. I've written 29 pages in the past two days and today has just risen. Will be updating my blog soon (link in bio). Thankful for "Poetic Medicine" by John Fox, "Healing Sex" Staci Haines, "Pleasure Activism" adrienne maree brown, and "Survivors on the Yoga Mat" by Becky Thompson as being my current companions to lend pages composing a shoulder for me to sob, scream, and release. I'm thankful to be in a place where I can address the abuse, the assaults, the cutting, the stalking, the self-hatred, and suicide attempts. I may be broken but that doesn't mean I'm not whole. #healing #ISurvived #metoo #heal #silence #1in4 #PoeticMedicine #HealingSex #PleasureActivism #SurcivorsOnTheYogaMat #yoga #writing #reflection #growth #healingisnotlinear #sobbing #survive #survivor #domesticviolence #abuse #suicide #selfharm #compassion #loveyourself #notalone #Release #Anesce #originalpoem #originalwork

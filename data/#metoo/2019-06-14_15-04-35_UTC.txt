In March 2018, Arte Sana drafted the national Spanish language ‘Latinas and the #MeToo/#YoTambién Movement’ survey in collaboration with ALAS - Alianza Latina en contra la Agresión Sexual - in which 121 bilingual Latinx victim advocates participated. 
As word of the 2020 census citizenship question began to make the news, we decided to include a specific open-ended question en español regarding the possible impact of this, especially considering the theme of the survey.

This summary image reflects the 109 responses regarding how adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census might impact victim advocacy efforts. The responses were collected right before #SAAM 2018. #2020census #censuscitizenshipquestion

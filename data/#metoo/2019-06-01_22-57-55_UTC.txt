@naghmehspanahi thank you for sharing your story of escaping the bondage of abuse. You are so right-“Jesus came to rescue the person, not the institute.” Sadly the institute has powerful blowback, but abuse is never okay. Our silence enables the perpetrator and destroys our spirit. Ladies, tell your stories.  Nothing will change if we don’t. #domesticviolence #abuse #marriage #divorce #advocacy #nomore #church #metoo #churchtoo

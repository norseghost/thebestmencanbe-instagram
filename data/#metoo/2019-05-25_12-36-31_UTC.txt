That PAIN came for PURPOSE!  Don’t let it  bury you !  What you’re surrounded by you can become!  What you constantly think about you become .  As a man thinks in his heart so is he.  God knows about the pain but still tells us in His word to think on things that are NOBLE , GOOD and PRAISEWORTHY!  RISE up out of pain by not leaning to your own understanding but TRUSTING that God’s word won’t return void !  God has a plan for your life and that is to give you HOPE , a FUTURE , not harm you and to PROSPER you!  Let HIS plan play out HOW He intended for HIS GLORY!  Let pain work together for your GOOD!

CRISTIANO RONALDO
Why has the world gone easy on him?
The soccer superstar is under investigation in the U.S. for an alleged rape, but the case has been largely met with silence.

In late September, an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga told that Ronaldo had anally raped her during a 2009 party in a Las Vegas hotel room. After the assault, she explained, she had accepted hush money from him and tried to move on with her life. 
Unlike so many other high-profile men accused of sexual misconduct over the past year, Ronaldo has faced little backlash from soccer fans, corporate sponsors, the media, or the general public. AMAZING!

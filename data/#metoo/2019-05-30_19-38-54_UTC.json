                        "text": "Yes--You read that right.  I just got back from the Las Vegas jail with our team from Hookers For Jesus for our weekly Ladies Of Destiny class we teach in the detention center. .\n\nMany of the ladies sign up for our class because they are looking for solutions to their lives being out of control. Many have been arrested for prostitution related charges--and some have done other crimes stemming from prostitution.  We all know that most of this is actually related to sex trafficking, and the abuse that has been perpetrated upon them. .\n\nOnce we start sharing about sex trafficking--the causes, the symptoms, and signs of being trafficked, major lightbulbs go off in each ladie's minds, and we see their eyes light up.  They are discovering that they were victimized!\n.\nAfter the ladies prayer requests, we all sang a song together by Lauren Daigle, called \"You Say.\" It is powerful! Read these lyrics: . \"I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I\u2019m not enough\nEvery single lie that tells me I will never measure up\nAm I more than just the sum of every high and every low?\nRemind me once again just who I am, because I need to know .\n\nYou say I am loved when I can\u2019t feel a thing\nYou say I am strong when I think I am weak\nYou say I am held when I am falling short\nWhen I don\u2019t belong, oh You say that I am Yours\nAnd I believe (I), oh I believe (I)\nWhat You say of me (I)\nI believe\n.\n\nThe only thing that matters now is everything You think of me\nIn You I find my worth, in You I find my identity\" .\n\nAs I was singing with the ladies today, (and very loud--LOL) I was closing my eyes. And I heard several ladies crying, and one lady in particular completely lost it, and started sobbing almost uncontrollably. It was heart wrenching. \nFor more read out link in our bio! .\n.\n#prison #prisonoutreach #jesusisreal #lovethem #ministry #realtalk #keepitreal #givelove #giveittogod #godisgood #godseesall #sextrafficking #prostitution #freedom #metoo #weare #nevadastrong #ccdc #ladiesofdestiny #hookersforjesus #annielobert #emotionalabuse #nomore #sexualabuse #setfree"

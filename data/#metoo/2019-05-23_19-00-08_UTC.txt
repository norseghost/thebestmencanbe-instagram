The #MeToo movement is pretty powerful in the sense of one being vulnerable enough to admit what others are secretly dealing with on a daily basis! The power of your testimony is so liberating not only for you but for those who hear it!  Today we want to challenge #Moms all around the world to become so #confident within themselves that you’re able to encourage others who are secretly admitting (#MeToo)! It’s enough going on in the world that causes one to be bound! Don’t allow your “situation” to keep you! What you’re dealing with ... OTHERS have too! Set yourself free! #ownit #testify#encourageyourself #encourageothers #bettertogether #metoo #momminguniversity #momlife #moms #networkofmoms

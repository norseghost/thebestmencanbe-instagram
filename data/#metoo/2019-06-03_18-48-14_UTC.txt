Bring a feminist doesn’t mean trying to be greater, it means trying to be equal. We want equality not superiority. Don’t let people talk down to you because of your gender, race, or sexual orientation. Live your life to the fullest. I am here for all of you! Stay strong and keep the fight going! #metoo #metoomovement #timesup

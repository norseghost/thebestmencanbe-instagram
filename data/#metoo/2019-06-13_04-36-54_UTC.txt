For all the women out there struggling with their bodies postpartum- #Metoo (too soon?)⁣
⁣
 Went to get clothes today because nothing fits me. Ended up crying in the dressing room at target. From a size 2/4 to a size 10. ⁣
There’s no great message here besides this ‘you’re not alone.’ And, in the midst of your body shifting and changing know that it’s okay to be bummed. I think we too often are forced to look at our child and tell ourselves because that was our reward it was worth it...and it is. But it’s okay to be bummed. Not because you’re not good enough in this state but because it’s healthy to be honest with your feelings. We don’t live there. We don’t let them dictate our lives but we get to be honest with them. ⁣
⁣
So, here I am 4 weeks postpartum. Embracing the process. Embracing the reality that things may never be the same. Learning to be okay with it, knowing I’d choose it a million times again to get her but being honest as I journey through it and hopefully encouraging you to find freedom to do the same.

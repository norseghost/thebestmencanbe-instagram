As a woman #filmmaker in #Hollywood, watching this landmark #documentary affected me in a few ways, from inspiration to anger to empathy and compassion for all the women who’ve come before me and fought their way to get this far. The most meaningful one was a CALL TO ACTION to get out there and focus and push forward to tell more stories about  50% OF THE PLANET’S POPULATION. And to hire, inspire, mentor and uplift more #womeninfilm. Sincerest thanks and gratitude to @GDIGM and everyone who so courageously shared their stories on screen and the team behind the scenes who made this happen including phenomenal director Tom Donahue.

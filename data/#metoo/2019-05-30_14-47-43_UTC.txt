This week @readoctober is celebrating the women of beer and I’m so pleased to have created this artwork for it. I highly recommend reading all the pieces featuring @hopewellbrewing, @ladyjusticebrewing, and more.

“We can no longer wait around for these conversations to just happen on their own. Nearly every industry has been forced to take a hard look at itself in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and beer should be no exception. Garden-variety sexism still lingers in both the macro and craft worlds, from sexualized marketing to sexism in the workplace.
.
It’s up to all of us to hold the industry accountable, and to signal-boost the amazing women who are changing it for the better, from grain to glass. So please join us as we raise a toast to honor the women of beer, both now and in the future.”

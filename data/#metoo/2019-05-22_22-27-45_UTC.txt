The weather in SoCal has been crazy lately. Totally not complaining, I love it when it’s cooler and rainy. On days like today I love a good soup. I’m a chicken noodle or minestrone soup kind of girl, while William loves clam chowder and French onion soup. Do you enjoy soup on rainy days? What’s your favorite kind of soup?

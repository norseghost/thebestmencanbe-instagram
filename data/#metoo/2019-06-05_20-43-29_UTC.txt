Unspoken Battles with the Trans Community & Sexual Assault

Full Intevriew in Apr/May 2019 issue of Toi Magaizne(link in bio):
@oklexiebean "I am always seeking more trans inclusion when it comes to conversations around sexual abuse. From getting turned away from shelters, to staying in abusive relationships because our bodies are "confusing" or "unlovable," the increase in visibilityÂ over the past few years has not protected us. 
Trans women are the most likely to be murdered, and meanwhile trans men are the most likely to commit suicide.Â Many trans men and assigned female at birth trans people do not speak on their survivor status. 
As an assigned female at birth trans person, I have been told many times that both my gender and sexual orientation are the result of my childhood abuse. This is not true. In fact, I would have come out much earlier as transgender had I not had my body and boundaries constantly policed. 
I would have come out much earlier about being a survivor had I not had to worry about having my identity scrutinized or limited to womanhood." Â·

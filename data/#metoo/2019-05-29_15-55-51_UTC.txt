It’s really amazing how conditioned our brains are to receive and accept information. We agree with “facts” that we’ve not truly discovered. We are influenced by visuals that are someone else’s design. 
When you can snap yourself out of your own conditioning, or see how influence isn’t just on the gram. It’s what we allow in. It’s what we feel connected to. It’s blind faith. It’s knowing without knowing. We are all brainwashed in our education and social constructs. What even is truth?

And yet we rise to discover for ourselves the meaningful. We feel, and often that is our guiding force. When those thoughts are positive, it is radiance we are connecting to, and that is truth. When turned negative, we are pulled into fear, anger, and confusion and that is truth. 
Truth is not always fact. And fact is not always true. So, while the melding of these ideas sounds like more confusion, it is essential to CLARITY. To distinguish between what you know. What you think you know. And what you might need to question.

Inviting our minds to snap out of knee jerk reactions, and ask more questions. Observe with new eyes, and try to detach from old thinking and exterior influence. Question and answer and question some more.

This morning’s highlight: “Anita Hill Won’t Back Down,” interviewed by NYT’s Gender Editor Jessica Bennett. 
Anita Hill had many quietly powerful things to say. What struck me with the most impact was her answer to why it’s taken so long after the SC hearings in 1991 to get to #metoo. She said, “this work is not about just trying to get rid of a few bad apples. It’s about changing cultures that systems of power are set up to protect. And culture change is hard. It takes a long time.” I couldn’t agree more.

And, as Jessica Bennett said so well at the top of the conversation, “It’s not about changing women, it’s about changing the rules .”

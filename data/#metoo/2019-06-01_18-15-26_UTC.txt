I can't come to understand when the system we live in should be stopping crime and protect us yet they ain't is like they want to turn us in victims knowing that if you or I should get rape and have to carry a rapist child for a whole nine months when it could be done away with before anything forms inside me is like I'm a live with this for the rest of my life what if I end up carry that child the the rapist is out their stacking me and thing you'll government ain't doing anything about it what if at the age of 11 I get rape and have a child 95% of the time we end up not getting no government help to carry on with our life why you'll ain't go out there and help us stop rape and say no to it I guess not because the person who made this law maybe got rape and had to carry a rapist and they want the rest of us go through it or this is a rapist who want the law like this to over other rapist foot step we need a change

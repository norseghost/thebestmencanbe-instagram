Out of the #MeToo era came a greater awareness for sexual and physical assault that has affected nearly every industry; cosmetology is no exception. At Salon Success Academy, we’ve always been a people-helping company. So, when the State of California enacted a new law that requires all cosmetology schools to provide training in physical and sexual abuse awareness for all licensees, we were fully on board. Of course, we wanted to help our students, clients, and the community!⁣

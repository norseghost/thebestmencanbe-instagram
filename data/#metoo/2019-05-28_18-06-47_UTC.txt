#repost @resistancerevivalchorus YOU DON'T OWN ME ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We released this cover of Lesley Gore's famous feminist anthem last year in support of the #MeToo movement. Today we are blasting it on repeat in support of a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body as reproductive healthcare rights are being stripped in states across the country in an attempt to take down #RoevWade. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Please know that 73% of Americans, including majorities in both parties, support the right to choose, and that abortion is still available in the states that have recently voted to restrict it (AL, AK, GA, IN, KY, MS, OH, UT, and counting). Their draconian laws don't go into effect until January 2020 — if ever, if the ACLU has anything to say about it. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In the meantime, here's what you can do: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1. Donate & Support @yellowfund @abortionfunds @sistersong_woc @fairfightaction @arc_southeast @prochoiceamerica @feministcenter @fairfightaction
2. Volunteer as a clinic escort, walking patients seeking healthcare past protestors and into clinics → @plannedparenthood 
3. Support the ACLU. It has a history of defeating Alabama in cases like this → @aclu_nationwide @acluofalabma
4. If you live in a state considering restrictive abortion laws (LA, MO, MN, OK, TX) or legislation to bolster abortion rights (VT, RI, IL, NV, NM), call your reps NON-STOP
5. Pay attention to federal judicial appointments and call your Senators to vote NO on anti-choice judges
6. Register to vote, and not just for president. Vote out the state lawmakers who pass anti-abortion laws and fight the gerrymandered maps that have allowed many of them to win their races unfairly → @votesaveamerica
7. WOMEN: 1 in 4 have had an abortion. Tell your story if you're comfortable. Use #youknowme. Your stories help normalize abortion and reproductive care.
8. MEN: Show support online and in your relationships with women. Did you dodge early fatherhood or support a partner, friend or relative in an abortion? Please speak up. Women don't get pregnant alone. Your voices are powerful.

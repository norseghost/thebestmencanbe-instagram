I am deeply moved by #noapothoven 's story and send my deepest condolences to her family and friends.üñ§
I can understand her pain so well. Suffering from #complexptsd and #chronicaldepression is a constant fight which I am fighting myself. You wake up in the morning to fight. You go to bed, say your prayers and know tomorrow will be a day of fighting again. I respect her wish and hope she found the relief of pain and suffering she was longing for so desperately. Noa I hope you found your peace‚ù§Ô∏èüïØÔ∏è

On February 28, 2019, the Senate of Canada passed a motion unanimously calling on the Government of Canada to bring into force the outstanding provisions of Bill S-3 in order to eliminate the remaining sex discrimination in the Indian Act.

Yesterday the Minister of Status of Women @MaryamMonsefMP and Prime Minister @JustinPJTrudeau could have issued an order-in-council that proclaims the clauses into law. Once proclaimed through an order-in-council they immediately become law and there is no requirement for them to go through the Senate and the House of Commons.

Instead Trudeau took to the international stage to proclaim that Canadians can feel reassured that the federal government will continue to stand "unequivocally" for women's rights and the right to choose, and that people around the world can know they "will always have an ally and a defender in Canada." .

So I guess our feminist PM is good with Native women having autonomy over their bodies in regards to the choice to give birth but when it comes to deciding the future of their children the Canadian government is all up in their shit. .

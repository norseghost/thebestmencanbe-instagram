“Popular cinema largely represents popular taste and there are given roles women have to subscribe to. That is reflected behind the camera, too” - cinematographer and director @fowziafathima

Fowzia is a member of Women in Cinema Collective: a groundbreaking feminist group in Kerala, India, which formed in support of an actor colleague who was sexually assaulted - and before the #timesup campaign in Hollywood. It was amazing to meet these women (and in the case of two of them, work together on a film and become great friends!) who are tirelessly fighting against misogyny in their industry, despite intense backlash. And it's starting to pay off: in February the Kerala government announced nearly 430,000 USD in funding for women filmmakers. Link to my full @cnn story in bio 💪📽️

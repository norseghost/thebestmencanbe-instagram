Life is all about evolution. What looks like a mistake to others has been a milestone in my life.
. 
Even if people have betrayed me, even if my heart was broken, even if people misunderstood or judged me, I have learned from these incidents. We are human and we make mistakes, but learning from them is what makes the difference.

Be the change 
Act now

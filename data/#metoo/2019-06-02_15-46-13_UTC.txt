My mom was watching this episode of Super Dancer : Chapter 3 and this little girl, the one in the picture was asked to dance to a seductive song and in a seductive way, which I found to be very weird. Lmao I don't wanna be a "SJW" but by following a simple logic, here's my reason, Each dance has certain motifs, some tell a story while some express an energy/emotion or it's form. Like many classical dance forms aim at telling folk tales and what not, in the same way, some dance forms were made to express or convey or arise sexual tension and energy in the room, from traditional monarch times. So, for us to ask a little kid to do the same and argue that she must not be looked at with a lustfull glance defeats the purpose of the dance and music, which kills the art. I mean, morality isn't something we should be really expecting from Bollywood but still. Lights-Camera-Action.ðŸ‘³ðŸŽ¬ðŸ‘Œ

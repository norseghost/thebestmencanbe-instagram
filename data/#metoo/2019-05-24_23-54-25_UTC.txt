It’s been really tough having a ‘Hidden Difference’ or ‘Hidden Disfigurement’. Since speaking with people who are told to ‘cover up’ or naturally cover up because it’s on a part of their body that’s not visible, every one of them seem to suffer severely with their mental wellbeing. It’s really important that we talk about this subject as it’s often forgotten or ignored. Myself and others have never felt part of a community. I will do my utmost to help support & encourage those who have all those bad unwanted feelings. It’s unhealthy to think it’s ok to throw on an outfit and carry on as normal. Anyone who knows my story will understand that doing just that made me want to give up on life. We should all feel that we belong somewhere and have someone to share our emotions with. Please feel free to reach out to me if you’re one of those people & definitely keep following our journey. #embraceyourself #lovelife #mentalhealthawarenessweek #donthideyourdifferences #thisgirlcan #showus #metoo #aeriereal

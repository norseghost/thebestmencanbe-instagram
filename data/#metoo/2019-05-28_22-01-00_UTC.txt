Kanye West Defends Trump Supporters For Standing Up For Their Beliefs–“Liberals Bully People Who Are Trump Supporters
Kanye West is not one to shy away from what he believes in, and it doesn’t look like he’s going to start anytime soon!
Kanye sat down with #DavidLetterman on his Netflix series, and discussed his views on everything from fashion, to music, to President Trump! According to @foxnews, Kanye brought up his relationship with Donnie in the midst of a conversation about the #MeToo movement.
“This is like my thing with Trump–we don’t have to feel the same way, but we have the right to feel what we feel,” he said.
Ye went on to explain that his decision to wear a MAGA had is not about politics, but he wants to convey the message that people should not be afraid to show their support for the president.
“So if I see a person that I admire talking about Donald Trump can think whatever he does,” Letterman said. “I wonder if those thoughts, indirectly, aren’t hurting people who are already being hurt.”
Previously, Kanye had vowed to take a step back from politics, but he made it a point to let Letterman know that Trump supporters have the same rights as everybody else.
“Have you ever been beat up in high school for wearing the wrong hat?” Kanye asked. “Liberals bully people who are Trump supporters!” he said.
Kanye also made is very clear that he has never and will never vote in any elections.
“I’ve never voted in my life,” he said.
Looks like Kanye is going to stand his ground on this one.

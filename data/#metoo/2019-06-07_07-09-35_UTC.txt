The story behind this slogan is: Back in 2018 a woman on radio @bbc5live phone in said Trump is a misogynist she was immediately described as ‚Äòhysterical‚Äô by another woman caller! Which in itself is sexist. It struck me that must make me hysterical, as I agreed with the first woman. So I posted about the story on here. The reaction from the gorgeous @thestlouisreviews suggested a slogan tee! Which has led me to the collaboration with Anthropologie. üåà‚ú®‚ö°Ô∏è Photo by @tam_tam_w

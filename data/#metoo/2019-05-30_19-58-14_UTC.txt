Girls need girlfriends. We need each other. We can't do any of this alone. It helps to know we aren't alone. Idk about you, but without the encouragement and prayers of a couple close girlfriends of mine, I could be hiding in a corner somewhere.
.
When you feel like you can't go on another day, call a girlfriend.
.
When you can't pray, call a girlfriend.
.
When you feel alone, call a girlfriend.
.
When you're down and need someone to help you up, call a girlfriend.
.
When your girlfriend is down, pick her back up.

Tag a girlfriend of yours that you can always count on!

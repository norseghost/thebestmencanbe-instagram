It’s Memorial Day, and we want to honor those who laid down their lives for our nation’s ability to march forward: into a future of more freedoms, more possibilities, and more hope. This MASSIVE victory from Nevada is just that, and a testament to what happens when we VOTE—when we treat our local and state elections as important as our national ones, we see huge, paradigm-shifting change from the ground up. ✊🏽✊✊🏻✊🏿

Since Nevada seated the nation’s first majority-female state legislature in January, the male old guard has been shaken up by the perspectives of female lawmakers. Bills prioritizing women’s health and safety have soared to the top of the agenda. Mounting reports of sexual harassment have led one male lawmaker to resign. And policy debates long dominated by men, including prison reform and gun safety, are yielding to female voices. No other legislature has achieved that milestone in U.S. history. Only Colorado comes close, with women constituting 47 percent of its legislators. In Congress, just one in four lawmakers is a woman. The female majority is having a huge effect: More than 17 pending bills deal with sexual assault, sex trafficking and sexual misconduct, with some measures aimed at making it easier to prosecute offenders. Bills to ban child marriage and examine the causes of maternal mortality are also on the docket. Go to washingtonpost.com to read more. (Photo by @melinamara/The Washington Post)

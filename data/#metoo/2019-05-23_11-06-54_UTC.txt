So I’m sitting here in the sunshine with my latte completing an interview for @thelaunchgals blog and it kinda got me thinking.

Have you thought about what legacy you want to leave on the world? What impact you want to make?

I realised when answering this question that if I could be known for anything, I’d want it to be for equipping women with the tools to confidently use their voice, be assertive and fight for what they believe in, whether that be on a small daily scale or a larger world wide scale.

Issues like the abortion laws in the US that have recently been a hot topic make me so damn angry... we watch shows like The Handmaids Tale and think, oh that could never happen... but there still seems to be people in this world who think it should happen. 
Who think women should have no say in regards to their choices and what happens with their body.

Fuck that.

We must stand up, be assertive and use our power.

Make your voice count. Stand up for what you believe in. Don’t let anyone tell you what you can and can’t do with your body, or let anyone make you feel shame about your body or what you choose to do with it.

What legacy do you want to leave?

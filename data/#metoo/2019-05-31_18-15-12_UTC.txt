Fun fact Friday!!! The best investment we have made for our health and wellness was this amazing box of plant power. It’s so awesome to see how taking out toxins from our home has changed our health. Our home was full of candles, plug-ins and tons of cleaning products. It was no wonder why I always had headaches, fatigue, respiratory issues, and the list goes on. Once I removed all those things little by little, I started to see all those symptoms diminish. I had no idea that it was all the chemicals in our home causing all these things. With all that being said I was able to replace candles with diffusers and chemical cleaners with only one plant based cleaner (that seriously cleans everything). I have been using plant based products for 2 years now and it’s just amazing. I have seen so many families blessed by them as well and it’s incredible. This journey has been a gift and a gift that keeps on giving. Join us on this wonderful journey. We are here to help every step of the way. .

Thank you Recovery Campus Magazine for the featured article on @wewpb the non-profit I am the Founder of. I used the pain of loosing my life-long best friend to an accidental overdose to fuel this endeavor. Kim struggled to find things to look forward to in early recovery, had a difficult time obtaining and securing employment and lost some of her dreams due to her addiction. The thought process was to help other women in Kim’s name, to give them an opportunity that she was not afforded

A powerful group of women and I followed our passion and hearts and created something beautiful. 
Today the organization offers a mentoring program to women in personal recovery, even if they aren’t awarded the scholarship

I love Barcelona, but this week I had a sad realization that almost every time I come here I get physically or sexually assaulted. From one of the first times I visited and a group of teenage boys grabbed my ass in broad daylight on Plaça de Catalunya (remember @beckycatx?) to receiving unsolicited, aggressive advances from men at clubs (kissing, more grabbing, etc...) when I’m just trying to mind my own business and dance. But the straw that broke my back this trip was walking through the park yesterday, minding my business only to turn back to an 80+ year old man, following - make that chasing - me in his electric wheelchair, cat calling and whistling to get my attention. Was it funny in the moment? Kind of. Rather, it was a representation of the lack of respect and boundaries men have for women’s bodies and personal space. Like grandpa wtf you think is going to happen? You wanna take me for a drink?! Literally never. When women can’t count on the safety of their own bodies in public, it instills fear and ultimately discourages us from going out in public at all. It’s a form of oppression, systematic patriarchy in action. You think this is a coincidence? Huh. And my experiences scratch the surface of what millions of women go through in a much more violent way. I’m sorry I have to even type this out but please DON’T TOUCH US TALK TO US OR EVEN LOOK AT US unless we send for you! And trust me, you’ll know! #metoo

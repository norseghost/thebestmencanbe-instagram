So the CDC once again dropping the ball on things like vaccination deaths, communicable diseases and now...male victims of rapeðŸ¤¬. Wow, just wow...Another year of ignoring findings and victims of rape.  Yes, it is possible for women to rape men.  Personally,  I  know just as many males that have gotten raped as females.  Some of the perpetrators were men and some were *gasp* women.  Women can be highly aggressive when it comes to sex, don't just blame men.  Men more likely, due to embarrassment (thanks to social stigmatizationðŸ˜‘) are far less likely to report rapes or even talk about them.  The statistics of this deplorable crime are much higher, I'm sure.  Women not coming forward for years, men alot of times not coming forward at all and suffering  in silence.  A friend may hear it over a beer, some pot or whatever when it accidentally slips out, but other then that?  I've had friends that were SRA (Satanic Ritual Abuse) survivors and it gets baaaaad.  Real badðŸ˜” As a country, if we are going to talk about equality, let's not forget our brothers in this struggle.  They cry out in pain too... #rape #metoo #malevictims #sexualassault #cdccoverups

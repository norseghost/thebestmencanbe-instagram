Some of you might think this post is unnecessary but I do not intend to be someone who accepts any kind of harassment, trolling or name calling. I get plenty of messages from lots of people, but when something is uncalled for and obnoxious, I cant let the person get away with it. 
This guy in question, was someone who followed me on instagram, I don’t know his name or where he’s from, he sent a few polite compliments to which I replied with a thank you. For months he kept sending me random messages, which I didn’t respond to because it didn’t feel necessary. Today he sent me a video, I wouldn’t want to post because it’s extremely sexual and disturbing. I asked him not to send me inappropriate messages, I mentioned I didn’t give him consent and he laughed it off, telling me I must look very pretty when angry. I had, had enough of this guy and decided to expose him on my insta stories to which he responded. Of course there was the usual “you are mental, go see a doctor, you are overreacting and stupid”. How many times have women heard these comments?! This name calling has gotten a bit old, and it’s not about to keep me from standing up for myself. This obnoxious, creepy, sexist behavior has been tolerated for a long long time, and now the Time is Up. 
All I wanna ask all you beautiful amazing ladies out there, is to speak up when something like this happens to you. Speak up because it’s important that men who do disrespect women, know what’s coming for them, if they continue behaving inappropriately. Speak up ladies, because you might inspire other women to stand up against their perps, stalkers, abusers. It’s okay to voice your opinion, because you didn’t ask for this, you didn’t approve of this and you’re not a victim! It takes courage to speak up! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

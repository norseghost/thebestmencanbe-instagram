We have all seen massive waves on social media on topics like female equality, self love and the #metoo campaign. Women want to be heard and be independent and officious. When you think deeper, you will see that clothing has a way in shaping identity and making a statement. So what trends should you be following? .
Spend time coordinating the bold colours and patterns in a way that shows you ‘have it all together’. So rather than settling with a full-on grey or navy suit, add a single bold colour to your shirt, handbag, or shoes.
.
Go for warm styles that sit comfortably high on the neck. Roll-neck jumpers are perfect for standing up to the chill while staying chic. .
Fluid fabrics are all the hype right now. These soft, quality polyesters are allowing working women to feel luxe and show off their figures better than stiff, starchy alternatives. Thick fabrics have less drape, and fluid materials have more. Choose clothing that feels light, and is easy to wear.

One of the most talked about works this year at @artbasel is Andrea Bowers’s Open Secret (2018) in the fair’s Unlimited section. Around 200 accounts of sexual harassment and statements from the accused can be read from the comfort of office chairs- a reference to the workplace being a common location for sexual harassment. #metoo #andreabowers #artbasel #artbasel2019 #artbaselunlimited

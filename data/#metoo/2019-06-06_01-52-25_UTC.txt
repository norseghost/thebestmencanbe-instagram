Here In LA!!! The EVERY WOMAN BIENNIAL is the all woman and women-identified art biennial founded and curated by C. Finley. What began as the Whitney Houston Biennial, a wild one-night event of art and performance celebrating women in 2014, and expanded to a two-week exhibition in 2017 in the awakening of the #MeToo movement, will present its third iteration, titled Every Woman Biennial, from May 20 - May 29 in NY, and a sister biennial featuring LA-based artists June 2 - 12 in LA!! 👏🏿👏🏽👏 The Biennial has grown in scope to include over 600 artists in its two unique presentations in NY and LA, featuring expanded art exhibitions, a NY film festival, and events including I WANNA DANCE WITH SOMEBODY Flash Mob in NY, and performances of Girl Bands in LA. Timing with The Whitney Museum’s Biennial, the aim is to extend the celebration of art and create even more positive opportunities for emerging women artists. The Biennial engages artists, through a democratic open call, to cross-pollinate with each other from a variety of mediums, generations, and racial and ethnic backgrounds. The salon-style exhibition features painting, photography, installation, sculpture, video art, textile, and multimedia works, activated by per- formance, dance, music, poetry readings, theater and film #everywomenbiennial #inspired #visionarywomen #womenempoweringwomen @nytimes @laweekly

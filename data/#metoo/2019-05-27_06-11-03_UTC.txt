Domestic violence is the domestic terrorism killing on average 1 woman a week by a current or former partner. 20 women have already been killed this year. Women lives should matter. We need our government to treat this as the national emergency that it is. How many more women need to die? How many children need to lose their mothers? How many daughters need to be lost? How many sisters need to be lost? How many families need to be left grieving? If you want to know what you can do as a individual, organisation, business, sports club, school etc to prevent violence against women then visit the Our Watch website.

#HerNameIs Courtney Herron. #HerNameIs Natalina Angkok. #HerNameIs Aya Maasarwe. #HerNameIs Eurydice Dixon. These are the names and faces of the  four women who have been murdered in Melbourne in the last twelve months. What killed them? “Men’s behaviour,” says Victoria’s Assistant Police Commissioner Luke Cornelius. “Violence against women is absolutely about men’s behaviour; this isn’t about women’s behaviour.” Link in bio for more on why this admission from the police is a step in the right direction.

Maraming Salamat to all the support we’ve received in communities around the world. 🗡♥️🗡 As we work to protect womxn & children from violence and sexual assault all over the world, we educate, decolonize, unsettle, and create sisterhood wherever we are called. Much love and light to all our warrior families. Please help share our work, especially on #YouTube where we are reclaiming the narrative of #PekitiTirsiaKali. Not surprisingly, 95% of our viewership on YouTube is male, reflecting how dominated the fighting arts stand today. Though there are many unauthorized PTK groups and fake associations, Survival Arts represents the real family and the values of our philosophy, establishing the first all-womxn’s Kali training groups internationally. Subscribe and share with your mothers, daughters, sisters, and loved ones. Let’s see if we can change the stats fam. 🗡☝🏽✨ #linkinbio .

                        "text": "#firstblacknaturethot truths is my mom may be livid when she sees this but I think she\u2019ll understand. .\n.\nSomething that has been incredibly hard on my emotional and mental health that I haven\u2019t been acknowledging, is that I\u2019m not graduating next week. I should be, technically. But I\u2019m not. The last four years has been a wild ride for me, meeting some of the lowest points of my life. I was sexually assaulted twice, in ways I can never forget. And because of that, I struggled, a lot. Watching everyone around me graduating I\u2019ve been feeling incredibly ashamed, guilty, inadequate, and a whole range of negative emotions. .\n.\n.\nI\u2019ve also been viewing my body in a negative way that\u2019s haunted me, and that I struggle to break free from most times I look in the mirror. Being outside, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s been showing me more than I realize. Like how incredibly strong my body is; my legs can happily carry me for my miles. How agile it is, as I notice how I zip over rocks and fallen logs and under branches. How healthy it is, even though people make fun of how I chug water, I\u2019m fueling myself right finally.  Today, a huge thing happened for me, I felt entirely in control of my body image, of the view in which I placed myself. .\n.\n.\nI wanted to take pictures of myself happy, strong, fit, anxious at my body being exposed, but learning that I am, and forever will be 1000x more than the things that have happened. I wanted my hair down too, my face free of anything (except my eyelash extensions LOL), my hands missing of acrylics, and I wanted to see how big my smile was glowing as I felt naturally and unapologetically myself in a place that will never put me in a box. And today, I did. But I also just like taking my clothes off, and guess what? I can do whatever the hell want. .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pnwonderland #upperleftusa #pnw #mtbaker #stevenspass #leavenworth #hiking #girlswhohike #seattle #washingtonstate #Evergreenstate #metoo"

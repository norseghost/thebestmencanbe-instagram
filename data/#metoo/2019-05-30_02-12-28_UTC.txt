We went to high school together. Sang and danced on a stage. We wrote about carbs in each others’ yearbooks. (((We’re still figuring that one out 😂))) She’s still dancing and I’m singing ABC’s in the classroom. Exercise was never a part of our friendship and truthfully that’s not what brought us back together. It was the simple fact that we shared a common bond in the thick of young motherhood. We were tired, stressed out, busy mommas who just wanted to feel better and give our best to our little tribe. Isn’t there something so special when you connect with someone and they say, “me too?” That’s what coaching has given me. A place to be surrounded by women who inspire me to grow into my best. Then the opportunity to share my story out loud. It wasn’t in my plan, but I can’t even begin to explain the massive ripple effect it has brought about. 🤸🏻‍♀️I speak for both Laura and I that every crevice of our days has been impacted beautifully by this journey. So, if you are in need of a buddy in this healthy thing you’ve got going on or maybe you need a butt kicker to get ya going >🙋🏻‍♀️< I got you ❣️

The #MeToo and #TimesUp movements have brought increased awareness of the pervasiveness and serious harm that sexual harassment and assault cause to victims. Calls for real change in our communities and businesses are overdue and welcome. 
First, learning respect for women starts at home, when boys watch how their mothers, sisters, and other women are treated and talked about by men. So when men at home treat women like theyâ€™re equally worthy and valued as people with needs, feelings, intelligence, skills, and power, boys are much more likely to grow up to do the same.

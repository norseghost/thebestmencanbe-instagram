                        "text": "The last day I ever drank alcohol was my wedding day.... | PART I\n.\nMy relationship with alcohol first started in high school after the death of my brother. I went from being praised by my parents for being the only girl in the limo who didn\u2019t drink on the way to prom while the rest of my friends got in trouble\u2014to the girl who was sneaking out at night, getting black-out drunk and waking up in random yards and houses the next morning\u2014sometimes even being picked up by the cops. I was self-imploding. What\u2019s worse\u2014I pushed away my family and close friends and surrounded myself with people who supported my destructive behavior.\n.\nLooking back now, 15 years later, I know why I was so drawn to the alcohol. It was my medicine, my way of running from the pain and the void that was left in the wake of my brothers passing. It was how I numbed the sadness, the grief, the anger, the confusion, the loneliness, the resentment. But after awhile, that numbing of all the bad, turned into numbing all the good too. I soon felt like there wasn\u2019t much to live for, so I continued on with reckless abandonment.\n.\nI eventually was kicked out of my house at the end of my senior year, and sent off to live with my aunt before heading to college in NYC to play Division I lacrosse. When I arrived at school, I was immediately thrown back into the toxic environment that encouraged my addiction. I didn\u2019t even make it through my first semester before ending up in a hospital, where I flatlined from alcohol poisoning and a BAC of a .38.\n.\nI remember the embarrassment, the guilt, and the slew of vile names thrown at me by my coaches. I had disgraced our team. I remember the individual sessions I\u2019d have with my coach and the 1000s of yards of sprints she had me run as punishment. The throwing up, the tears, the ice packs seran-wrapped to my body after we\u2019d be done\u2014praying the coldness would numb the pain. And the disgust in her eyes.\n.\nBut the worst punishment was the team punishment, when the coaches would force me to sit in the bleachers and watch as my teammates ran suicide sprints for an hour...because of me. My teammates hated me. I hated me.\n.\nTo be continued..."

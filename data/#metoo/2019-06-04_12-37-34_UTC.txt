I believe that in order for women to be liberated from a majorly patriarchal society, we need to become each others hope and light. We need to uplift one another so that belief may be instilled in each and everyone of us, in that we are deserving of equal rights and treatment. We need to elevate societies understanding on the power and potential of 'the woman' so that boundless opportunities can be created for generations of young girls to come.⚡ This is my second collection for the year and since my girls are busy with exams I felt it crucial to support their studies by rounding up a few educational supplies to assist in fuelling their fire.🎓 I have been fortunate enough to get to know them on a personal level over the past year. These young ladies are loving, brave, resilient and they hype me up on my lowest days. They are full of charisma and endless potential.💕 I would like to thank each and every woman who has contributed towards the second 'Ladies Lending Love' initiative as well as my family. Thank you to @BRITTANYJADEHOSKING for assisting me in realising my little project, you're the best partner!💛
Forever spreading as much love and light as I can❤ (The girls' faces are blurred out for their own protection)

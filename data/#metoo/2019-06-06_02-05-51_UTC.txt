Who knew?! I feel like most of the time we don't really know how to heal. We avoid. We like distractions. Occasionally we say we need a rest but then we lay on the couch...maybe watch tv or enjoy some wine. This is not rest and its not healing. 
Avoidnce isn't healing. 
When you think back did anyone ever really teach you how to heal? 
They probably didnt. They probably didn't know themselves how to do it besides staying busy and distracted. 
We learn coping skills from our parents and peers....yet so many things we don't talk about because we are ashamed. 
Let's teach our kids how to heal not just how to act!

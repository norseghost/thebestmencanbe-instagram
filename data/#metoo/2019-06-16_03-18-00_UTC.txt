PTSD has physical symptoms as well as mental. Our society tends to talk a lot about the ways that post-traumatic stress disorder impacts mental health. But the illness has profound effects across people’s well-being ― including their physical health.

According to “The Body Keeps the Score,” a book on trauma by psychiatrist and trauma specialist Bessel Van Der Kolk, physical symptoms with no clear cause are pervasive in traumatised children and adults. Among other physical manifestations, “they can include chronic back and neck pain, fibromyalgia, migraines, digestive problems, spastic colon/irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue and some forms of asthma,” Van Der Kolk wrote. https://youwillbearwitness.com/2019/06/15/ptsd-includes-physical-symptoms-here-are-some-of-them/ #ptsd #peterfox #ptsdsurvivor #ptsdrecovery #ptsdawareness #emdr #erinfado #stopracism #stopbullying #stopchildabuse #trauma #therapydog #dissociativeidentitydisorder #cptsd #cptsdawareness #metoo

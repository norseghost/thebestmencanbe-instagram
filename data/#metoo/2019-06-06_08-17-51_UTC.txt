The ActionAid team says #STOPGBVatWork! We call on the Australian Government to support the adoption of an ILO Convention and Recommendation to end violence and harassment in the world of work, at the June 2019 International Labor Conference. Join us by posting your photo on instagram too, with the hashtag #AllWomenWork

So much of my life is dictated by what happened. “Because of what happened I don’t go there.” “Because of what happened I can’t talk to so and so.” “Because of what happened I can’t grocery shop alone” for assault survivors constant reminders that you are safe and supported are a necessity. Please share @becauseofwhathappened with anyone you think it may help. #becauseofwhathappened

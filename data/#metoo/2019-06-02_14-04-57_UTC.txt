These ladies will also be at the ila launch event on June 7th so make sure to grab your tickets 🙌🏼 Doors open at 6:30pm and we’re giving away a little something special for the first 50 guests through the door! 
ila is a social enterprise that aims to shed light on gender inequality and how it leads to gender-based violence. We do this by bringing together a community of young, socially-driven individuals, purposeful brands and sexual violence survivors to make a difference. Our ilaX events, inspired by TedX with a gender lens, are at the core of this interaction. But any great vision starts with 'The First Step', which just happens to be the theme of our launch.

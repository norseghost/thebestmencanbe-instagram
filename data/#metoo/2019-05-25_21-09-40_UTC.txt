Aerial yoga has changed how I work out. Having been trained in classical ballet, yoga was very different for me. 
My multiple sport type of injuries, which led to many surgeries, combined with #fibromyalgia made traditional yoga difficult, and returning to ballet nearly impossible. 
Aerial yoga gives me the freedom to explore so many workout options. 
If you have #chronicpain or are seeking to expand your workout oprions, aerial yoga could be for you. I am currently offering private sessions for #pain and #psychologicaltrauma, such as #ptsd . 
As a survivor of a great deal of both, which I now see as a gift, I am able to show others how to find #painrelief  and even help address #insomnia . I can also recommend other beautiful souls who teach around the world! #aerialyoga #aerialyogagoddess #aerial #yoga #fibrowarrior #hope #dontbescared #bethechange #rapesurvivor #metoo #loveyourself #metime #strongwomen #speakup #risingwingsaerialyoga #abs #workout #mybodyismytemple #beloved

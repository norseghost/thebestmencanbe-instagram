This large-scale painting was a custom piece designed especially for @sarahbaeumler and @trishjohnstondesign They called me and needed a huge piece for a special space in Sarah and Bryan‚Äôs home for their series on @hgtvcanada They also needed it in 2 weeks, so crazy but we got it done and shipped!! Now who isn‚Äôt loving their new series #islandofbryan !? I love how they feature the successes along with the struggles! I also admire how ambitious they are and how they put family first, it gives me hope for our growing family ‚ù§Ô∏è The resort @caerulamar is looking pretty amazing!! Be sure to check it out as well as the new series ü§ó

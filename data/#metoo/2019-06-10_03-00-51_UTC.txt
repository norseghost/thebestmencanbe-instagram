After visiting the villages of Oruka, seeing poverty for the first time, I canâ€™t explain what we were feeling when we all jumped back on the bus. Most of us had mixed emotions about what we saw. Tears streamed down my face and it wasnâ€™t just the heartache I was feeling for those children that were so young and helpless but just how lucky I am to have the life I live. We drove 10min down the windy dirt path through 7ft grass and arrived at this celebration. Communities from far and wide come to meet us. Right at that moment, all the money and time it took the past few months of fundraising was clear. It was going to the people of Oruka and funding them for the next 8 years. I couldnâ€™t be more happier to be apart of it. Clearly ðŸ¤­ #metoo #thehungerprojectau

Freedom to Roam
The path we walk is for the few,
to wander free and find our truth.
The lives we live they split in two,
one half in pain the other truth.
We all get lost searching for a home,
a place beyond the ways we’ve known.
It just takes courage and a brave old soul,
not looking to find just freedom to roam.

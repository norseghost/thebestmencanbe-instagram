18 || Wow.  I wrote this song after the beginning of my #metoo story and the end of my first relationship.  As I performed it here at a naive 18 years old helping lead a youth retreat for my church, I had no idea I was entering what was perhaps an even more troubling season of “love.” When I stumbled upon this video today, it truly struck me how different my perspective is now.  I remember feeling so scared and still somehow so trapped sitting there singing this song of hope.  I knew God could protect me and the young people in this room from the kind of pain that had twisted the past few months of my life, and I wrote this song as a proclamation of that belief to share with this amazing group.  When I sang this song, I knew God had changed my heart, but I was waiting for Him to change my life.  I can definitely say that at a mere 21 years old, only three years after this video was taken...the journey has been insane, but *wow* has He provided.  I know I’m CHANGED.  God is GOOD. “I turn from my past in Your Presence // and I find myself on my knees. // And I bury the hurt I had harbored // O Lord, You set me free.” ❤️

Pretty Ugly #rings are #inspired by the fact that many of us are #marginalised by the societies we live in.
Each one bears taglines of feelings that #manifest within each one of us at times of #crisis #victimisation #fear #solidarity and #discrimination Full descriptions can be found on the product page for each ring, and full ethos on the "About Us" page.
Find which one resonates with you and wear it with #pride and know that you are not alone.
They are made in #sterlingsilver and will bear the marks of your life and how you choose to wear it. #embrace the marks, for true beauty lies in the #imperfections

I've been back in Belize for almost one week, after spending a month in Dallas, spending time with family, connecting with friends, and growing @mpulsestudio and the @love_necklace_campaign . Dallas life is a high energy whirlwind which I love, but that speed isn't conducive to tapping into creative vision/studio time... But here in San Pedro, this is where it slows down... this is where I can clear my mind, connect to a higher vibration, and create with my whole heart❤️🌴☀️#caribbean #artist #island #love .

My Dark Vanessa is, and probably will be, the best book I will read this year.

It's about a 50 yr old teacher that grooms his 15 yr old student. It's incredibly written and I could sit and debate about it non stop. So many layers. .

It's out 2020 and I genuinely believe this is a story for everyone. P.S This is just a sampler. Will take a pic of the proof soon

                        "text": "I witnessed a new, poignant dimension to this whole #metoo issue today at #TaiChi. My lovely teacher, Claire, was basically sexually harassed by an older student in front of all of us, a man who then for a final insult, said \u201cI\u2019m off, sweetheart\u201d before walking out of the class a half hour early, having arrived a half hour late. She laughed off his handsiness in her lovely French accent with a seamless #deescalation comment: \u201che\u2019s checking out the merchandise\u201d. About his breezing in and out on his own schedule, she said only \u201cyou\u2019re really taking the mickey.\u201d A comment which she berated herself for afterwards as having been too harsh. \nTOO HARSH, MY PEOPLE.\n\nI could not concentrate on my form after that. I was fuming. After class, I asked her if I could have her permission to say something next time he disrespected her like that. When I did karate, if you disrespected the Sensei you got bliksemed. And you KNOW Claire could bliksem this guy. She\u2019s basically a human boomslang.\n\nWell. The reaction of the teacher and the handful of (female) students who were still there surprised me. John had a stroke five years ago, shame, they said. (Sidebar, lets call him John.) We must help him get his confidence back. Isn\u2019t it humbling but also sad that this mixed bag of dames of various ages all had the same instinct... that if objectifying and belittling us can help this poor guy feel like a man, he should have at it? Bless their giving hearts. #Woman is mother even to her stupid-ass oppressor. But if we don\u2019t help an old dog learn new tricks - even a dog who is down and out - aren\u2019t we part of the problem? At least I did get Claire to reluctantly agree that next time she\u2019ll  say \u201chey, it\u2019s not sweetheart, it\u2019s SIFU to you, thank you.\u201d #girlpower #mommylion #mamabear #sifu #respect #warriorwoman #knowbetterdobetter #dontcallmebaby #idontcareifyouhadastroke"

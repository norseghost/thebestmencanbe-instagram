Award winning @VAULTFestival sell out show - 
My Father The Tantric Masseur by @romeister8 
Roann McCloskey navigates life as a post #MeToo Queer, British-Algerian woman in this award-winning sellout production that will have you laughing, crying and pondering the name you’ve given your genitals as she takes you on a journey of excruciating self-discovery. “Ask her to read a train timetable and she could have her audience in stitches.” – British Theatre Guide

Winner of Vault Origins Award for Outstanding New Work

Hello social media. I hope everyone is having a great week and are continuing to work hard toward their goals. .
Tomorrow will never come unless you start today!
.
Yesterday I had the pleasure of hearing @terrycrews and his wife speak on their life. .
They discussed personal hurdles in their past as well as sexual harassment and sexual assault in today's society. .
It was amazing to hear his story, he too has experienced sexual harassment.
.
I don't want to give away too much of his discussion before anyone gets the chance to see him. So im gonna cut it off there.
.
If you get the chance to hear him speak, I highly recommend that you go.
.
Im still a little star struck. He was very humble, down to earth, and I got to shake his hand.
.
We all started as something else. It's where we end it, and how we got there that truly matters.
.
Have a great week, stay hungry, and keep grinding.

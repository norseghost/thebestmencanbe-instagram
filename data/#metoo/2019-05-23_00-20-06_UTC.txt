During the #metoomovement, celebrities specifically in the film industry were exposed for sexual abuse or harassment. And there have been plenty of individuals in the film industry alone that are under allegations of pedophilia. Celebrities that included the famous director #BryanSinger, were under allegations of having sex with underage boys. Singer is responsible for popular movies such as, “Bohemian Rhapsody”, X-Men”, “The Usual Suspects”, and so much more. Because of Singer’s reputation in the entertainment industry, the accusations of him being a sexual predator was brushed off by the media and not taken seriously. Although the director’s victims have made statements of describing the attack in full detail, Singer has denied all allegations and claims the incident never happened. Many celebrities such as #HarveyWeinstein and #KevinSpacey, were exposed for sexual assault and have been blacklisted in Hollywood. Due to the allegations on Singer in 2017 that were made about an incident that occurred in 2003, Singer was fired from the film, “Bohemian Rhapsody” a few weeks before the film was completed. But although Singer was fired, he still has many projects lined up. There are plenty of individuals in the entertainment industry who are still getting away with sexually abusing children and are being protected by those in high power.

I am really late to the party with this one but I’ve finally got around to reading Naomi Alderman’s The Power (currently about half way through). As a researcher of women’s SF in the late 19th and early 20th century it’s interesting to see how this book connects to its forebears but in many ways it is exactly of its time. This is a story written for and about the #metoo generation, though it should be read by everyone.

Jayda Dominique Marley is an 18 year old Queer Femme Afro-Indigenous spoken word poet based in Tkaronto. She was raised in the Jane and Finch community where she acts as the Youth Ambassador for “Develop Me Youth” a platform for young Activists of Colour who want to make change in their neighbourhood and fight against mental health stigma. She has been writing and performing spoken word poetry since the age of 13. Jayda officially started her artist journey at Louder Than A Bomb Toronto 2018 where she scored a perfect 30 her first ever time competing. She shares her experiences with finding herself as an Indiqueer woman, homophobia, rape culture, addiction and growing up as a young biracial woman in Tkaronto. In 2015, She was awarded the Black Student Recognition Award after performing one of her earliest slam poems, “They Underestimate.” With the West End team Jayda has earned the “Voices of Today 2018” national championship. Her poetry has also been published in different anthologies, including the nationally distributed “West Enders” magazine and “In this Together.” Whether you catch Jayda at an open mic around the city, or on bigger platforms like Nuit Blanche and Parliament Hill, Jayda is sure to captivate every crowd she touches with her words and is never afraid to speak on the injustices around her. Jayda spreads love and inspiration everywhere she goes & when she isn’t feeding into her performance addiction, she is waist deep in a book or teaching youth across Turtle Island how to use their voices using spoken word & rap.

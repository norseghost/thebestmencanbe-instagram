What a fabulous day out to run, get out there!!! Got 5 miles in today with some friends and new friends! We ran the lighthouse route from last weekend for a makeup but ran it the other direction! We started at the lighthouse instead of running to the lighthouse! We did 5 miles, then I did my 10 hill sprints afterwards! Then we made our way to the gym where they have an amazing hot tub/sauna/steam room relaxation facility where I got in and stretched and relaxed and then took a “pretend you’re at the beach trying to be sexy under the waterfall” photo shoot because I’m hilarious. 😂🤷🏻‍♀️ then I had some cross training pumping my flat tire up with a bike pump... quite the adventurous morning. 😂😂😂

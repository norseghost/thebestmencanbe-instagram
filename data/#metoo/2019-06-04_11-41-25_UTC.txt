I love getting these letters from #thebritishlibrary - it means another author is born! 
This excellent book from @clairegrayauthor tells the story of her sexual abuse at the hands of her employer when she was modeling. She allows her vulnerability to teach other aspiring models what to look out for so that shocking behaviouris stopped. This is a really eye-opening account of what sexual predators will do to get what they want. Please do follow her account for info on how to get the book, or DM if you want further info. 
So important this message is learnt and shared!

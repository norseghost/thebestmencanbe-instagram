There is a sad irony in the fact that this year's commencement speaker will be Tarana Burke, the founder of the #MeToo movement, at a time when Brooklyn College is rife with complacency when it comes to sexual violence; whether it is their refusal to take adequate disciplinary measures against rape condoning professors like Mitchell Langbert, or continuing to maintain a business relationship with the Residence Hall, from which many students have come forward to share their experiences of sexual harrassment and a sense of powerlessness because Title IX policies do not apply there.

@taranajaneen we're grateful to have you speak at the @bklyncollege411
graduation commencement, but we just thought you should know this.

Proud to announce that my documentary thesis “You Found A Home” was chosen as a ‘faculty select’ at the Brooklyn College Film Festival on May 28th at BAM Rose Cinema. I will always treasure the work we did in speaking truth to power, and bringing positive change to Brooklyn College.

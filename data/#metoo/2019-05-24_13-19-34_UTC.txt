I was in love with a fool
towards the stars
He held his gaze 
flower in hand
a little dog behind him
is trying to pull him back
On his shepherd's stick, the fool 
he carries a bag
full of his beliefs
rocks from the past. .
.

I was a complete fool
.
I kept on going despite the signs
despite the cliff 
Ready to leap 
I felt that I could fly
.
And then behold
This fool of mine
He stood right at the edge
The little dog -behind his back
He took a real big bite 
And in a shock the fool looked down
The dog turned into a ghost
In fear and pain
Now looking down 
the cliff
the fall
No stars .
.
.

Healing happening in metaphors and magic all around. Transforming pain and wounds into beautiful paintings and poems and blood from my heart. Forever grateful and ever more in love with my broken heart. Golden light coming in through its cracks. No fool can take me down. .

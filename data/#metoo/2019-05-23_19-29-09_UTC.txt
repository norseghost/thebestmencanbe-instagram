I've missed my daughters first words, first steps, first Christmas. And her second birthday, her second Christmas too. Not even a phone call I have been allowed to have. 
How can someone be so cruel in order to hide their missdoings with lies... And worse...how can a system allow this altogether and then use the fact that you have been separated from your kids aleatory and for evil reasons, to not let you have your kids ever again?

Welcome to the life of many fathers and some mothers too and welcome to the world of parental alienation which Sweden and many other countries dont even acknowledge still these days.

And what's even sicker, welcome to the process recommended by many lawyers to get custody of kids. 
You have no idea how sick this world is.

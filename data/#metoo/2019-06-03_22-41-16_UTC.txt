“We are the Supermajority!” Like many women, I have been frustrated with the politics in this country. My family and I have voted, marched, written postcards and letters, signed petitions, and donated time and money. I feel like we are still slipping backwards. Some days I get overwhelmed and depressed, but this morning, thanks to @heidi4herstory and the advisors of #supermajority Ai-Jen Poo, Alicia Garza and Cecile Richards I am feeling inspired and hopeful. Supermajority’s goal is to ensure women’s voices are heard and a women’s agenda is represented in policy debates, in legislative fights, and at the ballot box in 2020 and beyond. We need to change the political dynamic in this country, help women to become politically powerful and make issues that are important to us a top priority. Thank you ladies for leading the charge and also to the many amazing women who were there today from local organizations such as #womeninfilm #metoo #timesup and #lawomenscollective “This world crisis came about without women having anything to do with it. If the women of the world had not been excluded from world affairs, things today might have been different.” — Alice Paul, Suffragist, Feminist, Activist 1886–1977.

‘.. Adam had a first wife, before his marriage to Eve, the demonic Lilith’ my sweet husband (thank you sweet husband) is photographing some decades old work, painted when I was a very angry, very young heathen feminist. I’m still a heathen feminist, not young, and the anger isn’t turned as much inward. This work was a part of a series painted from ‘93 - ‘96 called A Short History of Misunderstood Women. They, without sounding too melodramatic, saved - if not my life - then my sanity during a seriously fucked up and volatile time. Amazing how our inner demons protect us, in retrospect from the very real and very deadly. Long may she conjure before her fire. #painting #metoo #womanpainter #expressionism #expressionist #feminist #feminism #trauma #traumarecovery #acrylic #lilith #demon #occult #recovery #macabre #alchemy #oldgods #goddess

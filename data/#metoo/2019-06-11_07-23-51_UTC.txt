i wish i knew how to talk to people about this. like it’s not like i don’t trust them because i do. and i want to talk about it. and it would help so much. but i can’t bring myself to do it. thinking about it is already so painful and actually speaking everything with words sounds terrible. this account has definitely helped me to feel more comfortable with everything that happened but i’m still so scared to actually say it out loud and admit it. i don’t know why that scares me so much

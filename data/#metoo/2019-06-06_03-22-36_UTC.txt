Becoming aware of the unknown can be bitter sweet.  After a lifetime of wondering who my biological father was I have finally come to the end of the search. I received this photo of him yesterday and I have to admit I’m a bit torn.  I’m happy to have actually followed though on my quest but saddened to find out he passed away in 2004 never knowing he was a father.  He never had any children so my closet of relatives are aunts/uncles (mothers side)and cousins.  Not that it’s terrible but had always hoped to have half siblings since my sister was killed when I was ten and raised as an only child. But this could be some of the meat of the possibility of a new book? #solaceinchaos #truth #bittersweet #endofthechapter #makethebestofnow #nowiknow #sad #spain #paris #london #canada #metoo #losangeles #newyork #phoenixarizona @hbo @strandbookstore @outlier_stories @lifetimemovies @nytbooks @netflixfilm #book #author #solaceinchaosavailableatamazon

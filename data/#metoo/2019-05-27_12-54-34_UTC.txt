Made it through the surgery and on the mend ❤💕 already feeling like ive started reclaiming my body autonomy. 
Gonna be here in the hosp for another 4 days before heading home. Catheters are the worst but saves having to move around heaps while healing initially. 
18 months after the assault it feels good to be able to put the physical side behind me to a large extent. Onwards and upwards! 
The nurses have been amaze and keep sneaking me extra cookies cos #LittleLife #Littlespace #Little hehe.

A open form on Masculinity For The Modern Man & Workshop on Grooming

Hit link in bio for details and tickets 
We explore all things manly — from the serious and philosophical, to the practical and fun. We seek to uncover how to live with grandpa’s swagger, virtue, and know-how in the present day.
Regrooming Masculinity unleashes the power of the Barbershop to re-imagine men’s gender identities and foster their diversity. By challenging stereotypes about men and masculinity, we investigate how men construct their identities through appearance and how the Barbershop can be a vital tool to advance social change. This feminist-driven project creates a new approach to understand and transform how men see themselves, interact with each other, and engage with women. @helmboots @prorasousa @cassellshamburgers @hotelnormandie #maleconsulant #mindset #fatherhood #metoo #manstuff #brotherhood #masculinity #manhood #bespoke #mentoring #vulnerability #selflove #MenDoMakeADifference #ProtectHerSpace #therapy #barbershoptalk #masculine #vulnerability #commandments #vulnerability #gentlemansclub #realtalk #mentalhealth #bussinessman #sportman #thewealthybarber

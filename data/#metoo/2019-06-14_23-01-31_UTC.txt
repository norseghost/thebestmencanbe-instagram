A year ago today after an 8 hour work day, we filmed the #allileftunsaid trailer in my home. <Link in Bio> My real thoughts when I look at this video today: (1) Ha, I filmed my trailer after my book came out. {Most authors drop trailers prior to book release to help create book buzz and increase pre sales.} I knew this based on research but I like to do things my way 😁lol. (2) why did you choose that day to ask your sister to experiment with a wand on your hair? Oh yea bc I like to do things my way😁. (3) Am I a gambler 🤔? Hahaha give my trailer some love on YouTube 👍🏽 on its 1 year anniversary ❤️. Happy Friday friends ✌🏽 #authorlife #booktrailer #amwriting #writersofinstagram #writingcommunity #writingtips #author #fiction #novel #community #love #metoo #womensfiction #culture #immigration #family

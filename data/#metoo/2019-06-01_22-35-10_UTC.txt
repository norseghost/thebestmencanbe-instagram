Hi everyone! Just a little note from myself real quick:
â€”â€”â€”
Many of you know that I am a rising senior in high school. Over the past week, I have been on a road trip across the country to take tours of two different colleges. I got the chance to see @ucollegene in Nebraska, and Monday I will be exploring @andrews_university in Michigan. Throughout this escapade of sorts, I have learned some things...
â€”â€”â€”
ðŸŒ» College is gonna come SOON, and I donâ€™t have much time to prepare.
ðŸŒ» There will be many pros and cons to wherever I decide to go, theyâ€™re all important.
ðŸŒ» I have no clue how financial aid & scholarships work, but if Iâ€™m honest... Iâ€™m gonna need a lot of it.
ðŸŒ» College applications are long and confusing, and how the heck does early admission work???
â€”â€”â€”
Here at #createdinthechaos my goal is to help as many people as possible, starting online. So I have decided to start a series on the transition into senior year / college / life after highschool, and we can learn together!! ðŸŒ·

More information will be coming later so STAY TUNED!!

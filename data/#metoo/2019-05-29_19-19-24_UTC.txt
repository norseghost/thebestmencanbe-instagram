I recorded from @gyumstagram 
When i like something i will dig deep, even to the shitty parts. Because shits happen anywhere. That includes kpop.
I love YG kids, Monsta x, JYP boygroups, NCT, Mamamoo, and try to listen to many others. 
But i cannot act blind, that kpop industry projecting this cute innocent image to make us mad in love with them, and in the end buying their products. That's why when i watch shows like i can see your voice, i found that this industry would rather losing better talents than having not so pretty artists. 
That's why, kudos for Cube, regardless the management, this company have great vocalists. 
Also the mysoginistic behavior that i see on Korean program like hello counselor, honestly makes my blood boiled. 
BTW, what i am trying to say is, when image becomes comodity, utility and quality are not important anymore. People wearing masks afraid of losing materialistic things are everywhere. Why many celebs get depression? I think because they're not allowed to be themselves. It's a natural consequence because your mind is damn tired to act like someone else, and constantly tip toeing. 
Yeah... I hope everyone don't act blind towards something they love. Let your sense lead your heart so you won't be victim of things or people you love.  #dkdktv #myvoice #music #entertainment

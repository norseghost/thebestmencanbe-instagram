Not a post about art, or activism, just a thought about being connected online.
Specifically for young souls.

I’m a woman, but I’m not a teenager.
Four years ago I was hyper active on Twitter and Google+ as an animal rights activist.
Found a partner that backed me.
We started two other accounts together to blast away trying to save the world.
I trusted this guy implicitly.
Four years working together online.

But I learned later that he was a predator.
Clever, intelligent, devious and thought nothing of threatening physical violence.

My point?
Young ladies, please, please be careful online of whom you extend your trust to.

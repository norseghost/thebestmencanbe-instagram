There are times when there are just too many things to get angry about, and when youâ€™re simultaneously angry at all of them, it gets quite exhausting. What am I angry about? 
This god damn shaming culture which is at the root of literally everything. Shamed for being fat, shamed for being thin, shamed for dressing a certain way, shamed for being harassed, sexually assaulted, raped, shamed for being gay, trans, non-binary, bisexual, a woman, a POC, shamed for having an opinion, having an abortion, having a period, being a feminist, being a refugee, being sexually liberated, being body confident, being single, being a sex worker, being literally anything that doesnâ€™t conform to the binary world we live in. 
I know Iâ€™m definitely preaching to a crowd on here who probably agree with me, but can everyone P L E A S E chill the f*ck out and stop it with this shaming culture? Itâ€™s exhausting. ðŸ‘Ž â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €

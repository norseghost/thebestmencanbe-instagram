Everyday was and still is a struggle for me. I grew up believing abuse was just apart of a normal father daughter relationship. IT IS NOT. As hard as I try to be the most positive me, it can be hard and has been really lonely. There are still nights I drop to my knees crying, just wishing I could forget, wishing I could be a “normal” girl with a “normal” life. Wishing the only worry I had was about the outfit I was going to wear on my date. I wish I could openly trust people and not have to second guess what their real motive is. It’s been hard to function in everyday life, with rumors spreading rapidly about situations people don’t know about, with cruel texts and emails being sent that if you read you just couldn’t believe and the overall rep of “troubled” children from divorced family’s has been hard. I’d like to start speaking out and spreading the word #metoo . Please remember to be kind and loving to those around you, since leaving our situation 7 months ago I’ve had the opportunity to go to therapists, women shelters, abuse child services and the police and been able to meet and speak to many people. I have learned so much and been able to see that I am not completely alone and there are A LOT of people going through similar situations to mine, people all around me, people I have just met, people I have know for years and even friends of mine who just haven’t spoken out about it. No matter who you are and where you stand you can always be kind, I have learned what I huge difference just a kind word can do. I’d appreciate it if you share my story in hopes someone will see it and see that they are not alone. In hopes that someone will see it and make a change because so far the family courts have been sexist and think me and my little sister need both parents in our life. This may be true in many cases but not mine. #stopabuse #spreadtheword #metoo #narcissist

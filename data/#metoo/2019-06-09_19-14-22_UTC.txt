This is the most pivotal lesson I have ever learned. Because of the extended period of incest abuse in my childhood, I have had to reprogram myself to trust my own opinion and intuition as an adult woman. I couldnâ€™t trust my innate feelings as a child. 
Those feelings and intuitions were negated by those family members abusing me. I was taught by those family members that my intuition, my opinion of what was happening was wrong. As an adult I have looked to others for validation. I have held their opinion of me at a higher value than my own. I have stayed in relationships even if I no longer loved the person to simply gain their validation. It never happened and it never will. 
Today I hear my voice louder and stronger than any other opinion. It is a daily commitment but I am learning to trust myself as well as others. It is BEAUTIFUL ðŸ’›

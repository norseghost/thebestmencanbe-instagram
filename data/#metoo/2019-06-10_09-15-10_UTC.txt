I've been bullied since I was a kid. No one believed in me. My dreams and concerns dubbed as stupid and useless. I have never been helped by my family. To tell your child, my child you can do anything, you are strong, believe in it. I never knew that. It was the opposite. Whenever I trusted, it was trampled underfoot. Mental as well as physical abuse. Raped. Nobody wanted my love ... Until today. I do not have much positive to show. I am healthy and have a dog that I dedicate all my love to. I have my art in which I can lose myself. Am I someone who, despite all this, can be lucky? Maybe that's why? I dont know. Experiences make us grow and slowly I find my way back to happiness. There is a man who has rekindled my dreams and showed me that dreams are not meaningless. Because they can certainly come true. Thank you ❤️ @disvicious1
NOW I'M SAYING .... FUCK YOU FATE, I know you hate me but I WANT TO HAVE FUN IN MY LIFE

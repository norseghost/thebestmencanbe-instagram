I wrote this because cis-guys kept calling me darling and what is dejecting & infuriating is when you ask them not to, they keep doing it. The song has 4 sections and was a way of processing a weird mix of depressing dysphoria and intersectional feminist rage. When my friend (based in Hong Kong) told me she plays this on repeat when she’s at the gym, I thought I would re-share. I think the world needs more intersectional feminist music in many different styles!⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣

Squid & The Krakens were my first band (2013-2016). We performed this when we headlined Transpride, Brighton in 2016! A slightly different line-up (listed above) played on our 2nd EP " The Flying Coffee Machine" from which this track is taken. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

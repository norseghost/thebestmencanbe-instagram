excuse the lack of makeup posts, i'm having a rather off mental health day today but luckily i have my man who is helping me power through it! i was struggling this morning but days like this is part of recovery and i need to remind myself that i am in recovery and i'm not where i was 2 years ago. i am happy and i'm moving on with my life and growing and gaining more confidence everyday. i'm proud of myself and you should be proud of yourself too. i see so many of you putting yourself down, whether it be for not being able to make "instagram worthy" vegan salad bowls, or your makeup doesn't seem "worthy" enough for PR/likes etc, or even you just don't feel like you're not good enough in yourself. f""k instagram standards, post what you want, post a pot noodle sandwich if you want to, your makeup is unique and you're so talented, you're talent is growing with every post you make, everyone has to start somewhere. you're amazing, don't let other people or even yourself put you down, it's easier said than done but you can do this ðŸ§¡

She was different than the woman that boarded the flight to Utah to change her life. \u263a\ufe0f She had learned the past could no longer hurt her. She learned that she was so much stronger then she knew. She learned and finally understood it was not her fault. She was not the sum of the actions taken against her. She believed, for the first time, she was more than enough. She had been given the keys to freedom and it was her job to use those keys. \ud83d\udd11 \n@youniquefoundation you helped her save her life. You helped her figure out who she was meant to be before her abuse and then you gave her the tools to become her. \nShe knew she would leave The Haven Retreat a different person and that she did. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb I am her. I love her. I will protect her. I am grateful for her! \u2764\ufe0f#survivor #enough #metoo #supporther #standup #havenretreat #healing #bossbabe"

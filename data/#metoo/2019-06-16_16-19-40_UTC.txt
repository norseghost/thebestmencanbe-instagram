Finished this piece today. The color scheme is meant to portray that, with our disorder, the past has colored our bowtie to match. Everything that surrounds us touches us in a lasting way. We can so easily lose ourselves in being what others want because we can be whatever they want. We don't want to be that way anymore. We are shooting for authenticity in the future.  #dissociation #dissociativeidentitydisorder #multiplepersonalities #mentalhealthawareness #metoo #mentalillness #survivor #ptsdrecovery #ptsd #complexptsd #complexptsdrecovery #anxietyrelief #anxiety #acrylicpainting #painting #paintersofinstagram #painter #mixedmediacanvasart #depressionkills #majordepressivedisorder #suicidepreventionhotline #activerecovery #aliceinwonderland #redqueen #acquaintancerape #artsy #arts #arttherapylife

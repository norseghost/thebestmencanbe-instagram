Who else LOVED this epic monologue from the indomitable @kristinscottthomas in series 2 of @bbcfleabag - it totally summed up the feeling of post menopause for me!

It’s been nearly a week since the earth moved at the @megsmenopause conference but the feeling of collective female anarchy firmly remains.  Excitement is afoot - a step forward from #metoo with a mature vibe of experience & power. A movement pushing AGAINST the stereotyping of the batty middle-aged woman. 🤜🏻 🔥

For too long there has been a casual dismissal of the menopause, of ‘the change’. Even the terminology of the menopause is used with disregard. Take Ben Broadbent, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England referring to the economy being in a “menopausal” phase after passing its productive peak! What!! Of course he apologised, but it’s the general assumption that menopause signs the start of a woman’s decline! This shattering prejudice makes us feel worse in an already often terrifying emotional & physical upheaval. Yes the menopause is horrifying for many of us with the symptoms debilitating the most energetic and beaudacious amongst us. The jolting loneliness as we feel ourselves altering with often little understanding from the outside world. BUT what we want others to comprehend is this change can be positive. The other side of this entirely natural occurrence can be beautiful!! Suddenly we are free with a new lease of life and sense of adventure like never before. Children are often fleeing the nest at this time in our life and that whilst bringing up other emotions, also signals the start of a new chapter.

Our combined energy in the ‘MZ Trauma Shake Off’ at the MM Event last week was one of CELEBRATION; encapsulating the collective adulation for our new lives ahead. A life armed and charmed with wisdom, vision and energy for our adventures and anarchy ahead! 💃💃 💃  As one who’s come out the other side, I salute your journey and celebrate every woman going through the newly christened MEGAPAUSE and the wonders of making it magically and mindfully through to a new dawn!🔥🔥🔥 #menopause #menopauserebellion #fleabag #postmenopause #perimenopause #phoebewallerbridge #femaleempowerment

It’s Tuesday! So let’s Talk About It. #TalkAboutItTuesday

I am constantly inspired by those who find the strength to say #MeToo. Not only did MeToo start a national and global conversation that was necessary...it also drove many private conversations that were just as, if not more, important. No matter when, no matter where, no matter who...whether publicly or privately announced, MeToo gave a voice. If fortunate to be the next Miss Illinois, I will continue to help survivors find that voice and continue to be a voice for the voiceless. #AutumnAgainstAssault #MissIL19 #MAO #NOMORE1in4

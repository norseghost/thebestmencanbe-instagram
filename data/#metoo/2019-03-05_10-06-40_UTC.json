                        "text": "WORK SEXUAL HARASSMENT MYTHS\n\nAccording to the\u00a0Australian Human Rights Commission, in 2018, 23% of women & 16% of men have experienced sexual harassment at work in Australia.  Here are 8 common myths often used to justify sexually harassing behaviour:\n\n1: People who get offended just can\u2019t take a joke or are too sensitive. \n2. It\u2019s just boys being boy.\n3: You should take it as a compliment. (If unwelcome, it\u2019s not a compliment).\n4: They\u2019re one of our top performers... 5: It\u2019s all gone too far \u2013 we can\u2019t say or do anything these days!\u00a0\n6: I don\u2019t want to get involved \u2013 it\u2019s none of my business.\n7: It only happens to [straight-cis] women.\u00a0\n8: It\u2019s mainly just senior men taking advantage of their secretaries. \nSexual harassment in the workplace is about power.  It is disrespectful, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, cultural background, age etc.\n\nOn a personal note, I recall an incident of harassment when I was a young manager of about 28y old.  One of my older male colleagues ( who reported to me) grabbed me and popped me on his knee.  He then jiggled me up and down like a child, squuezing me & laughing at \"how scrumptious\" I looked \ud83d\ude24. Needless to say, I was outraged and set very firm boundaries.  He never touched me again, but it has stuck in my mind as a huge act of disrespect and attempted disempowerment. \nSource: www.dca.org.au/research/project/myth-busting-sexual-harassment-work\nPhoto:  This graffiti in a neighborhood in Cairo is emblazoned with the words \"no harassment\" in Arabic.\n\nJune Gay Psychologist @travelpsychology\n#psychologistchatswood #psychologydemystified #sexualharassment #harassment #sexism #stopbullying #bullyingawareness #bullying #bullyinghurts #discrimination #antidiscrimination #harass #workworkwork #work #employment #respectforall #harassing #diversity #diversitymatters #culturaldifferences #instaharassment #workplace #metoo #metoomovement #harassment"

Do I need to shout it louder for those of you at the back?

Last year I read "Why I'm no longer talking to white people about race" and since then I have started working through @laylafsaad "Me and my white supremacy workbook" which has made me feel so many different things. I know I still have a lot to learn and would welcome any other book reccomendations... Please comment below or DM me

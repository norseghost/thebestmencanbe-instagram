A little over two years back when I was in Pattaya, I visited the Pattaya Marriott. Unfortunately it doesn't exist today. I checked out this rooftop bar with a great view of the city. I really hope they put up a new Marriott property. In the meantime, I liked the vibe here, but the rooms felt small.

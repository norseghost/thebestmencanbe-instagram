For the fear you felt deep down, for the unexpected end to your beautiful hopes and dreams.

We are running for Anni
For your innocent and kind face, for your believe in love.

We are running for Jayde
For your gentle heart that trusted the enemy, for being oblivious about the trap being set.

We are running for Sinoxolo 
For no one knew of the invisible scars laid across your heart

We are running for Khensani
We cry because you were strong but not strong enough.

We are running for all women and beautiful children who have been senselessly killed in this country!

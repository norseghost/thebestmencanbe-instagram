Happy Pride!! We’re going to use this month to highlight the experience of LGBTQ+ victims of street harassment. We will be drawing attention to the higher rates of abuse that queer people face but also the different way in which this harassment takes place and above all its psychological and physical impacts. 
Follow @ourstreetsnow and sign the petition in our bio to make #streetharassment illegal in the UK

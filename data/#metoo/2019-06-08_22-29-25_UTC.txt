Radical Matriarchy banned from @facebook for 30 days for posting a video about @spencertunick and @ncacensorship action on @facebook and @instagram I wonder if @spencertunick and @ncacensorship will mention THIS #censorship on their social media...the censorship of a woman artist talking about the sexualization of women’s bodies 🧐🧐🧐⁣

 If you haven’t seen the controversial FEMINIST WEATHER REPORT yet  it’s the latest IGTV video and also there is a link in the bio to #youtube Highly recommend to watch on your TV cuz Women’s Rights look good on TV⁣

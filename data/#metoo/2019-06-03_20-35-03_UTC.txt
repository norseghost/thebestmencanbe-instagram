A small snippet of the unformed falling softening dance. It’s almost bearable to watch myself moving when I’m almost too small to see… I properly heard these lyrics for the first time on some of my recent driving. The flowers in my hair wouldn’t last two minutes but I’ll take the grace in my heart. Thank you Mumford and Sons for sweetening the falling: “There will come a time, you'll see, 
With no more tears,
And love will not break your heart, 
But dismiss your fears.
Get over your hill and see 
What you find there
With grace in your heart 
and flowers in your hair.” (In case anyone is wondering, this is unlikely to be the music that ends up in the piece, but it was nice to move to today.) #falling #somaticinvestigations #fightinglikeagirlandwhatittaughtme #theatrausirgar #ffwrnestheatre #crochan #dance #choreography #researchanddevelopment #martialarts #yoga #womenmartialartists #metoo #welshdance #artscouncilwales #cyngorcelfyddydaucymru #mumfordandsons

Set out for 4 miles and hill sprints today... my body had other plans. I got very itchy at the start of my run, assuming heat rash. But around 2 miles in I started having chest pains so I walked a little more then tried running and it just wasn’t going away. Came home and rested and drank lots of fluid and I’m feeling much better. Here’s to hoping Wednesday’s run goes better. Sometimes w just have off days or even weeks.

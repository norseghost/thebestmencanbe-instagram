I watched @letterman interview with @melindafrenchgates and it was worth every minute. When it comes to gender equality, the world still has a long way to go especially Africa. Melinda has a new book Moment of lift, which basically talks about empowering women, and the statistics in the books are unexpectedly true. I thought to share a few.

The first book I read about gender equality was Humanity Divided by UNDP and it exposed me to a lot I never saw about the topic. I'm going to have a daughter someday, and I think it's necessary for me to arm myself with adequate knowledge ahead of time.

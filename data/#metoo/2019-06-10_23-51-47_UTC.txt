Tw: sexual assault/rape

Here comes a vulnerable moment but I’m so fucking sick and tired of having to bite my tongue because it’s what society expects of afabs. 
I was molested when I was 6. I was raped at 17 and 19. I’ve been sexually assaulted at a couple jobs. My mom was raped. My sister was raped. My dad was sexually assaulted. Why is this shit still happening? Why are people supposed to stay quiet about it? If people want to tell their story, let them. Don’t silence them because it makes you uncomfortable or because it makes you feel guilty. We are survivors. We deserve to have our voices heard. Silence is violent. Let me people scream and shout their truths. Let people experience every emotion they need to in order to cope. Be kind. Care for people. And no matter the circumstance, NO MEANS NO!!! •

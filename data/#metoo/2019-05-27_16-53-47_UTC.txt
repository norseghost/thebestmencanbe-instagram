Breaking Gender Stereotypes — 🌸🥐🚎
Gender stereotypes have been engrained in the mindset of our society, influencing the thoughts of all genders. Men can wear makeup while women can play sports just as well as men. Have you ever had a fear of expressing yourself, not wanting to be judged by others? People may feel caged in or too afraid to break the status quo. There is so much stigma waiting to be cleared by the help of people willing to raise awareness. Collectively, we can paint the world with colours other than pink and blue. - nicole

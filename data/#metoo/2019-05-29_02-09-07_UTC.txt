Cześć!! Bb's most vulnerable lil project yet, "Trans Boy Remember," is premiering in the TelefonART portion of the #SzczecinFilmFestival this summer. Featuring music by @teachingrobotstolove & animation by @shoshanabgordon //////////
A censored synopsis: "At the age of 9, I stopped speaking. It's the year I broke from the inside. I came out as a trans boy years later. I am often afraid of becoming a man who I might confuse for the one who hounded my body. This film is a poem, this film is about growing into the unknown." // Featuring text from my past anthologies, "Written on the Body" and "Attention: People With Body Parts." /////// The evening will showcase best films made on mobile devices and non-professional equipment // 6-8pm on Sunday, June 16th at Technopark Pomerania in Szczecin, Poland. Poland & Germany & local pals, please consider taking a field trip ❣️ Special thanks to @sade.boy32_ @verycuteasparagus @buddhababy323 for your support in the making of this & @seandukeshannon for the encouragement to submit it. .

This scar, was my reaction to being sexually assaulted. 
On June 5th 2019 - Samuel D. Drinkert (my daughters uncle)  was found guilty by a jury, of not just the crime against me but also another sexual assault against a different woman. That makes 2 crimes he committed. 
He showed no remorse and fought it the whole way. He also turned down 2 plea deals.

He was dishonorably discharged from the Navy, plus 15 years incarceration. 
I used to call him my friend, he's my fiance brother and my daughters uncle. I've known him for over 10 years now. *sigh....we spent almost 2 weeks in Virginia, to testify against him and give a statement on how it has affected me. The kicker though is, I didnt just have to stand up against him but also his family. Who showed up to support him. (Not us) 
I am beyond emotionally and mentally exhausted. Thank God, I had at least my daughter and fiance for support! 
I never wanted to be apart of the #metoo movement but here I am. I only pray that my daughter never goes through anything like I have. And i am so sorry, for anyone else who has been. No one should have to go through this or have to defend themselves bc they were the victim. 
Needless to say, I won't take that families last name.

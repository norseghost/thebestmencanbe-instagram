THROWBACK TWO YEAR UPDATED CAPTION:
#myreactionwhen someone publicly states they don’t tolerate abuse but ignore me when I tell them their friends are abusive.

This was such a pivotal moment in my life, being on a stage like that of @punkrockbowling. I don’t think I’ll ever get the chance again BUT IT’S COOL because I’m playing a crazy good fest in August for @aklasanrecords, performing music that I wrote without the stranglehold of creativity Posers had me in.

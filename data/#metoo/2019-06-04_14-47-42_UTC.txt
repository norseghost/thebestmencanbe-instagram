ðŸŒ¿The New York Times just published an article on @alexauder, crowning her Yogaâ€™s Instagram Provocateur. ðŸŒ¿ And I just LOVE what she is doing. She has found a way of reconciling her passion for yoga and teaching yoga with the strange position she finds herself situated in as a privileged white woman in an insta-image landscape of commodified spiritual practices. ðŸŒ¿
ðŸŒ¿So thirlled to see her challenge notions of wellness as they relate to wealth, beauty, and whiteness. Equally inspiring to watch her use social media, the very pedestal so many use to prop themselves up as experts, to undermine and question the culture and long-held notions of authority in the yoga world. ðŸŒ¿ She even exposes the mysogyny and abuse of long-revered yoga Gods such as Iyengar and K. Pattabhi Jois. "But where would we be without Iyengar?" she ponders satirically in one of her insta-videos. This, after posting a video of Iyengar striking a student for improper placement of their blanket for headstand. Following this nonsensical dismissal to its illogical end, she concludes, "Maybe I would be living in Mexico and my children would not be my children." ðŸŒ¿ This is such an interesting moment in time. The digital world is making it impossible to claim any spiritual authority without also exposing one's own hypocrisy. ðŸŒ¿
ðŸŒ¿ Perhaps art, with its open-endedness and tolerance for paradox, is the only means of adequately addressing these complexities while still exploring the questions of what it means to live an ethical life, to be in community, to have a spriitual practice, to contribute, and to teach?

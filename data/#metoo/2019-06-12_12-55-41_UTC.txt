The plight of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people is said to be the world's fastest growing refugee crisis.
Risking death by sea or on foot, nearly 700,000 have fled the destruction of their homes and persecution in the northern Rakhine province of Myanmar (Burma) for neighbouring Bangladesh since August 2017.
Help stop the genocide in Myanmar! 
Spread the word, stop the silence and end the genocidal violence!

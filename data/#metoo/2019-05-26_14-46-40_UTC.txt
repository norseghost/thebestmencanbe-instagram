The artist’s way ❤️ #ididitmyway 
I wrote this poem a while ago when I experienced a similar energy like I feel today. This morning I woke up with these words again and during the day I got a clear picture of why. Recently I dropped the mask I’ve had on for many years. Making me feel vulnerable? Yes. But at the same time the little girls dream I had before putting on the mask is back and it’s rising. It was not that long ago that I started speaking up about my experiences with sexual abuse. And since then I’m in the process of transforming my womanhood, the way I see myself as a woman as well as the way I present myself to the world. At this point this means I feel it’s time to align my outside appearance with how I saw ‘the future me’ when I was a girl. And she sure knew how a #queen of the world looks like.. To make a long story short: I’m on the move to get my appearance act together and having loads of fun while doing so ✨ Already know the date and occasion to present ‘the new me’ too 😊 To be continued.. Did you notice too how quickly I managed to create a ‘little secret’ again? Well not really a secret of course, this one will be visible and out in the open soon, but not just yet.. Must be the artist’s way again making sure it’s going my way ❤️ Beautiful story don’t you think? 😘

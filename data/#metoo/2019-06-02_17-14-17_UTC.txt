Happy Pride month! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 The time of the year where capitalism markets and profits off of our identity & experiences🙄. Nonetheless, we will celebrate ourselves all year round and not be used as a token or a part of the “diversity agenda” that often lacks real progression or genuineness. This is a reminder that #Pride has always been about protest, taking up space and celebrating who we are despite folks who don’t accept us. Lots of love, OWV! #ourwomensvoices #lgbt #lgbtq #Queer

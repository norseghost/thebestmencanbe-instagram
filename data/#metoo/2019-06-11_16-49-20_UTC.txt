"At a time when women worldwide are stepping increasingly into roles of influence, women’s rights are also being constrained at many levels. At Miss Hall’s, we believe in developing voice in our students, so that they can advocate for human rights for all, so that ‘#metoo’ can mean ‘I, too, have voice in this world.’"

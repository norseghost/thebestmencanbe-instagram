.... I'm alive. I'm here. Living, laughing, praying, praising... crying tears of joy and thankfulness... having a moment... Wednesday May 23, 2018... The enemy tried to take me out. Kidnapped, beat me, held a gun to my head... I was looking death in the face... I prayed so hard for God to spare my life for my kids. And guess what?! He did... 1 year later... I'm here. Living... God is amazing... tears flowing down my face... I'm alive... God is faithful... I still trust Him... no weapon formed against me will prosper... ever! His promises... #noweapon #domesticviolence #domesticviolenceawareness #lovegod #loveyourself #loveyourkids #trustgod #speakup #getaway #stayaway #beblessed #metoo

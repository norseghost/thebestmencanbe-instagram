Show 4: @tootsiemusical 
I really can’t stop talking about how much I liked #Tootsie!  Having grown up watching the movie I was interested to see how they brought it into today’s world of #MeToo.  I loved how they adapted the story to be relevant and how they addressed it directly, with grace and humor!

I know it doesn’t happen every night - but during our performance (Tuesday, June 4) there was a malfunction with the closet door - and I don’t think I’ve laughed that hard in a long time!  Watching actors deal with mishaps live on stage - with flare - there’s nothing better. “And we’re back!” I also can’t not mention @lulubellestiles - I mean, holy shiz! I know what happens!!! Another nod to @todaytix for being the place to get tickets!! #tootsiemusical #santinofontana #lillicooper #sarahstiles #coloringbroadway

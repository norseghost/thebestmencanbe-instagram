Today I am filled with anger over power dynamics and abuse. I’m angry at the frequency of people in power using that power to hurt people and keep them quiet. Nothing gives you the right to abuse or violate others. And then to use that very system of power to protect yourself and destroy your victim. I’m angry at the people and institutions who look the other way and enable these abusers. I’m angry at those who victim blame high on their soap boxes or who can’t be bothered to get involved unless it’s convenient for them. How are we supposed to trust the system when sometimes it’s the system failing us? Where are we supposed to go? This has happened to me and I am so so so sorry if it has happened to you on any level. #sexualassaultawareness #trauma #traumaawareness #supportsurvivors #empowersurvivors #believesurvivors #traumainformed #sexualassault #rape #abuse #resilience #metoo #metoomanyvoices #victim #survivor #education #resource #support #recovery #courage #mentoo #mentalhealthawareness #endvictimblaming #healing #power #traumahealing #ptsdrecovery #ptsd #ptsdawareness

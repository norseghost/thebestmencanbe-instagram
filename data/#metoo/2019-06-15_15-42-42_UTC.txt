Looking for individuals interested in sharing their stories of empowerment, trauma, misogyny, gender, race, issues of equality and the list goes on. Share your voice, AND get some photos if you’d like. These can be shared or just for you. This is to create a platform for voices to be heard and stories to be amplified throughout our communities via photography and writings on the subject. What ARE we talking about? This is in the incubator stage so ideas ideas and more ideas welcome. Contact me here on IG or by email (link in bio) if you have an idea and we’ll make it happen! Much love everyone and hope to collab with many beautiful souls.

I wrote this about a year ago, and I am so grateful for the conversations that I’ve been exposed to which have allowed me to realize this was a dynamic in our society and also in my life. Sex can be complicated; particularly if you’re never given the words to talk about it. It’s impossible to intellectualize, nonetheless emotionally process something you don’t have the words to articulate. #metoo and other mainstream dialogs have helped me learn language to talk about sex - not just in terms of consent, but also in terms of things like the pleasure gap, or even how to define “good” sex and the spectrum of what that can mean. So yes, sex can be complicated, but it can also be really fun. Maybe I should write more poems about that 🤔👅

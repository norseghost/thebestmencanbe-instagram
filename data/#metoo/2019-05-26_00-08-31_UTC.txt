Considering this was our second campaign, I am pretty damn happy with the outcome of our indiegogo campaign. Although we didn’t hit our goal, this amount covers exactly what I need to pay for lodging and food for the 4 days of shooting.
Yes, of course we could use a lot more... but that’s what credit cards are for!!!
Thank you to everyone who contributed, shared the campaign, and just overall wished us luck! We could no do this without the support of our fans, family, and friends!

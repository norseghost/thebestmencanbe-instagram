‚ÄúI lost everything after I was raped. I was imprisoned, I lost my home and my children lost their future‚Äù - Tran Thi Ngai

Tran Thi Ngai is one of many women raped by South Korean soldiers during the Vietnam War. 
Justice for Lai Dai Han is currently raising money to pay for educational scholarships for young members of the Lai Dai Han community. Money raised through fundraising efforts goes directly to the victims and their children, many of which live in poor rural communities and suffer from low levels of literacy and poor access to education, healthcare and other social services. üó£ Please support us and donate to make a difference - link in bio!

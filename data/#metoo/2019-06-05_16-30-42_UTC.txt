"BECAUSE I believe with my wholeheartmindbody that girls constitute a revolutionary soul force that can, and will change the world for real."⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

For the better part of the last few decades, I have been majorly inspired by the #RiotGrrrl movement both as a woman and as a writer. For those unfamiliar, it was a female driven punk movement in the early 1990's that threw a fist in the air (and, sure, maybe a middle finger or two) to make space for women in art, music, and LIFE. This was the original statement put in the Riot Grrrl zine (DC chapter) in 1992. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Kathleen Hanna, lead singer/songwriter of notorious Riot Grrrl band @bikinikillrecords, has inspired names of several of my characters through the years. Kat in IF I STAY anyone? And Corin Tucker, of @sleater_kinney was once in a band called Heavens to Betsy and their song "Firefly" remains one of my favorites and is pivotal in I WAS HERE. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

So I'm psyched that tonight for my birthday—see how I slipped that in— I get to take my two badass, feminist daughters and my feminist husband to see Bikini Kill. I get older. They get older. The revolution continues....⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

"Because every time we pick up a pen, or an instrument, or get anything done, we are creating the revolution. We ARE the revolution."⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

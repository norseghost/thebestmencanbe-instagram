It’s been one year since I was raped. One year sober. I shared my story on my story (pun not intended). It is fairly graphic and contains potentially triggering details, so please keep yourselves safe and do not read it if you are triggered by such things. My goal here is to create a community where survivors of sexual assault, harassment, and abuse all feel safe. I hope you will help me in this endeavor. Thank you for your time. You are safe and your life is appreciated by many.

The perpetrator is hardly ever a stranger or someone unknown to you... .

Perpetrators are people we know and love, they are the â€˜averageâ€™ dad, â€˜friendlyâ€™ brother or â€˜ mild mannered â€˜ uncle. They are usually trusted family members and friends of the survivor. 
Itâ€™s difficult to speak out because as a survivor you feel compelled to remain silent - out of obligation or fear- there is no where to turn. 
WARIF is here for you, if you have been raped or sexually assaulted please visit us at 6, Turton Street, Off Thorburn Avenue, Yaba or call our 24 hour confidential helpline on 08092100009.

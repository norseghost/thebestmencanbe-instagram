Our co-creator is crowdfunding for her other project:The Receptionist! A film that addresses the power of silence in business, protecting the people at the top while destroying anyone who tries to speak up. The story follows the receptionist as a major sex scandal comes to light at the company she works at. Having some damning evidence she has to decide if she’s willing to face the very real consequences of coming forward. Based on the writer/directors experience working at the Weinstein company! Please consider donate to this badass and important story and if you can’t consider sharing. Link in @stephitupsalgado bio!

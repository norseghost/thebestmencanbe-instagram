Everey tear, I'm crying about this...
I am worth it.
Everey post I'm making about this...
I am worth it.
Everey breath of my life I've taken and I am constantly taking....
I am worth it.
Everey boundary I am setting,
I am worth it
To find myself again, and to becoming myself more and more
I am worth it. 
And so,
you are too.

The last day I ever drank alcohol was my wedding day... | Part II

“20 years of covering court trials and I don’t think I’ve ever seen a rape victim who was that poised, that brave, that strong...who was able to look her rapist in the eye and say ‘you did this and now you’re going to pay.’” - news anchor.

After leaving school in NYC and returning to the Midwest, I laid low for awhile. I attended AA meetings, got a job, and even moved in with my AA Sponsor. Life was good, but only for awhile.
.
In April of 2009, after a night out with friends, I was brutally raped and beaten by a stranger who helped me change my flight tire. I remember the poking and prodding at the hospital as the nurses and police officers asked me how much I’d had to drink. I remember his Defense team questioning my credibility because I had taken shots of tequila that night. I was riddled with shame and guilt. “I’m to blame,” I would tell myself. “Had I not been drinking I never would have let him into my car.”
.
But after a nearly two-year trial and 60-year sentencing, the media championed me as “the survivor who refused to be broken.” They labeled me as brave, and strong. So I felt like I had to live up to that public persona—that I couldn’t show my pain, my “weakness.” So again, I drank, running from my pain, burying and hiding it below the surface.
.
Not even a year after the trial, I was in a car with a friend when they got pulled over for a DUI. As the police officers went to pull me out of the vehicle so they could give me a ride home, I had a flashback from the night of my assault, and I snapped.
.
It was in a 6x8 jail cell, in a bright orange jumpsuit, that I was forced to come came face to face with my pain for the first time. No more running. No more numbing. No alcohol or toxic relationships or busyness to mask the pain. It was just me and my pain. I was caged in. I could see it. I could touch it. I could feel it. So I allowed it to wash over me...and I didn’t drown.
.
A few days later I stood in front of the judge. “I know who you are,” she said. “You’re the survivor from that rape case...”

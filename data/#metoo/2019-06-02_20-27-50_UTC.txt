Last year's short film, "Purgatory" was partially inspired by the paintings of the legendary Spanish surrealist, Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dalí. This time around I find inspiration from the legendary American painter, Hughie Lee-Smith, for the making of our upcoming short film, "The Monster In My Closet.” #NewHarlemRenaissanceProductions #NewHarlemFilms

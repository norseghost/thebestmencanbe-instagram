We tell ourselves stories.
We get the words from others around us. If our parents and influencers didn't know that loving ourselves was an option, how would we know? .
.

If our parents were raised in a world not to say good things about themselves for fear of appearing vain, that wasn't their fault. .
.

We always get to caught up in the why. 
Why are we like this? 
Why haven't we learned this? 
Whose fault is it? Who needs to be held accountable? .
.

It's you. .
.

You are the only one who can use self-love to love yourself. 
I can stand here loving you. 
Your parents can stand here loving you. 
Your partner can bring you presents every single day and write songs for you. .
.

but you will always feel broken and lonely until you invite love 
of yourself 
into your life. .
.

And for that, my dear, the question of 'why' needs to be dropped in a corner. 
The question of 'what' needs to be explored instead: 
As in....
What do I like? 
What do I want? 
What do I need? 
What can I do? 
What can I let go of? .
.

You learn to love yourself by practicing loving yourself. One day at a time.
You don't start all at once. Nothing ever happens all at once. 
It doesn't matter how long it takes. 
We all start at our step one.

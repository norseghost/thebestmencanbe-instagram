y’all really think calling me a snowflake is an insult?? i find insults to be more: ’you’re selfish and just care about yourself’ or ’what the fuck is wrong with you, you ignorant fuck these kids need help stop being selfish for once’ but i mean sure, i am sOOoOoOoOo offended bc i’m a fucking snowflake. i mean now i can’t go out there and help traumatized kids bc i’m a snowflake, i’m so offended that i can’t do good anymore. leave me so i can just cry and not help kids bc apparently that makes me a bad person. {m}

"The most powerful thing is that Iâ€™m getting to know myself, and I am loving every side of myself. Iâ€™m not so quick to be concerned about the fact that this part is a little bit jagged or rugged.

Or this part might be a little bit, you know, super raw. Or this part might be a little bit down or sad. I donâ€™t have to pretend like Iâ€™m not all those things. I donâ€™t have to be in the perfect mood or do all the right things. I can just be off and I can also be my greatest self.

I can be the mixed-up emotions that we all are. So Iâ€™m just loving getting to know all of me and then being able to express that in these different musical facets. I would never have been able to do it before now, because I didnâ€™t have my big-girl panties on the way that they are on, securely, now. Iâ€™m allowed to have cute panties and not-so-cute panties. Whatever! Iâ€™m just loving being good with that." - #AliciaKeys for #EssenceMagazine ðŸ’–

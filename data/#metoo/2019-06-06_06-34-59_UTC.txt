I'll be the first to admit, some of the inspirational stuff we post is a little corny. Or is it cheesy? Or both? 
But you know what? Corn and cheese are good. If you think about it, they're basically nachos. Who doesn't love nachos when you're going through a rough patch? Move over chicken soup, I've got nachos for your soul! 
My point is, whether or not you like my soul nachos, everything we post about believing and supporting survivors is true. Whatever you're going through, you don't have to walk this road alone. We're right here with you. And we have nachos.

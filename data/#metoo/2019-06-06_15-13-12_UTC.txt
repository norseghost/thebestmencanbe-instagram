This is what is meant when we talk about #patriarchy: The father of the man who murdered the family was able to get copies of the entire murdered family's autopsies, while the father of the murdered mother was only allowed to see those of his blood relatives. "The point is the view that the man owns it." Even after murdering his family, they are still seen as his property, which, upon his death, reverted to the ownership of his closest male relative.

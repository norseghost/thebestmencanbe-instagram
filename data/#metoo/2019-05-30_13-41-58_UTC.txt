Today, the @wbadc will be holding an event—"Recognizing and Learning from GOOD Guys: Guys Overcoming Obstacles to Diversity”—moderated by Sanford Heisler Sharp DC Partner Kate Mueting at Sanford Heisler Sharp’s DC office. The GOOD Guys program is designed to break the impasse in women’s advancement by engaging people who have been missing from the conversation for too long – the guys!

Really upsetting and unfortunate to get the update that the police filed a ‘B summary report’ in actor Tanushree Dutta’s case; where she alleged sexual harassment against actor Nana Patekar and reignited the MeToo movement in India. A ‘B summary report’ means that the IO (police) has found no evidence to file the chargesheet. Tanushree Dutta alleges that the police has not followed due process and that her witnesses were not called to give testimony. She continues her crusade of over a decade to seek justice and will file a petition in High Court. 
On the basis on the facts put forth in her case and having worked on ground on these issues, I stand in solidarity with Tanushree. 
This is not solely a one-woman problem. Sexual harassment affects us all. In India, conviction rate for crimes against women is 19%. Whereas the avg conviction rate for other crimes is 47%. Pending cases for crimes against women increased from 1081756 to 1204786. 
Out of which 1/3rd of the cases police investigation still hasn’t wrapped up and delay has been from the police’s end. There is no effective process to ensure compliance when it comes to sexual harassment at the workplace (POSH Act). We expect women to “speak up and be strong” and when they do, they get victim blamed and shamed, ostracised at the workplace and are seen as “non-complaint and unhirable”. Even those who follow due process and seek legal recourse are met with systematic hurdles and failures. If we are serious about our country’s development then we need to address these systematic failures head on. 
We need to stop letting down the women of our country and do everything we can to remove these barriers that stop us from seeking employment, working and living a quality life. #MeToo

Iâ€™ll Set A Trip
You grab my hand and say letâ€™s play, 
in truth I come without a name. 
Iâ€™ll hold your hand and walk you home, 
Iâ€™m faithful till weâ€™re gray and old. 
I show you light without the tunnel, 
weâ€™ll walk through death to love eternal. 
Iâ€™ll come back to you every time, 
Iâ€™m god in form as you are mine. 
Iâ€™ve held you close and pushed you far, 
our love may bend but never far. 
I see your face as I close my eyes, 
Iâ€™ll think of you the day I die. 
Iâ€™ll set a course into your eyes, 
my final trip to drop disguise.  Mantra_matt ðŸ’šðŸ”¥ðŸ’š.

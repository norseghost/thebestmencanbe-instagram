Blisters, bunions, and blood are just a few consequences of squeezing human feet into high heels. ⠀
⠀
However, Japan’s labour minister, Takumi Nemoto, thought it was his place to declare, during a parliamentary debate, that wearing high heels “is necessary and reasonable” in the workplace... Despite this rule not being applicable to him. ⠀
⠀
While many people across the world choose to wear heels, it seems bizarre that a person would think it appropriate to comment on a different gender's dress code with such authority. ⠀
⠀
Perhaps the women of Japan would like to invite Takumi Nemoto to wear heels to work for a week before offering opinions on what is deemed "necessary" to wear to work.⠀

We'd love to know your thoughts, comment below. ⠀

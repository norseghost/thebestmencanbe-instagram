"One day I know, if I go theres just no telling how far I go" ðŸŒŠðŸŒŠ Being full on at work I have neglected myself. To be the brightest we can be, we need time for ourselves we need to do what we can to make us whole.  With in this time I have stopped talking, I have stopped being open and started to push everything back down inside. With PTSD we need to be open we need to deal with what is causing the trauma. ðŸ§¡ðŸ§¡

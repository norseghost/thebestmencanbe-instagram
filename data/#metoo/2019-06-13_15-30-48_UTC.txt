Today’s Pop Up is ‘How Gender Politics Play Out on the Red Carpet’. Here the New Yorker looks at the history of the red carpet and the way in which it has evolved alongside celebrity culture. In doing so, there is a discussion as to whether the influence of the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements have changed red-carpet culture. You can watch this over on our Docsville Facebook page. #docsville #documentary #redcarpet #gender

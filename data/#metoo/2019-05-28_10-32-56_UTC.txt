Wow. Just watched the movie Ben Is Back. 💔

What a true account of having a person that you love that has a very real addiction. 
Some of you may not know that I was in a relationship for a couple of years with a man that I truly wanted to help. In my eyes he just needed someone to love him, be there for him, to help him. But he didn’t want that. And it took me a long time to realise. 
It ruined me at the time and opened my eyes up to a very unknown scary world. 
He would tell me everything I wanted to hear, use my own insecurities against me, and he completely isolated me. So much so that he made me move to Perth. One of the most isolated cities in the world. I knew no one. 
There was a lot of fear, but every time I would try to leave he would tell me he would kill himself and that he just needed me to help him get better. 
When I woke up with his hands around my throat one night after he had been on another bender and he broke my phone, chopped up my credit cards, stole my money and had me screaming for my life, running to the neighbours in the middle of the night half naked - the police were called. I was issued with a restraining order which would last 24 hours and I was told to use that time to pack up as much as I could and get out. 
I did. And then I got a text message a few days later that made my blood run cold. 
He told me he couldn’t go on. He was going to end his life. And I knew in my heart that he wasn’t joking. 
I got to the house just in time. He had overdosed. His eyes were rolled back in his head, he had froth coming out of his mouth and he wasn’t breathing. I called an ambulance crying and screaming. 
He had always told me that if he died, it would be all my fault. And in that moment I truly felt like I had let him down. 
When my phone was smashed, I lost every single photo of my time in Perth. And he didn’t let me have Facebook (more isolation) so I have absolutely nothing to show for my time in this relationship or living in Perth. I feel like now, it is a blessing. 
One thing I learned in this whole process was you cannot help someone that doesn’t want to be helped. I’m sure there could have been easier ways to learn this. 👇🏽👇

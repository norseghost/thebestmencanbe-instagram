Reposted from @iamdaliasmith -  We've all been through painful experiences that have shaped who we've become. Don't diminish those experiences or feel badly about them. They were presented to you for a reason. Part of healing is to lean into those feelings of pain instead of running away from them. It can be incredibly terrifying to open Pandora's box, but letting those feelings come to the surface and really feeling into them is the only way to heal and move forward. Today, choose to be thankful for them and find the lessons in those experiences. Push your way through this chapter and trust that your story is about to become more beautiful than you could ever imagine.üôèüíó‚ú® - #regrann

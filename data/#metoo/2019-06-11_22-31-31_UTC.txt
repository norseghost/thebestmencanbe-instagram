#MeToo “The bravest of women 
All over the world,
Uniting as one;
An army of girls.
Their voices 
Once silent;
Diminished and quiet.
It is hard now 
To silence the roar 
Of our riot.
Not ever again;
NO!
We will NOT 
Be silent.
We will NOT 
Shrink down.
We will NOT 
Be quiet.
You will squirm 
At the thought 
Of what we’ve been through.
And you can thank 
Your lucky stars 
If you are lucky enough,
To be able to say 
That it never happened 
To you. 
The nightmare 
We lived;
The things 
We survived.
Some days 
The pain still cuts me so deep,
That I am barely able
To open my eyes.
Let alone
Have the bravery,
To not run and hide;
The strength 
To let anyone 
See beyond my walls;
To view the horror 
Of what’s still left inside.
What will it take?
How many 
Of these stories 
Still need to be told 
Before people get it?
Before this world 
Is alive and WOKE?
Those of us 
Who have suffered;
Our eyes 
Have never been closed.
We’ve been forced 
To keep them open;
Many of us, 
Since only four or five years old.
And we always carry 
These memories with us;
The nightmares and the shame.
And for so very many of us,
We were told 
That we were to blame.
It’s hard to describe this pain 
That I feel.
Hearing all these stories, 
It truly is the worst kind of surreal.
To be able to comfort 
And validate each other;
To know deep down, 
That we are truly not alone.
Yet still wishing somehow, 
It never happened to another;
Not to any girl or woman;
Not to any daughter or mother.
My bones are aching.
My knees are shaking.
My voice is cracking,
But I will keep on speaking;
As my tears 
Continue to flow like a river,
From the very core of my being.
We are safe here,
In each other’s stories.
We are lovingly cradled,
As we link 
Arm in arm;
As we begin to connect 
Shattered heart, to shattered heart.
As we reach out
For each other’s hand. 
We are warriors,
And we are mighty.
We are a force 
To be reckoned with. 
No longer will our pain,
Be taken so lightly.
You never know the power,
Of what sharing your story can do.
And although we are stronger
As we all band together,
My heart is still broken,
Over every, #MeToo

ripped straight from my sketchbook five minutes ago.
yesterday.
"where are you trying to go? i could drive you just get in." from a disgusting man who hung out of the window as if it wasn't a choice. it was horrifying. i know too many women/trans people who have had experiences like mine. i have many of my own. every man i have too see i have to assess their threat to me. is this normal? barked at on the street, treated like you're less than human?

Meet @taranajaneen. As a survivor of sexual violence, Tarana turned her experience into an avenue to help other women by creating the ‘Me Too’ movement in 2006—a full decade before the #MeToo hashtag went viral.  Her organization Just Be Inc #justbeinc was created to support and educate young women of color who have been victimized. Keep shining Tarana⭐. #womaninbusiness #womanpreneur #Wednesdaywisdom#Wednesdaymotivation #wednesdaymorning #wednesdayquote #wcw #wellnesswednesday #womancrushwednesday

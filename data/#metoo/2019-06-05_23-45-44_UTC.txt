Statistic #2 
One big common stereotype about men has been the one that says "men are naturally violent". It's clear that anyone could accept that way of thinking just by looking at this statistic. But it isn't acceptable.
.
Men are not "naturally" violent. To only thing that could relate to that is the fact that men has a natural reaction program installed in the brain. And most specifically, in the amygdala. But this only relates to aggressiveness, which is a natural response to external stimuli where the subject meets a survival situation (a threat, for example). The curious thing, is that women also has this natural reaction system. So, where's the difference?
.
The key is in differentiating aggressiveness from violence. Aggressiveness comes from the amygdala, which helps us react in life threatening situations, but violence is more related to the prefrontal cortex, which is the one responsible to regulate and adapt the amygdala activity. In short - violence comes when the subject does not use his prefrontal cortex (which is something anyone can learn, through self awareness, emotional expression, etc).
.
This makes a lot of sense. Being surrounded by a culture where boys are taught to hide and disconnect from their emotions (not crying, not expressing what they feel), it's an obvious outcome that grown men lack control of their aggressive responses. .
Men are not naturally violent. Culture and wrong masculine stereotypes has built up generations of men that does not know how to stop, think, and learn from conflict. .

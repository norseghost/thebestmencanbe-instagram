                        "text": "\u203c\ufe0fTRIGGER WARNING: rape, incest, sexual assault. \u203c\ufe0f \u201cI was only three the first time\u2026I have a disability, sensory perception. I couldn\u2019t talk until I was four because of it. It was my own father who molested me for years. The last time, I was eight. He\u2019d\u2026use his fingers on me, I\u2019d bleed every time. My mother was the only one who worked, my older brother is 9 years older and my younger brother is 4 years younger. My father hated the boys, I was his angel. It didn\u2019t go too far, not like other cases. He\u2019d tell me that all father and daughters do it. It\u2019s a bonding activity. I was only young, how could I know?When I was eight, he tried raping me for the first time. I\u2019m glad I lied and said I needed to use the bathroom. I can even remember the time. 11:30 pm. My mom left him when I was seven, I only visited on weekends. That was the last weekend I went over. I\u2019m 16 now and I finally told my mother. I haven\u2019t seen my father in years. I\u2019m in counseling, and I\u2019m getting better. Step by step. I just wanna say, there\u2019s no reason to be ashamed. No matter how you dress, what you talk about, what you do. That doesn\u2019t give anyone permission to hurt you. You\u2019re not to blame, they are for thinking so. That\u2019s my story, I know it\u2019s not much. I\u2019m hoping this will help someone else.\u201d - anonymous \nAs always, send your stories to catscallingback@gmail.com or DM me. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n #ipadproart #illustration #illustratorsofinstagram #womenwhodraw #procreate #procreateart #womenofillustration \n#creative #girlssupportinggirls #girlpower #girlgang #streetharassment #harassmentstories #notyourbaby #timesup #metoo #femaleempowerment #womenempoweringwomen #womenempowerment #feminism #feminist #catscallingback #strongwomen #survivor #assaultsurvivor #therapy"

                        "text": "Have you ever hoped you would read a book about what it\u2019s like to be a woman?  All of it.  Everything.  Boys snapping your bra as a pre-teen and no one cared that it was humiliating; Creepy old men hitting on you as a teenager, being afraid to tell anyone for fear they\u2019d say you were \u201casking for it\u201d; boys making jokes about your boobs in high school; having to be afraid and come up with a plan with friends at frat parties in college; never leaving anyone behind at a club in your 20s; trying to figure out how to be a mom and a career; deciding you don\u2019t care about a career, but feeling judged for that (and knowing other women felt judged for not wanting to be a mom or for being a working mom). Now you can be a lesbian and have children, but it wasn\u2019t always that way and that\u2019s a whole other thing.  And you think no one understands it and it\u2019s so much more difficult than it has to be.  And why aren\u2019t women paid the same as men and why don\u2019t men get judged for sleeping around and why do men still - and some unknowingly - wield this power?  Did you ever want to read a book about all of that?  Which is to say, a book about what it means to be a woman today.\n\nI was born in 1972, I thought the world would always be embroidered bell bottoms and float shirts and music would  always sound like The Eagles and Barry Manilow.  Moms stayed home until their kids were in school and then they worked as secretaries or receptionists or lunch aides.  In high school, in the 80s, I was fascinated by hippies and \u201cwomen\u2019s libbers\u201d \ud83d\ude44as feminists were called.  I wanted to know more, I wanted to know what it felt like to be right there as it changed.\n\nMrs. Everything is the book I\u2019ve always wanted to read but it didn\u2019t exist.  Until now.  Thank you @jenniferweinerwrites for writing this book that captures what it means to be a woman in America today. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb Thank you @atrabooks for my finished copy.\n#mrseverything #women  #womensrights #americangirl #americanwoman #lgbtq #pride #equality #nationalorganizationforwomen #feminist #equalpayforequalwork #sisterhood #sisters #togetherwecan #metoo #liberal #progressive #ibelieveher #booksharks #booksparks #genxbookstagrammers"

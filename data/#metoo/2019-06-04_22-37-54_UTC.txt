Do you like tattoos?

Do you want to help support your local rape crisis center?

If you answered yes to these questions, then you are in luck! @pushing_tradition is hosting a fundraiser to benefit RCCCNM! They could have chosen any other organization that helps survivors, and they chose to support RCCCNM!

The fundraiser is part of an even larger event happening all across the country called @stillnotaskingforit_flashevent. The event was started because a tattoo artist noticed that the tattoo community sometimes had a lack of sympathy for survivors of sexual violence; "Still Not Asking For It was created with the purpose of finding real allies, bringing them together, and showing the community that we are here & we care."
❗️
- The fundraiser is a flash day which means that all the designs/tattoos have already been created on flash sheets. You will be able to pick something off the flash sheet to have tattooed on you, but you cannot change the designs!
-  The money from every tattoo will be donated to RCCCNM, and the tattoo artist will get to keep whatever tip you give them.
-  The day is first come, first served! If you are really excited about getting a tattoo, we do suggest showing up as close to the start time as you can.
❗️
Join us and the amazing artists at Pushing Tradition on June 9th (this Sunday!). The event kicks off at 12, so come by early to make sure you get a spot!

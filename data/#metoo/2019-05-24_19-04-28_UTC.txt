A person texted me yesterday on insta.  He asked me "Do you realize the number of men who get harassed mentally and physically too at work and even beyond the boundaries? And yes, we cannot open up about it because the society will make me a culprit and find the means to choke my throat!" To my friend out there- Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I understand. This post is for you and many more men out there who might have/are experiencing this. Please speak up, the society needs to see and hear the truth to bring a change. We stand by you and with you to support the truth and cause!!! PS- I checked on how a man could complain or raise concern. Looks like we really need to stop thinking of harassment as a women only topic and look at Indian laws in gender neutral way be it POSCO or SHEBOX. 
Let us go back to the days of our scriptures where the Lord portrayed himself as "Ardhanarishwar' , those days of childhood and innocence when male and female dint matter- what mattered was the language of love and mutual understanding! 
Thank you for being my story people ❤️ @vbhaskarla

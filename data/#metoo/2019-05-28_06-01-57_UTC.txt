I am aware is not necessarily obtainable by a lot of people to access or afford some of these products. I had to wrestle with putting them out to the world because of the high cost. However, I have to give up a lot of things including often an entertainment budget or eating in restaurants in order to eat healthy. And after all the research that regular food is so expensive - paying generally 15% more on some products to even 50% more on others that don't have much nutrient density like a loaf of bread - it's something I just have to do in order to feel well. However I think I can do better by starting this little Coop and getting some people who cannot access this logistically are financially on board to get wholesale prices of 10 Staples including Lydias. #craveadifferentkindofbuzz

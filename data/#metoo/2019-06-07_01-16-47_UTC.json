I couldn\u2019t have done it without every single person who BOUGHT a shirt, DONATED to my cause, & SUPPORTED me by sharing the fundraiser. Thank you all so, so very much.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nGoing into selling shirts, I was so worried that it wouldn\u2019t work out. A minimum of 20 had to be purchased for them to go into print, so every day I was stressing that I wouldn\u2019t make it. Sales were slow at first, one or two every few days, but then one night I got over 15 sales & multiple donations... in only a few hours! I remember texting one of my good friends, so excited at the slew of people all of a sudden investing into Created in the Chaos. It gave me hope & reassured me that I have something amazing here. Next time, we\u2019ll have double the sales, I know it. \ud83c\udf37 Don\u2019t forget to send in pictures of you wearing your #CitC shirt to be featured on our story!!!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow @createdinthechaos for more."

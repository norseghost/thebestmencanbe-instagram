Praises to Keanu!  I personally don’t want to be touched or handled by men who aren’t my significant other or family member.  If a coworker touches me, I expect it to be because he is shaking my hand.  If a close male friend touches me, it should be because he is greeting me with a hug or putting his arm on my shoulder (not waist) for a photo.  I know not all women feel the same way, but there’s never harm in asking.  I’m not about to confront men who touch me, but I definitely appreciate men who touch me about the same amount as they touch other men.  It’s about women’s equality and women’s agency.  #feminism #womenempowerment #metoo #feminist

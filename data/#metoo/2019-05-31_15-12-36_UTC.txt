As you go through the process of healing, you will learn the importance of establishing boundaries. At a personal level, boundaries teach us that we have a choice. They make up our identity. Boundaries determine what we will and will not do or stand for. Learning to say “no” can be very empowering. There is nothing wrong with saying, “no”. Further abuse can take place when the survivor doesn’t think that she has a choice in the situation; this is not true. You have a choice as to what you will or will not do when it comes to your body. #notjustahashtagpodcast

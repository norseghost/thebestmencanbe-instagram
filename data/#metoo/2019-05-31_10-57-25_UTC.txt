“I was never asked to share. I never brought what happened to me to anyone’s attention other than my best friend at the time. She was somewhat supportive in whatever way a 16-year-old can be in such a situation.” If you have a gut feeling that something is wrong with a friend and you think the “something” might have been a sexual assault, challenge yourself to ask them. Give them a safe space and permission to talk about what happened to them without asking prying questions or judging them.

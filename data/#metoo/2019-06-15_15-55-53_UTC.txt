This is my poem The 'Not All Men' Men. I am tired of hearing the words 'not all men' come from the mouths of men who jump to defending the men who don't do these things instead of condemning those who do.
.
Guys, stand up for your sisters. Call out your brothers. Accept that there is a problem, and use your powerful male voice to call for change.
.
Every woman I know has been catcalled or made to feel uncomfortable or sent unsolicited content or touched when they never asked for any of it. Stop saying 'not all men' and start saying 'yes all women'.

“I see a better way forward. I’m not going anywhere. I’m still here. We’re still here.” CC ⠀ ⠀

Last week @trinaaltman posted an important piece shedding light on the abuse of power that has recently been revealed in yoga but has sadly been in play for many decades. Unfortunately yoga is not unique. This happens all over the world in fields beyond movement modalities.

Following Trina’s post my friend and colleague @caitlincasella said “I’m posting this quote by Chris Emdin again because it strikes at the heart of everything I’m thinking and feeling right now. He isn’t coming from the yoga world, but speaks in terms that are most applicable to what we’re all going through. He writes, “you become a good teacher when your presence is not needed for learning to happen. You become most capable when your students make you replaceable. You are closest to mastering your craft when your presence enhances but without you the class still dances.”

I am very lucky that my most intimate relationship with Iyengar yoga started with a teacher who, very much like me, colors outside of the lines and teaches from a place of passion and compassion. You know who you are @carrieowerko ❤️ From the beginning of our explorations together 11yrs ago, she broke all the rules and let me dance in my space. She invites curiosity, integrity, and play. These are things I have always valued and practiced in my life as a student, a mover, and as a teacher.

However, this is not how it goes for many people and this wasn’t always the case for me either. Just 3yrs ago while I was 32wks pregnant, I took class with “THE most senior” Iyengar teacher next to the family. When I entered this practice I was humbled, excited, and ready to learn. The class was miserable from the first 10 minutes. I was made a spectacle and yelled at in front of 40 people I’d never met. It was the most emotionally and physically disturbing, infuriating, and embarrassing experience of my entire relationship with yoga. I left sobbing, demeaned, and angry. We have to speak up.

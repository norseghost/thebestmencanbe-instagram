Burke calls her nonprofit\u2019s movement \u201cMe Too.\u201d The phrase came to Burke in 1997 after she heard a 13-year-old sexual abuse survivor share her story during a youth camp.\n\n\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udfd4, \ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfce\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd3: Almost precisely two years before she was quoted in the Times expos\u00e9, Ashley Judd writes an essay in Variety detailing being sexually harassed by a then-unnamed media boss in a hotel room, who she now says was Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udfd3,  \ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfce\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd5: Along with other actresses and former Weinstein Company employees, Ashley Judd accuses Weinstein of sexual harassment \u2014 this time, on the record \u2014 in Jodi Kantor and Meghan Twohey's incriminating New York Times story. In the aftermath, Weinstein publishes a public apology, the first of many public apologies the year would hold. In the ensuing days, over 100 women would could come forward with allegations against Weinstein.\n\n\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd4, \ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfce\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd5: The #MeToo hashtag movement is born on Twitter after Alyssa Milano encourages people to share their stories of sexual harassment and abuse in order to illustrate the near universality of the problem. #MeToo quickly becomes an international phenomenon, with women different countries translating the hashtag or creating their own."

Been in the worst relapse recently 
TW
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I’ve been setting a stop watch to see how long I can last without eating and I’ve been purging every little bite. Im so disappointed in myself, and I like my page to be positive and focused on striving for recovery but I also won’t lie so that’s where I’m at, really relying on my support systems and trying my very best to pull myself out of this😩

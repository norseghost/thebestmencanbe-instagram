Not all of us are good at keeping things casual... There’s a lot of pressure now to be able to handle casual relationships. To be able to have ‘fuck buddies’ and not get feelings. Society has separated sex from emotions, and it’s now considered totally normal to have casual sex.

But it’s actually chemically much more likely a woman will get feelings for people they have sex with! This is what happens during sex in our brains: 👩🏼Women - Produce higher levels of oxytocin (nicknamed the cuddle hormone) which increases levels of empathy and connection.
👨Men - Produce higher levels of dopamine (known as the pleasure hormone) which is an addictive surge of simple pleasure.

Everyone is different, regardless of sex. But it is fact women will tend to find it harder to not catch feelings. And that’s ok. It’s not uncool or uptight to prefer serious relationships. Never be ashamed of that 🙌

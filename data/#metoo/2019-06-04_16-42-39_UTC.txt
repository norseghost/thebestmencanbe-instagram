I know how hard benzo Withdrawal is first hand. And I although I never experienced a long taper, because my doctors took me off of the highest legal dose of Valium in less than 4 days, I just want you all to know that You are incredibly strong for being able to taper and you Can do this. I am now on day 179 of benzo withdrawal from Valium. I have survived the withdrawal from Benzodiazepines, Opiates, antidepressants, stimulants, muscle relaxants, diet pills and at least 7 other medications (the benzo being the worst for me) that the doctors had me on and I am still alive and here to help and encourage any of you that may be experiencing these withdrawals. Keep going and keep fighting friends, and just know that you have super human strength for being able to get through this. You’re amazing. 💙🙏🏼💪 .
Much love and healing thoughts to you, 
Shelli

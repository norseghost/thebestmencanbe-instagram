It broke my heart to learn of Ellen’s story today.
I taught sex ed yesterday and naturally the kids were horrified to find out how babies are made. One sweet little girl asked me if any man could ever force her to do that or even touch her. No, you sweet precious girl. NO ONE, man or woman, ever has the right to touch you or gesture toward you in any way you don’t want them to. EVER. PERIOD. And if they do, speak up. It is NOT ok.

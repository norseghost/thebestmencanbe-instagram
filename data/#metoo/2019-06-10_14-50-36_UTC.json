There is no peace for the dozens and dozens of firsthand accounts I have heard personally from women for whom rape is all too commonplace. Who were abused in their homes, by people they trusted. Physically. Psychologically. Emotionally. There is no PEACE in a world that will not reprimand those who have done it.\n\nDoes anyone lack a story of abuse? If you do, do any of you deny that you know AT LEAST one who has suffered for the abuse? And what do we do for it?\n\nSo here\u2019s to them.\nHere\u2019s to those that have been taken advantage of. Drugged. Gotten a little too drunk. Cornered. And raped.\n\nHere\u2019s to those who suffered for years in abuse from a spouse, or a \u201clover,\u201d or a family member.\n\nHere\u2019s to every individual, male and female alike, who have suffered at the hands of true tyranny.\n\nHere\u2019s to the LGBTQ+, who have now surpassed the Jewish community in percentage of hate crimes against them (though the Children of Israel are still not far behind). Here\u2019s to the fact that 80% of rape cases are brought forward by Caucasian women, by that women of color are STILL more commonly assaulted. \nHere\u2019s to a #metoo movement that died down because those in power WANTED it to. \nLeaders of once great nations sit in their seats of power like tyrants in iron thrones. Masses of their followers hide behind the guise of \u201cfree speech\u201d for hate crimes. Should one be prosecuted not only for the crime, but for what was going through their minds when they committed it? \nThis is not the end of it. This is the beginning. To all of you:\n\nYOU ARE NOT ALONE.\n\nIt\u2019s time they realize that.\n\n#rapeculture #abuse #hatecrimes #america #love #metoomovement"

#SexualCoercion (part 2 of 2) || I had every intention of taking that story with me to the grave, but burying it only helped shame take root and become another voice in my mind. Shame said he had gotten me to defile myself without even uttering a word. Shame said I had been an accomplice to the most degrading moment of my life. Shame said no one would ever understand because he hadn‚Äôt forced me to do it against my will. Shame said I could never tell anyone this story.‚Å£

I once read about how people who are abusive see their victims (consciously or subconsciously) as containers in which to dump their own pain, anger, fear and trauma. Why then have I felt ashamed of these stories when I was only the recipient, not the perpetrator, of such vile behaviour? I was ashamed of my compliance, but through educating myself and hearing other people‚Äôs stories @reclaimyourvoice I learned about sexual coercion (slide 2). I came to understand that I actually had ùòØùò∞ùòµ complied so easily. My compliance was the result of the effort he had put into grooming me. My compliance came from the feeling that it wasn‚Äôt safe for me to say no.‚Å£

The first time I shared this story publicly, something unexpected happened: two women reached out to me and thanked me for sharing their story. And this continued to happen each time I shared it. It was always bittersweet: comforting to know that I wasn‚Äôt the only person it had happened to, that others could relate and understand, but equally upsetting for all the same reasons. I shone light on this experience over and over again, and eventually the shame, upon being met with love, began to wither and die. Today this story no longer has power over me. I share it now for everyone who can‚Äôt speak on it yet. I firmly believe we have nothing to be ashamed of and I am happy to stand in that truth.‚Å£

The shame belongs to the perpetrators of abuse.‚Å£
The shame belongs to those who exploit people‚Äôs vulnerabilities.‚Å£
The shame belongs to those who degrade and humiliate others, who use violence to get their needs met.‚Å£

Your heart is godly for wanting to relieve them of it, but the shame you have been carrying is not your burden to bear.

The worst part was the corruption and learning about just how broken our system is and power imbalance that takes place today.\u2022 \u2022\nThe pattern repeated itself.  Shocked? Not me, it is common for this pattern to persist when you have been victimized as a child.  As women, we typically become victims again, and again, and again until our social circle helps us through it.\u2022\n\u2022\nLearning how to identify the patterns of abuse is challenging for us survivors.  Especially after years of mental and emotional abuse in our early childhood development that shamed us to the point of near extinction more than once\u2014we tend to live by feeling like we are burdens if we don\u2019t give enough of ourselves to the other person or the world around us.\u2022\n\u2022\nThe compounding trauma brought me to my knees and I wanted to hang myself like my sister before me, but I didn\u2019t instead I fought for my life and I still rise and choose to live every single day\u2014I also choose life and healing for you as I believe in the power of healing yourself best when we heal in safe, supportive communities with others who are on the journey of recovery and self-growth.\u2022\n\u2022\nToday, on June 1, 2019 I am who I am.  I am where I am on my healing journey and I am blessed to have this incredible four legged angel by my side and all the wonderful people who have never given up on me in my life.\u2022\n\u2022\nTo all those who continue to believe in me and support me\u2014I love you.  To all those who don\u2019t, I love you anyways just kindly stand down and back off\u2014I am healing and very sensitive.\u2022\n\u2022\n#warriors #ptsd #healing #risesisterrise #metoo"

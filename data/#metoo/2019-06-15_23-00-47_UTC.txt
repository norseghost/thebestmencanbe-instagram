We tend to take experiences with others and try to determine—or prove—things about them. We begin to define who they “ARE.” For example, my mom is difficult, my boyfriend is lazy, my dad is clueless. When we determine who others will be, we limit and suffocate them and harm ourselves in the process. #coachrachelsays #beyondsurviving #coaching #metoo #sexualabuse #lgbtq #traumainformed

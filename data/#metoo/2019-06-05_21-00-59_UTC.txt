Today I'm back into an anti light thankfully not a daily ritual but yeah 
a decades-old in-the-cest I would 
vie was the kind 
of c'est la vie that really 
got to an 11-year-old me 
who thought it was only that one time
till that no way! that 
so scary volcanic moment, when 
you actually WEREN'T 
stonewalling the whole 
damn thing: "oh maybe dozen times?" right after that, I had to leave 
shrinklair for downstairs/air and 
yeah yeah, when 
Ancient Secret finally spilled, 
way belated 
maybe 10 years ago, 
your pivot to this 
3rd person style 
mumbogrumble with a 
barely discernible squeak 
of a "sorry" but still 
more like fessing up to 
maybe old piles of unpaid 
traffic tickets, even though 
you were starting to date 
girls back then 
and I barely had pubes, but 
this was NormalSiblingFun right, 
can't I JUST ERASE ?. Ok, listen, I 
hate this too and I don't 
want to end up totally hating 
this poem, so PIVOT 
to my apartment 
and my life both can be quite 
a mess, not just because 
I remain the anointed 
guardian of the dirt and 
shame, but no, of course 
you didn't ruin 
everything! but I degress 
from my intended digression: 
your house and your cars and 
that replica of a bookshelf that 
somehow manages 
to make real books look like 
plastic replicas nifty! Here, 
my dusty books, the 
castles of cobwebs the 
old poems and ancient electric bills 
all in one silly absurd 
mess. Better, 
your central vacuuming house and 
again, is that really 
a bookshelf with real 
books just TRYING TO 
look 
plastic? PIVOT: s'pose 
you pose sez the camera, going 
to catch that all 
may be-been 
there but didn't maybe really 
do that!?central vacuous smile, 
smile! then just got to clear up 
a bunch of 
pesky old parking tickets 
one of these 
days, so there, all
is fair. /mr

Did she / he really just say that?\nMercury and Jupiter are both in their home signs making this paradox of blurting something out and then having to re-think the whole situation, really powerful, a la Moby who has cancelled his tour.\nOn top of the Juno / North Node in Cancer, there is a situation building with Venus in her home sign of Taurus, full of lusciousness (in Natalie\u2019s house of relationships - eek), and getting strong vibes from the old guard of Saturn / Pluto in Capricorn whilst this heavyweight duo deconstruct.\nIt\u2019s like Moby has taken one for the team (and I\u2019m sorry he seemed like a nice guy), but really he just found out that by bigging up, what he thought was some cool moves on a chick, was just downright creepy slimeball.\nAnother one for the #metoo campaign.\nThe patriarchy and these kind of overpowering lack of self-awareness, \u201cgrab their pussies they don\u2019t mind\u201d actions just ain\u2019t going to fly anymore and Venus in Taurus is way too content and self satisfied to let that go.\nThere\u2019s much more to this than I can fit on here, but obviously we want to be in Natalie\u2019s camp for whatever is going down in our own lives, so let go of the structures and formalities and don\u2019t be afraid to call out what you don\u2019t like or don\u2019t want and speak your own truth.\n#natalieportman #moby #mobydick #speakyourtruth #geminiinmercury #venusintaurus #jupiterinsagittarius #jupiterretrograde #plutoincapricorn #saturnincapricorn #creep #saturnplutoconjunction #venusandvesta"

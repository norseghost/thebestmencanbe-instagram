We are working so hard on @thevontramps next moves here at #trampcamp. New announcements soon! I saw this photo and it is so inspiring to me. We are 100% DIY and self funded. Some days, itâ€™s hard when we see losses. But when I see the way little girls watch us play- when I see the business woman on the plane light up when we talk about @joanjett and rock and roll, when #womxn hear the lyrics in our songs and say #metoo; it somehow all becomes worth it no matter the cost and sacrifice.

What a great afternoon meeting with @jason_l_jenkins , Paul Thomas , Franccesca Cesti-Browne and the great team from the Miami Dolphins Football Unites Program. It was a great opportunity to discuss important issues affecting the Hispanic community in Miami Dade County. it was a great discussion regarding domestic violence affecting our most vulnerable populations. @survivorspathwayorganization @florida.health @miamidadehaab @advocacymdc #survivorspathway #latinx #survivorspathway #metoo #humanrights #immigration #advocacy

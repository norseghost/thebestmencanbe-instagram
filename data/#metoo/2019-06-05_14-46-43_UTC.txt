A lot happens in a year...
.
Almost exactly 1 year ago I launched @wrightsactive and since then I’ve done speaking events, participated in women’s retreats, and so much more! I’ve even sold my sports bra internationally to women in the United Kingdom and New Zealand...wait...what!?😱
.
But I can tell you that this journey is not easy and I’m learning every day.
.
I recently was contacted by @lovewhatmatters (millions of followers on Facebook alone) to share my story.
.
My intent is never to sensationalize a sad story. I created @wrightsactive because I wanted to encourage women to live their best, healthiest lives and to spread love and positivity. I want to empower women. And I want to give back to the causes that support women activism.
.
If you’re interested in reading, I’ve linked it in the bio.
Please note: there’s a lot more to the story but in order to not write a novel, some parts were omitted. The important take away is my transformation. I owe it all to my healthy lifestyle and Mother Nature🌲❤️

"Dead Lolitas", digital collage, 2017 ✝ .

For many years, I have been dealing with PTSD- and trauma recovery in my art. At a certain point in (real) therapy, I had to bury my inner "Lolita", the constructed, survival strategy of belittling myself to become attractive to men (well, the wrong kind of men, I myself attracted at the time). So, I killed Lolita. I stopped belittling myself, I stopped pretending to not know things so the men would feel smarter, I stopped playing weak so that the men could feel stronger than me, I stopped gagging myself to enable their cocky mansplaining - and I stopped carrying their shame, their responsibility and expectations. I handed it over to the abusive men -  where it belonged in the first place. It was such a liberating process. ❤

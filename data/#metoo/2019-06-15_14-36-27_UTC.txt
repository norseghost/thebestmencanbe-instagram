Detail of my work « me(a)t Donald Trump », 300X300cm, silicone and coloured polyurethane flexible foam 
A piece of the puzzle. Go into my gallery to see the portrait of #DonaldTrump behind these 23 women who came forward about his sexual misconduct.
Last year, I did one of Weinstein as a metaphor for how he took the beauty of women and made it serve his ugly purpose.

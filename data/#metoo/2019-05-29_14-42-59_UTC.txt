I keep telling these people, accusing someone of Rape Publicly ISN'T expressing an Opinion. It's Falsely Accusing someone of a Crime and these people should be Sued in Civil Court (I'd Personally say Prosecuted, but we do what we can). If you Falsely Accuse me, I will call you out Publicly. 
I may or may not call you out if you say nasty things about me Online. Sometimes I forget I have a huge platform on YouTube and it's unfair to these idiots because someone may Harass them. 
I AM FIRMLY AGAINST ANY FORM OF HARASSMENT! (We are not #antifa, we don't #bully people). This isn't a "Wink, Wink, Nudge" Situation. Do not harass these people.

This is merely to inform the Public the things my people go through every single day, simply for expressing our Political Views. 
Don't believe us? Go read the full thing at: "IWW South Sound General Educational Union" (sound like great people tbh). #muhhatespeech #freespeech #metoo #himtoo #falseaccusation #sad #Trump2020 #patriots #lawsuit

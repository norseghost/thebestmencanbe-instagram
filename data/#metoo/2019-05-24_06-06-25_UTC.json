                        "text": "Take a moment to ask yourself how old your inner child is. How old is your inner child? What does your inner child need? Why are they hurting? What will make them feel better? For a long time nurturing my inner child was coloring and eating chocolate ice cream. At another point in time it was dancing. At another point it was running and playing a game at the park or writing letters. If you can identify how old your inner child is & identify what that inner child needs. You can nurture and give that inner child what is needed to heal from that emotional space/age your stuck at when something triggers you as an adult. \nListening to and communicating with your inner child, whether on paper or an activity that helps you feel good is crucial for healing to occur. Consider writing a letter and telling your  inner child that you recognize him or her and that your intention is to do everything in your power to heal his or her wounds. Answers you need will emerge in some way shape or form!  It\u2019s important to ask your inner child what he or she is feeling and what is needed right now. By maintaining a dialogue with your inner child healing and transformation needed for you to remove barriers getting in the way of moving forward towards your journey to a better self will begin to go away! You\u2019ll be in greater alignment with yourself and your emotional needs and wants as an adult! \nHappy playing & discovering! \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\udc6f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \ud83d\udc9c, AM -\ud83d\udc7d\ud83e\udddc\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. .\n.\n.\n#positivequotes #feminism #metoo  #womenempowerment #women #selflove #relationships  #quotes #mentalhealth #photooftheday #mentalhealthawareness  #healing  #survivor #inspiration #motivation #wellness #sexualabuse #ptsd  #beautiful #life #health  #depression #lifecoach #wellnesscoach #womeninspiringwomen #foodforthought #courage #power #strongwomen #morningmotivation"

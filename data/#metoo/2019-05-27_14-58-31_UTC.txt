A snippet of yesterday's #footstepstoinspire run in Belgrade. #serbia is country 46. I'm running to peacefully end sexual violence in every country of the world.
ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¸ Hvala Serbia! So touched and grateful for the amazing turn out. It was unexpected. I sometimes have to pinch myself as I run side by side with people from such different parts of the world, sharing stories and life experiences, realising how similar we all are. 
My body is feeling a little sore. It's the first 16km since December in Vietnam. .

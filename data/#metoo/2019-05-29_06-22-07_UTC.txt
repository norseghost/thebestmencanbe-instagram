So many amazing women have joined us on Speak Out Sisterhood on Facebook. 
I have opened a FB group called SPEAK out SISTERHOOD.

As someone who has experienced a very negative back lash when telling my story about abuse and my journey publically I have realised that I am not alone in that. Other's feel the same and often have a struggle even acknowledging that they were abused themselves.

I know of other's who are afraid to speak out for fear of retribution and blame but wanted to create a safe, empowering and light filled space for light and power to spread.

It's not a therapy or counselling group , although has signpost link's but is about not feeling alone, worried, odd or anxious. It's about a sense of belonging and being part of a group of survivors who refuse to deny to themselves they have faced abuse, violence or challenges and will not deny it to themselves any longer. 
We are fucking stronger than we knew.

If you know anyone who might want to hop over here's the link.

You can interact, watch or just feel the power.

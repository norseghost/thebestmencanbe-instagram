At F&F our ultimate goal is to escape and Run Away to Safety! But what can you do if you have fallen or have been pushed to to the ground and find yourself on your hands and knees? We need to get into a defensive position where we can SEE the danger and then use the strongest part of our body (our legs!!) to kick kick kick until we can escape and Run Away! These jr high and high school girls just learned this technique! Beautifully done girls!!

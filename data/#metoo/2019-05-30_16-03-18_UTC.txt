“#Republican" has become a synonym for “#hypocrite"...

At long last, #Mueller has spoken… FOR HIMSELF!
Trump (despite the attempted narrative shaping by Bill Barr and his own twisted spin) is STILL not exonerated. 
The case is NOT CLOSED. 
In fact, it’s just being opened [or soon will be] by Congress… as Mueller clearly intended.
But there is no choice. This is beyond partisan politics.
Congress must do what they are constitutionally bound to do — and begin impeachment proceedings.
And we, the public, must do what is morally right… and support removing this man from the presidency. #dirtydonald is below the dignity of the office and profoundly unfit to hold it.
We must keep our eyes open… and not shut our mouths when we see corruption and injustice in plain sight. 
Keep track of those in office who still support the “president” now that the Mueller Report is being made public — and remember them in November, 2020.
Don’t forget…
WE THE PEOPLE have the power. 
WE can #VOTE to end all of this vile insanity and restore normalcy. 
Our country was fooled once. 
In 2020, more than ever, voters will want substance. #Trump will come up empty there. People want candidates who can deal with real issues… not those only capable of creating fake emergencies… The 2018 midterms were a step in the right direction… now we need the #WhiteHouse and Senate in 2020... To save #America we must hold to account the inept, corrupt and amoral unindicted co-conspirator in the oval office, #Individual1: #illegitimate #failingpresident #DonaldTrump.

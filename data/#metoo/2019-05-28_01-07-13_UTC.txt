Some periods of growth are so confusing that we donâ€™t even recognize that growth is happening. We may feel hostile or angry  or weepy or hysterical, or we may feel depressed. It would never occur to us, unless we stumbled upon a book or a person to explain to us, that we are in fact in the process of change, of actually becoming larger, spiritually than we were before.

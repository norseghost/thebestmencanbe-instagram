✨Boys Will Be Held Accountable For Their Actions✨
.
💔 my heart has been so heavy this week... for my sisters finally scraping together the courage to speak out... and for myself not having the courage to speak yet 😞
.
.
I have HUNDREDS of screenshots off twitter, with gut wrenching accounts of rape and sexual assault. From babies who couldn’t walk or talk yet, to the daughters, cousins, sisters, nieces, best friends, girlfriends, wives, and students of these rapists
.
.
too much to post here in these 10 allotments, but I will make a blog post this week with every single one of these why I didn’t report screenshots
.
.
for now, here are statistics and powerful artwork, feel free to repost anything that resonates with you 🙏🏽
.
.
⚠️PLEASE REMEMBER⚠️
.
1. It is not your fault, no matter how you were dressed, if you liked them or were in a relationship with them, no matter how late you were out, no matter how many drinks you had, no matter what anyone says, IT HAS NEVER AND WILL NEVER BE YOUR FAULT
.
2. I believe you, and I will always believe you
.
3. My DMs are open, if you are not ready to publicize your rapists’ crimes, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO, it’s no ones business and I am here for you, you don’t even have to tell me what happened, I’m still here for you sis 🙏🏽

You being drunk and high doesn’t give my consent. You having a turbulent childhood doesn’t give my consent. You “respecting” other women in your life doesn’t give my consent. Me being drunk and high doesn’t give my consent. Me being there doesn’t give my consent. Me wearing shorts doesn’t give my consent. Me saying no over 20 times definitely doesn’t give my consent. Me constantly prying hands off and peeling away doesn’t give my consent. Me pleading for it to stop is not giving my consent. Understand what consent is. Fuck you, fuck you.

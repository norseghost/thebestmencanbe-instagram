Once upon a time there was girl constantly getting mocked and told she would never become anything more than a whores daughter. ⠀
⠀
He would sing “beauty school drop out” in the halls to mock her dreams & spit in her face. ⠀
⠀
The words he would speak eventually became the self talk she would carry.⠀
⠀
The bruises heal but the words are still taunting. ⠀
⠀
But she breathes in the air and as it fills her lungs her heart speaks truths of comfort, resilience, self love and a new voice is made. Steadily the new words resonate and a new story is born. She decides who she is and she decides to thrive. ⠀
⠀
Whatever you’re healing from. You’re beyond beautiful, brave and strong. Do the work. Let what doesn’t serve you go. Decide who you want to be in YOUR story. 💚

Get out a sheet of paper and write down your limiting beliefs about who you are and what you can achieve. This is your game plan, your framework of reaching and going higher. From this point on, your mission is to squelch anything that pulls you down and makes you think you are “less than” or somehow unable to achieve your goals. Use this list as your starting point and don’t look back!

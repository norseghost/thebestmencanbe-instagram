On May 16, I had a chat with a class at Bethel American International School about Human Rights issues in Nigeria and the #SayHerNameNigeria protest in Ibadan.•
•
It was good talking about this pressing and often overlooked issue with younger people, and answering their questions.•
•
This practical approach by their teacher, Ojumu Olalekan, is commendable. Students learn better through out-of-class activities on taught theories & lessons.•
•
I look forward to more engagements like this in institutions and communities, as no sustainable change can happen without them.•

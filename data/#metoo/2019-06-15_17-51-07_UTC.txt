Itâ€™s been 3 years for my baby @theebutterflyproject. 3 years of tears and fears. Walking out on faith and believing God to take ya to higher ground. 3 years of supporting over 300+ women and mailing over 250+ women received survivor packs. 20 women clothed and countless inspired. God has been faithful through it all and for that Iâ€™m eternally grateful. Weâ€™re growing and only going up ðŸ¦‹ðŸ’œ. Thank you to everyone who believes in me so they believe in The Butterfly Project. God, like Hannah, I give my baby back to you and will allow you to complete the good work you began!

Eh like, if you thought #MyBigBreakUpShow was all, and if you thought @museumoftat was all, you’re wrong and wouldn’t understand why I have bags under my eyes you could travel with. (But not on Ryanair as they wouldn’t be small enough for the carry-on allowance). I’m #directing this awesome piece by my ex-student and now friend and collaborator @jessgioiax and we are dealing with how SHIT this industry can be to young actresses. Don’t be like Lola. If you even suspect abuse of any form, WALK. #acting #actors #actorslife #director #directing #producer #producing #metoo #stopabuse #newwriting #casting #CouchCast •

Where you live shouldn’t determine whether you live, yet around the world, almost 20 million babies and children miss out on the basic vaccinations they need every single year. Horrific diseases like measles, polio, and pneumococcal disease can threaten the life of a child, even though we know how to prevent them. 
Children given vaccinations against a swarm of diseases have a better chance at growing up healthily, to perform well in exams at school, and eventually get a job and contribute to their society as an adult. 
Every mother deserves to see her child grow up happy and healthy. And thanks to vaccines, this is reality for more and more people — with more than 10 million lives saved since 2000, and countless children walking who would otherwise have been paralyzed by polio. 
Let’s save more lives, and ensure no child dies because of where they are born.

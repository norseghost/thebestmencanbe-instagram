This picture says everything to me.  My eyes are dead.  Hiding in a bathroom after scoring because I didn’t know how to interact without aggression. 
Full of pain, fear and shame. 
My skin hugging my bones and little bit of muscle I have left like Saran Wrap.
.
It’s straight up a miracle that a series of events landed me back in Utah and I was able find my voice and whisper for help till someone got close enough to hear me. .
My face is nowhere near this dead anymore.  Y’all have helped me let the light back in. So many people dont#’t make it back. I have so many loved ones on my mind lately that I wish would pick up the phone and just call.  No matter how much shame and darkness you feel I promise there IS a way back. .
If you’re scrolling past this and we’re able to sit still long enough to read this shit, fucking reach out.  Pick up the damn phone and take a step for yourself.  We all got you and we all know how it feels.  Just remembering I’m not alone is the only thing that gets me by some nights.  Let’s do this. We got you. .

God described the narcissistic sociopath in the Bible. How do you win against him? With the help of God. Cast your cares on the Lord. He doesn’t want you to stay oppressed. God will sustain you, but you must move your feet. God moves with us, not for us. The time to get away is now. Speak up. Get away. Stay away. Praying God’s strength in and through you as you get away. No weapon formed against you will prosper. #noweapon #lovegod #loveyourkids #beblessed #domesticviolencesurvivor #speakup #getaway #stayaway #domesticviolenceawareness #metoo

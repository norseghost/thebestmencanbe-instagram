It’s been brought to my attention that someone has plagiarized Blessed Be The Brains on Amazon and started to sell under the shop name “Blessed Be The Brains shirt” anything from this seller IS NOT AFFILIATED OR APART OF THE BLESSED BE THE BRAINS SHOP. They are selling shirts for $17.99 and NOT donating the money to charity. Right now they only have “I was not made to be subtle” shirts but please be aware and DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!! Plus, their font choice for the shirt is an ugly bubble font AND THERE’S A TYPO 👋🏻

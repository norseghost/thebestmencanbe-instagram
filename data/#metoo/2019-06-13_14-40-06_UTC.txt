One of the biggest and most confusing questions in my life has been, "Who am I?" Over the years I have been many things, in an attempt to recreate myself into someone "acceptable". I struggled for years with anorexia in order to be "thin enough", I allowed people in all aspects of my life to be abusive to me, hoping I could "earn" their love and acceptance, I have put on false faces so that no one could see the pain and despair, hoping others would think I was "normal"...
.
These days, I make no pretense, I tolerate no nonsense, I walk away from abusive people and never look back... I'm still uncertain of who I really am, but I have learned who I am NOT. That is, at least, a beginning.

A simple reminder today considering the current polarity an state women's rights being threatened. .
.
For men, I read this recently & it hit home for me. I believe Tupac Shakur wrote this
.
. "Since we all came from a woman,
got our name from a woman,
plus our game from a woman,
I wonder why we take from our women,
why we rape our women,
Do we hate our women?

I think it's time we killed for our women,
be real to our women,
try to heal our women,
cuz if we don't, 
we'll have a race of babes
that will hate the ladies 
that make the babies

And since a man can't make one,
he has NO RIGHT to tell a woman when and where to create one"

I am here to guide you on your path. Book a session with me & discover the magic within you buried in the depths of your own shadows and step into your power fully.

Please join us Sunday, 6/9 for our next women's #retreat & journey into self discovery in a community of sisterhood.

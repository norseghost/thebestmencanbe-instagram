Every Morning, I affirm to myself all my dreams.
...
Blogging is my birthright.
Traveling is my birthright.
Learning something new every day is my birthright.
Becoming a millionaire is my birthright.
And so on...
Affirm your dreams EVERYDAY. Say it out loud proudly. Honour your abilities, be grateful for the right opportunities coming up in your life, and things will start unfolding easily!! 💜🌈🤞🤗🌼

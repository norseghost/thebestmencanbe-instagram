“My husband was away for the weekend. I rarely feel unsafe in my home, except for when my husband is away. A creeping unsettling feeling inevitably sets in as night approaches. This time I tried to shake it off, “Everything will be fine” I told myself. I was almost home from the grocery store and realized I desperately needed gas. The closest gas station to our home has a bad reputation. It’s a minit mart nicknamed the “murder mart”. In the year since moving into our home I have avoided that gas station and have never been inside. Again I told myself, “Everything will be fine. You need gas, it’s the closest one”. I pulled up to the pump and about a minute into pumping gas, it happened. “Damn baby I thank God for women like you everyday. God bless you *man grunt noises*”. I didn’t know what to do. My face blushed from uncomfortableness. I avoided eye contact. I finished pumping gas, got back in my car, and drove the 5 blocks to my house. I berated myself for not planning ahead and getting gas somewhere else. For wearing my gym leggings in public. As if the location or my clothes are the issues that need addressed. That night I triple checked that all my doors were locked and barricaded the basement door with kitchen chairs.” - @sydafink

Joining us for the Universal Foundation for Better Livingâ€™s, Panorama of Truth Conference, is Clinical Psychologist, Dr. Joan Muir.

She will equip us with strategies that support others and ourselves to positively address issues surrounding the #MeTOO Movement.  This will be a lively session as many persons question the role ministries should play in helping persons (the offender and the offended) to heal. 
I truly am grateful that Dr. Muir will be joining us. All are welcome to register at www.ufbl.org  Join us as we all heal!

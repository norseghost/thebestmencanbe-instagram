Looking back a year ago or even just a few months ago I have grown so much. 
From living as a victim to stepping into VICTORY. I have seen many people talk about how they are so much happier now than they used to be which is great but I want to share with you a message that is a bit different. .
.
You are NOT going to wake up one day and decide to be happy. You are NOT going to wake up and decide to just detach yourself from everything that has ever been said or done to you. We are human we have memories & we have built up walls. No one, no man/woman, family member, friend or therapist can break down your wall. This is something you have to do for yourself. Little by little day by day living in self awareness you WILL be able to free yourself from the cell you have been living in. There are going to be days that you will feel like none of this is working, you are lost, confused, and wanting to go back to old habits. .
LISTEN ... THAT IS SELF DOUBT! It does not come from your own belief of yourself but of your constant comparison to others and believing the things youâ€™ve heard said about you or to you. Do NOT allow those people to control your life. You are in control of the life you wish to live. So if you want to be happy, grow, and live free you have to work on it constantly and every second of your life. 
When will you decide to no longer be a victim?

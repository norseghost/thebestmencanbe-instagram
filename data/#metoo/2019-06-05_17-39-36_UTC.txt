Last night I went to see rock critic Jim DeRogatis in a wonderful conversation with #MeToo founder Tarana Burke and writer Jamilah Lemieux about his book Soulless which talks about R.Kelly and his horrific antics. Worth streaming on the thegreenespace.org website (I ask a question at 1.27!). On Today’s Sitting With Gianluca I’ll be playing a woman singing about killing her rapist with a broken bottle and a few songs by the great and dignified brave Hazel Dickens who just had a bridge in West Virginia names after her.

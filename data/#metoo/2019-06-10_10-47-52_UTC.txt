Imagine a hypothetical situation ‚Äì the sun sets and it gets dark outside. But unlike other days, men have to stay indoors because they have a deadline. What would women, non-binary people and gender nonconforming folks do? Could they go out without any fear? 
A civil rights activist, Danielle Muscato, asked this question on Twitter. And the responses are chilling and insightful. Especially in the #MeToo era. The reaction to this viral tweet highlight how the fear of being assaulted is universal; irrespective of which part of the world you live in. Especially at night, it‚Äôs a fear and anxiety which most women have internalised. The replies were about simple things like going out for a run at night or having the chance to go for a hike without worrying about being in danger. Another user acknowledged that he never thought his freedom was a gender privilege before reading the Twitter thread. Last night we hosted our first sunset Headphones N‚Äô Hike Adventure in the Wicklow Mountains. We want women to experience the outdoors whether it be solo or at night and feel confident and safe when doing so. We have linked the Twitter thread in our bio if you care to read a little more about it üëç #confidencetoconquer #galzgonewild #ggwtribe #hikingadventures #outdooradventures #womenwholead #ireland #hiking #outdoors #explore #wicklow #53degreesnorth

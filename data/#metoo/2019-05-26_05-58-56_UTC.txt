Rp @lodilightning Scared little babies.. afraid of what will next.. They've given up.. These smart and kind animals have lived their entire lives in the dark, in pain, in their feces, in cages, afraid, in hell. Only to end up being gassed and murdered for someone's taste.. These babies don't want to die, they don't deserve to die.. You don't need to eat them, being vegan is the easiest choice I've ever made. Why do you still chose to have these beautiful, sweet animals murdered for you? Just because you pay someone to do it doesn't mean that the blood isn't on your hands. These animals are living in hell and being brutally murdered for your 5minutes of taste.. üíî I'm so sorry my babies, I'm so sorry that we couldn't do more. I'm so sorry that you never got to play, never got to be held, never got to run around in the grass.. I'm so sorry.. I'll never forget you, I'll never forget what they did to you.. You mattered, to me, to us. I'll never stop fighting for you‚ù§ rest in peace my loves.. I love you I love you I love you..‚ù§ #govegan #pig #pigs #babypig #piggie #baconlover #littlepiggie #pigsofig #pigsofinstagram #misspiggy #teacup #piglets #pigstagram #minipig #piglife #piglove #puerco #blt #poorbaby #potbellypig #skinnypig #ham #burrito #babybackribs #vegano #metoo #seperation #donttakeourplanetforgranted

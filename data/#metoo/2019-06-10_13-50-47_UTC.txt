We are so excited to share our June Issue of @eleanora_magazine, featuring @mindy_benson, President of @newrepublicstudiosâ€”inspired by the legacy of Early Hollywood pioneer Lois Weber. It always takes a village of people and ideas to make these stories come to life. Several months ago, @jenmorrisonlive shared Lois Weberâ€™s story with me. After researching her career and being surprised to find that although her creative leadership during the silent film era was instrumental in building Hollywood and pushing the boundaries of cinema, Lois Weberâ€™s name was just sort of written out of Hollywoodâ€™s history. Lois Weber was the first person to direct a feature length silent film. She made more films than Charlie Chaplin, who was a peer during her time. Her dedicated advocacy work for women in the film industry ensured leadership positions were given to her peers both behind and in front of the camera. But when the 1920s came along, Hollywoodâ€™s culture changed. It has taken 100 years for Loisâ€™s story to re-make headlines, now that we are in the age of #MeToo and #TimesUp. As a parallel to Lois Weberâ€™s story of the past, we chose to feature the story of Mindy Raymond in the present, and the legacy she is building through her work to bring more film, television and content production to Texas. To us, she represents what a modern-day industry pioneer looks like, working towards a grand vision on a creative campus thatâ€™s off the beaten bath, drawing Hollywood A-listers to YouTubers to tech entrepreneurs and everyone in between. She is an extremely special person who is using her leadership position to do amazing things. As a nod to the moving picture era, we made a mini moving cover story to illustrate a day with Mindy: Life On Her Lot. Enjoy the issue at the link in my bio! Thank you to everyone whose ideas and talents and inspired creativity helped make this issue happen!! ðŸŽ¬ Photography by @wendybowman_ Art Direction by @melissa__delgadillo BTS work by @newrepublicstudios. #eleanoramagazine #juneissue #womeninfilm #womendirectors #loisweber #earlyhollywood #inspiredbyhistory #movingpictures #silentfilmera

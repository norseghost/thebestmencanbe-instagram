Here’s a poster I made for a Speak Out this past semester. It has rape stats up and down. But the reason I made this post is because the popsockets i made have already made $26 together!!!! It’s not a lot but the proceeds are going to the Wildlife Conservation Network and the Youth Ocean Conservation Summit. And that’s just really cool. The link for the save the oceans pop socket is in my bio!!! If you want the save the bees one please lmk!!!!

i haven’t really mentioned this too much to the two people i have told about my rape but i can’t stop thinking about how i froze. i know whenever you’re faced with a dangerous/ scary situation you’ll either fight, flight, or freeze. when it was first starting i tried to fight. but the more it escalated i suddenly froze. i don’t know if he took that as it was okay to continue but it definitely wasn’t. as i previously kept trying to push him off of me i kept telling him no and that he shouldn’t be doing this and that he was just trying to take advantage of me because i was drunk. that means to stop. but he didn’t. i thought i could trust him. and when i froze i just kept thinking about how badly i just wanted to be somewhere else. i just wanted to go home and be in my warm bed and fall asleep with no thoughts in my mind. i wanted him off me. but i was frozen and my brain tried to take me as far away as it could from what was happening to my body. i felt like i just shut down. i remember how removed i felt from everything that was happening. i wanted to die. and those same thoughts keep running through my head as when i froze. how i just want to stop thinking. how i want to go far far away. how i want to die. and i’m mad at myself for freezing. i’m mad at myself for not being able to fight more. i’m mad at myself for failing to protect my body.

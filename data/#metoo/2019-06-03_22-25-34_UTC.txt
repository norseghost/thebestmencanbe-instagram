Facing the often hard truth of “what is” will test your resilience like no other. It will test how you deal with fear with shame with vulnerability and can alter your beliefs and patterns. The first step is acknowledging your being targeted. Remember the first time you jumped off the edge of the pool? You were afraid right? But you did it anyway. So be afraid and do it anyway - that’s stepping outside of the territory, because the map, your map (what you see), is not the territory (reality).

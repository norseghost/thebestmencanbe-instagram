Jodi Picoult does not disappoint in this legal drama! Picoult’s books are always heavy, but extremely entertaining and revolve around legal court cases. She’s an author that every reader must try once, and you’ll for sure be hooked! This book in particular mixes religion(witchcraft) with a rape allegation all within a small town. This book is especially relevant with the current #metoo movement, offering a different perspective. Add this one to your summer reading list!  I highly recommend!

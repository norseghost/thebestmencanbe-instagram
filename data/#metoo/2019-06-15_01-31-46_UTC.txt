Need to know about the Sudan conflict:

On April 11, change came to Sudan. After months of protest reportedly triggered by cash and bread shortages, Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled the country for the last 30 years despite indictments for war crimes and genocide in Darfur, was overthrown by the citizens of Sudan who were tired of living in a dictatorship.

Military leaders moved in, but initially claimed they agreed to civilian rule, developing a reported plan to rotate power between the civilians and military leaders. However, the talks dissolved. The pro-democracy movement, led by the Sudanese Professionals Association, wants civilian rule and a long period of transition before new elections are held to prepare for voting, while the military leaders reportedly want voting to take place in nine months.

As the military tightened its hold on the supposedly transitional government it had formed, the civilians staged a strike. On June 3, that non-violent protest proved too much for the military, which staged a violent response, killing AT LEAST 120 peaceful protesters and SERIOUSLY INJURING over 700 more, today AT LEAST 70 rape victims are confirmed!!! Civilian reports have put the death count at much more and have said dozens of bodies were dumped into the Nile River. To prevent reporting their victims from reporting the crimes or asking for help from the global community, the military has SHUT DOWN THE INTERNET NATIONWIDE. Thats why it’s so important for us to spread awareness for the ones who can’t!! Following the killings, the SPA called for “complete civil disobedience and open political strike.” As people flee the violence, a new refugee crisis is shaping up.

You who care and shout #BlackLivesMatter every chance you get and you who talk about #MeToo and your white feminism every chance you get! Remember these people, those who risk their lives everyday in Sudan in the hope of a better life.  Many have died in recent days, more have been tortured by the corrupt Sudanese government. Care about these black lives! Care about these women! ~

A story showing that we need to check up on our friends. Ask them if they are ok. You never know what is happening inside someone else head until you ask. “Got very drunk on a night out, not intentionally, I guess not uncommon at uni. Next thing I know we were just walking through the street from the club, then I woke up next to him in bed in the morning. He woke up and got on top of me and was about to do it and I said ‘no sorry I don’t want to’. He looked embarrassed and I said I was busy and that he had to leave. He then stalked and messaged me on fb the same day. I felt guilty because I couldn’t control what happened that night. I thought it was my fault for drinking. My friends joked as I had hickys on my neck. ‘Must have been a good night’ they said. I just kept quiet. I think back to vague memories of us making out that night, thinking did we actually do it? I find out that he told a mutual friend about it all and apparently so.” #ournakedtruth #speakout #metoo #universitysexualassault #prochoice #sexualassault #brave #fightback #speakup #nomeansno #standtogether #anonymousconfessions #help #justice #rape

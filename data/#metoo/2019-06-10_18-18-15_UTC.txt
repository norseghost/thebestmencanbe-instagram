Last night my friend and client @cdogg22 saw @famoustheplay for a second time. He was so moved by the show and the performances, which were inspired by his memoir #coreography. I am so glad I had the chance to see this powerful show and the important discussion that brave victims #coreyfeldman and @ddbambikiller participated in immediately following. Also glad we were able to share this experience with friends @keithcoogan @jason_james_richter @pinkylovejoycoogan @courtanne89. If you are in #la I strongly suggest you see this. #Kids2 #men2 #metoo. Thanks to director @michaelleoni1111 and @sarahfindlay and @arblack16 for taking such great care of Corey and his guests. Also to the entire cast for being so awesome. Ok, I sound like Iâ€™m accepting an award now, but especially having known #coreyhaim and working so closely with Feldman, this really resonated with me and I can see why he felt so strongly about it. @jagentpr

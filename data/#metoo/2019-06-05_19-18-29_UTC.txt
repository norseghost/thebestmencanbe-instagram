This is a post by ‘batmanisagatewaydrug’, saying: “Listen if You think someone is cool and dig their energy You just have to tell them, because that’s the kind of stuff You remember a thousand times longer than somebody complementing your hair or whatever. Tonight I told a girl from my theory class that I like her analytical approach and she bounced back at me saying she digs my feminine energy and how she gets the vibe that, to my core, I exist to uplist women and I damn near cried. Tell people what resonates about them. Be real. Help each other feel seen.”

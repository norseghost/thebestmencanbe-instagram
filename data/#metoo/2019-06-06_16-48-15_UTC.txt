Holy smokes! It’s tomorrow and it feels so good! Today already (and it is early in the day) a lot of emotions have been flying around inside of me. Excitement for what so many have helped create making Yōso what it is and honoring them. Excitement to honor such a beautiful program that supports so many who have been through horrible traumas. 
A little bit of nerves are flying around, will people show up, ya they will, but the feeling is there. A little bit of nerves of if I will be distracted enough with all the go-go-go or will I start crying for so many reasons. 
Whatever happens, it will be just perfect. It will be a special day. 
We have worked so hard and through so much this past year and it is just the beginning of some really amazing big things!

An amazing event put together by Youth Ambassadors @iamwomankind -- shared is some beautiful artwork from the event! "This year's Youth Ambassadors of Womankind have collaborated to host a night of poetry, art, and music to honor the stories of survivors and allies from historically marginalized backgrounds. The event will be a space for survivors, activists, and allies to build a sense of community and empowerment in the wake of the #MeToo movement."

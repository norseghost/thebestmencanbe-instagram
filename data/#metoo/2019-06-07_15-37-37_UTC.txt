. This is 25 . 
Normally I don’t attach a long statement to any of my posts. I never dive deep into any personal details of my life and just focus on showing happy or meaningful  moments through photographs. Today I turn 25. Today is a hard day, a happy day, an emotional day. The past two years have been some of the most challenging for me. I have such an incredible tribe of friends and family who have stood by my side through all the intense highs and lows that life tends to bring. At times I didn’t know if I would make it to this day. With the current chaos this world seems to be in, the subject of abortion, rape, and woman’s rights in general has been so present in my life and on my mind. There are so many incredibly brave woman who have come forward to share their deeply personal experiences. So many have influenced me to stand up and speak out. I am not defined by others actions, prejudice, or hatered. I am still standing today because of the love and support of my family and friends and encouraged to stay strong and to speak out because of all the brave woman who have shared their truths. #metoo
I want to spend this year, my 25th year,  speaking my truth, sharing my journey and struggles in hopes that I can help someone else. 
Maybe this is a moment of growth. 
These thoughts and feelings from this trauma live within me and will always be a part of who I am, but will no longer define me.

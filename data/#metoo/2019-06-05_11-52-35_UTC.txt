....here I am posting about this #indie again. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Words by producer extraordinaire:  @elle_dee_elle “We are proud to be invited to the Women's International Film & Arts festival, New York, NY June 6-9 2019. ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
Once There Was A Winter is a timely and relevant story that is a must see in this current political and social climate of #metoo , and a part of the tidal wave of intersectional feminism CRITICAL for active change.” 🚨 Ticket info in bio.⠀⠀
Please come out on Saturday if you can! ⠀⠀

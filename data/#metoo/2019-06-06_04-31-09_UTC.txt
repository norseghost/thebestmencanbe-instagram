Sometimes we feel as though our life is veering down the wrong path. Things don’t work out the way we believed they would. Something bad happens to someone we love, or someone we thought would never hurt us, does. Or we think we should be a certain somewhere by now.

Gabby Bernstein says ‘obstacles are detours in the right direction’. It can feel like we are living one detour after another. How different would life be if we looked at the ‘detours’ from a higher perspective? That on a soul level we actually chose the detour or some force higher than us did for our own good and the good of those around us?

Eckhart Tolle says ‘how do you know this is the experience you need? Because this is the experience you are having’. Rather than fighting or resisting the detour if we choose acceptance, our suffering begins to alleviate. We can still seek to change something if we wish but our actions will be from a place of peaceful non grasping.....

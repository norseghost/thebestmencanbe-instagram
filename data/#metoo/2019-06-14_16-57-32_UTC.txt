Today women in Switzerland are striking for #genderequality, #feminism and #equalpay. ————————
My son and I joined them to strike for a better society for girls but also for him. I want him to grow up in a world where boys and men are not restricted to masculine norms but free to be who they want. Where we don’t value use of force and weapons as “strong” and “rational”, while think diplomacy, negotiations and compromises are “weak” and “irrational”. (And of course we’re striking for Switzerland to sign the #nuclearban treaty - its a feminist issue!)

An equal society is stronger, safer and better for all! 💪🏽✊🏽

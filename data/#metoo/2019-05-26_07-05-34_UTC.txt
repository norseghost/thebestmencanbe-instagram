Hello everyone!

After Delhi, we are organizing the session of ‘Your Voice Matters’ –Understanding touch and sexual abuse in Bangalore very soon. It is going to be a panel discussion which can help us understand better what sexual abuse is, the myths and facts around sexual assault and what can be done if we have ever experienced sexual abuse or uncomfortable touches. It is high time to break the silence and talk about it, understand it. 
People are often confused whether they actually have been a victim of sexual harassment/abuse or not. Even if they do realize, most of them end up being mute victims because of their fears, unsaid societal pressure and lack of understanding. 
The issue of Sexual abuse violence in India is creeping up the policy agenda but substantial data proves that 99% of cases of sexual violence go unreported. Understanding the issues of sexual violence, safe/ unsafe touch, other crimes and reporting them are critical to generating sustainable solutions to the problem. Hence, this session.

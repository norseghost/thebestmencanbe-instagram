Indian parents must teach their sons to respect girls and should never tell them that boys are superior to the girls, it gives them the thought that they can do anything they want to.... society must learn to respect women.....they are the one who gave birth to us....thus atleast try to give them equity and equality as that is the only thing they ask for...

Today was a day! Wow 😮 First gotta love when there is a line for Attorneys and when I get to the front the “officer” asks if I’m an attorney. Probably because I’m dressed like a bum today, or most likely the stupid hipster haircut. Later when “negotiating” with a prosecutor asking her to work with me in a fine for a single mother she yells in the middle of the courtroom “men have to learn that when a woman says no it means no”. I think I was accused of #metoo today 😕 she also accused another attorney of “sua sponte” communications for contacting the court to get a motion removed from the calendar. This is why we should not use Latin in courts #englishonly 🤣 #exparte Good news is that I got a consent bond for my client and he’ll be home tonight. People please please please don’t miss court. It’s a felony! Check your mail!!! Now off to beautiful Henry Co. I hope my 🧦 don’t have holes 🤦🏽‍♂️ #Teshneh💦 @parastlaw 🏛🏫🇺🇸 #oilspill #BADWOLF #TARDIS

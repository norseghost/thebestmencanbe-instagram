* Task of 21st May
* Mrs India Worldwide
* United For Equality
* Women's are abused & assaulted but so are  Men !!!!
* Encouraging people to support the victims

They show us that they are fine but the reality is sometimes different. We have to make the men around us understand that they will not look weak if they show us what they are going through.....
Men who have been harassed are more likely to experience Heart attacks , Anxiety , Depression.... This affects their  education and employment problems, such as dropping out of school, quitting business , work and low morale.... It seems that different type of harassment is an issue that impacts both men and women . 
The #MeToo movement has been very successful in helping women find their voice on this issue, maybe now itâ€™s time  more men found their voice. 
For this we all have to understand that communication is very important and we have to encourage our men to communicate with us without any hesitation and stop building pressure within themselves thinking that they are being strong by doing so.

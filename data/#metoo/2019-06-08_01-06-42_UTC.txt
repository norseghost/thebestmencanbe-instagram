"Don't be hard on yourself, things take time. Things take time!! Great things take time. PLEASE don't compare yourself to anyone else. We have IG now and you really need to remember that what you see from people is after the tears (sometimes during), amidst heartbreak, depression and failure. We are all going through the same things in different ways I promise. Follow YOUR heart. When God gives you a vision, he gives it to YOU. Not anyone else. You don't need advice or permission. Just your vision and courage! Enjoy where you are. We want to be millionaires, married, travel and do all of these things but be happy where you are too. Each day is so much more a part of your grand story then you think. ALL that you do counts. Have fun. Make fun a priority!"ðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒCheck out this Badass Babes on our website today.

Today I wore a skirt that fell below my knees. I was standing at a Redbox machine and while I browsing I saw a man come up behind me. I thought nothing of it just that he was waiting his turn. He briskly walked away still didn’t think anything of it I got Back to my car which was parked in front of the red box machine To see my moms face blood red  she proceed to tell me that man had  snuck his phone under my skirt to snap a photo.  He didn’t touch me or anything so I had no idea he had done it I’m embarrassed,ashamed and Angry but I’m sharing this to raise my voice that this is just as unacceptable as touching without consent. It kills me to know a part of my body I keep to myself is on a strangers phone  which was probably sent to others. We called the police but it was too late he had gotten away. I want him and all other perverts to rot in hell for the pain they have caused #myclothesarenotmyconsent #metoo #fuckperverts

After a sexual scandal bringing together 18 testimonies of women, we are witnessing today the dismantling of an institution that has set aside what should have been its priority: the dignity of woman. The verdict today is that the Swedish Academy lay on too archaic structures to survive the modern values of Swedish society, where #metoo campaigns have sparked not only a movement, but a revolution. The resignation of Sara Danius proves it and allows us to, rather than despair, adopt all her strength and modernity to admire all this tumult because it is coming from something healthy: the awakening of consciousness.

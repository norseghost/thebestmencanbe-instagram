Her commitment to build schools in areas where rape and abduction is highly prevalent should be recognized. In Ethiopia, 40 percent of girls  are married before the age of 18 and 14 percent of girls are married before the age of 15. Being married at young age, Ethiopian girls become vulnerable to sexual abuse and complications during child birth. Understanding education is a weapon which can be used to prove sexual harassment is a crime, instead of a tradition, First Lady Zinash Tayachew is committed to build schools in areas where rape and abduction is highly prevalent. So far, the  First Lady is dedicated to build more than 100 schools. The increase of education can cause women to be less affected by sexual harassment. Similarly, the presence of education in rural areas can contribute to sexual harassment victims standing up for their rights, while providing platform for sexual harassment survivors to read and create laws that can prevent sexual harassment from happening again. Education has the capacity to make Ethiopia an economic powerhouse. And, that can cause women to control their life and prevent them from entering an abusive relationship. The First Lady\u2018s passion to build schools in remote villages can help Ethiopians\u2019s outlook on traditions that are considered sexual harassment.

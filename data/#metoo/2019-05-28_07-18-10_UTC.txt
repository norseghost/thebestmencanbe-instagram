Iâ€™ve always been incredibly passionate and concerned about social causes around the world, but Iâ€™ve always felt that I wasnâ€™t educated enough, well-informed or qualified to share my opinion in such a public space. Living in Australia I have the privilege to not be affected by a lot of injustices, many would say itâ€™s not my place to care. 
Screw that! The world is burning and people are suffering and those in power donâ€™t care! I want to share my views and have open discussions and contribute to making the world a better and safer place to live 
This is me checking my privilege and using it to give voices to those who donâ€™t have one! NM ðŸŒ¿

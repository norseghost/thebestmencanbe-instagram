One Part RAMONES, one part AC/DC, add in a little GUNS'n'ROSES and a dash of STEEL PANTHER!\n\nTracklist:\n1. Drink This Party Dry\n2. I'm Not In Love\n3. Anal Annie\n4. Spray My Love\n5. The Finger\n6. Attention Whore\n7. One More For The Road\n8. Let's Fuck\n9. GFY\n10. Get My Hole\n11. JaegerBomb\n12. #MeToo\n\nLoud-Stuff states \"Any band who have got the guts to call themselves Thunderfuck and the Deadly Romantics are ok in my books! What you've got here is a band who can play, understand their songs, but have set out with a mission to bring old school, dirty, sleazy rock and roll back to the forefront of things \u2013 and it's worked.\"\nOriginating from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, with a 10 year stint in the UK, the band is an example of how modern day rock and roll is created. With members now permanently located in Canada, shows are moments to be celebrated.\nTHUNDERFUCK & THE DEADLY ROMANTICS is:\nThunderfuck - Vocals\nJohnny Douchebag - Guitars\nJim McPain - Guitars\nRyan C\u00fcmsock - Bass\nGeorge Kaloxilos - Drums \"Real sleaze rock with punk attitude and 80s metal guitars ; Thunderfuck and the Deadly Romantics sound like they have been on a Jack Daniel's diet for a few years!\" states Veglam, \"A bit of WRATHCHILD (UK), ROGUE MALE & MENTORS, these guys seem to know a lot about dirty, debauchery rock'n'roll/punk metal. Bikers, punks and bad girls can party together again!\"\nAll About The Rock says; \"Sonically this band will knock your socks off. Thunderfuckhimself, who is an absolute minotaur of a man, has a stage persona that reminds me of GG ALLIN. Albeit without the nakedness, shitting on stage or punching the audience but he does have that air of danger which has been missing from Rock n Roll since the Sex Pistols.. #pressagent #rockngrowl"

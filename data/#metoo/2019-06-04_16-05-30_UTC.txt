It is the only criminal case to be brought against the two-time Oscar winner, amid a flurry of sexual misconduct allegations. His accuser was 18 at the time of the alleged incident in 2016 and worked as a busboy at the Club Car, a restaurant and bar on Nantucket. According to Spacey's team, the two engaged in nothing more than "consensual flirtation" during their meeting - have questioned the accuser why he did not object or try to move away if he was being assaulted.

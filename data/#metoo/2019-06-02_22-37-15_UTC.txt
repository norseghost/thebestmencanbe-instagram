Fam, friends, colleagues, I will be in Vancouver, at Women Deliver, for the next couple of days, representing SOS Children's Villages and @yes4humanity . Will be live-tweeting some quotes, my feels, opinions and major Shout/Outs to some of the trailblazing activists and change makers present! You best believe I won't hold back on the feels when (read: if) I spot my 'very good friend" @justinpjtrudeau and Her Majesty the Queen (read: Founder of #MeToo) @taranajaneen . ðŸ¤— If you wish to virtually bear witness to any ot this, follow me on Twitter @DUsabase #WD2019 #ThePowerOf #TheNowGeneration #YES4HUMANITY #SOSCelebrates

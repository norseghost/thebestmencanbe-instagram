#100daysofhappy day 25! Lovely morning walk with Rufus, laburnums in full bloom and so pretty...but deadly...so dont casually eat the pods! Last day of dinosaurs in L1, so donned my ranger uniform for the last time (totes want to keep the hat!ðŸ˜‚). Met Mr Spesh and went for dinner at @bakchich_ on a whim and tried their vegan burger. Pretty damn good! Then went on to see @danielsloss at @epsteintheatre. He was fantastic! Was not expecting the ending on #metoo movement and toxic masculinity but much applause given, hit the nail on the head! Thsnks @rosswilliam1988 for the tickets! Also saw @4ofina and Krill further down on our row so was great to catch up afterwards :)

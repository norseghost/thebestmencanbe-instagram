It’s not always appropriate to be a non-confrontational “Nice Girl” like many of us, especially women, have been programmed to be. Sometimes it is completely appropriate or necessary for our safety that we remain silent or flee a situation to avoid physical harm. AT OTHER TIMES IT’S NECESSARY to BE FIERCE and CONFRONTATIONAL. A Fierce, Grounded Woman is a force to be reckoned with when she advocates for her own needs, values, loved ones, human rights, boundaries around other’s behavior, including treatment of her self, loved ones, strangers, animals, and the planet: Mother Earth. Same for a fierce & simultaneously grounded man. The Skill is to practice both Simultaneously. I help people do that. Most of my clients are Women, who I empower with skills like these to get their needs met, set appropuate boundaries in relationships, and go out and make a difference on this planet.~Zia Sunseri, Medicine Woman and Licensed Therapist In person and Video Sessions.

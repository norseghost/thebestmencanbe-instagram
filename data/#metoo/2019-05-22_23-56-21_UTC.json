Is it not hard enough that we have endured hell on earth but now you are asking us to talk our way out of it not being our fault? Abusers are master manipulators. There were so many reasons I stayed so long, love was never one of them. And then after I finally left I learned a truth I'd never heard in my entire life... a victim's most dangerous time is AFTER they leave. That was certainly true in our case. Yes I had a protective order and no it didn't protect us. I did everything I was supposed to do and still came close to very bad things happening. Ignorant people said \"he's the father/husband he won't hurt them. Um... have you turned on the news lately? He's actually more likely to hurt us than a complete stranger. #wakeup #endthesilence #chooselove"

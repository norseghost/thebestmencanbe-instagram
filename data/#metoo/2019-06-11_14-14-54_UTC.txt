Goodbye Life
Poem by: Kile C. Pike

.
Tears will never come to my aide.

There's an amount of pain 
that I can never wash away.

I now search for the trust that I misplaced.
.
.
.
Is there a reason for my aches?

Do the slits on my wrists 
ignite a state of bliss

so that can forget I was ever raped? .
.
.
My husband has a gun. I don't feel secure.

I spend my nights sobbing on the bathroom floor.

He spends his nights out with whores.

I tell my blades that I can't do this any more.
.
.
.
I don't want to live, I want to die.

I don't want to love. I want to cry

but the tears won't flow; somehow my eyes are dry.

I guess warm blood on my fingertips will suffice.
.
.
.
Good night Life.

I'll follow suit with my husband

and live an eternal night life.

Good night Life.

My happiness wasn't free.

Probably a state of no feelings is the right price.

Itâ€™s another public holiday again today and you may be tempted to start doing all the chores that you didnâ€™t complete on Saturday. Just stop already. Seriously take today off, like everybody else. Every free day you get is not a chore day. Take time to sit back and relax and enjoy the moment. Use today to give your children the treat you couldnâ€™t give them because of their one sided childrenâ€™s day holiday. Just do anything that rejuvenates you. ANYTHING but chores. 
So what plans do you have today and please donâ€™t tell me chores ðŸ˜‚

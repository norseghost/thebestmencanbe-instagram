Please re-share this post with your followers, as it is an updated list based on feedback from activists I trust.

I’m learning that one of the most valuable/vulnerable parts of public activism is that it opens us up to accountability around the resources we share.  Thank you to those who reached out to let me know about Erika Lust’s problematic behavior and lack of accountability about this behavior.  Thank you to @justice4sexualassault for sharing your first hand experience with assault and to @whatsmybodydoing for making me aware of Rooster’s experiences.

Also thank you to @darknsoulless for providing information about allegations made against Courtney Trouble for copying the work of BIPOC folks without proper payment and credit.  This list will continue to be edited as I learn more.

Link to Rooster’s video about Erika in bio.

‘Us Too? Bullying and Sexual Harassment in the Legal Profession’ ? Yes, and the numbers are staggering: sexual harassment affects 1 in 3 women & 1 in 14 men; bullying affects 1 in 2 women & 1 in 3 men in the legal profession. Excellent session at the @worldbank today on the new International Bar Association report surveying nearly 7,000 men & women from law firms, in-house, barristers’ chambers, judiciary, and government from 135 countries. Urgent action is clearly needed, including awareness and training, the adoption of effective policies, and senior level commitment to effectively address the issue. #metoo #discrimination Read the report here: https://lnkd.in/e2snHxU

Reproductive freedom means freedom for everyone, and reproductive justice means that all people have the ability to have a healthy thriving family if they choose to do. This Fatherâ€™s Day weâ€™re honoring all the supportive dads out there, and reminding fathers that we need your voices and actions of support in the movement. According to all polling, abortion rights are supported by the majority of people across gendersâ€”this is the time to step up for all of our freedom. Happy Fatherâ€™s Day! âœ¨ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’œ

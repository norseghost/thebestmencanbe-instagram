🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊 Debut Single🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊 31st May 2019, 10am on YouTube 🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊 '  Rise Again’ is a anti-rape campaign song. I wrote the song as the voice of a rape survivor drawing the lyrics from real life stories I came across during my research phase of Rise Again. 
The goal of the song is to stir up a discussion geared towards awareness of Sexual gender-based Violence culture in Kenya.

The song writing process took a whole year😂😂😅sounds crazy when I say it but yes it took a whole year, Look at God just working miracles.

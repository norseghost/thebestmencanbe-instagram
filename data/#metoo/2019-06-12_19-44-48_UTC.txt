OWAA is at Legislative Hall in Dover to advocate for SB 78. This bill requires that health education programs presented by the Delaware Department of Education include instruction on what it means to “consent” in the context of a sexual encounter. Why is this important? Currently, Delaware public schools are not required to include consent and healthy relationship education in their sexuality education program. Check back at this post later today to find out what happens with the Senate vote. #DelawareWomen #metoo #girlstoo

Y’all. It’s so cool looking back on how much my life has changed in the last 500 days...Such a beautiful transformation that started with the decision to start healing on a soul level and a part of that for me was/is sobriety. 😭 ⁣
⁣
So freaking proud of myself for committing to the change, being a voice, breaking stigmas and challenging the norms. Sobriety has played such a pivotal role in my #SoulUp journey...no more numbing out...Only feeling and healing!⁣
⁣
Shout out to all of my sober fam...I SEE YOU and sending you LOVE LOVE LOVE! ⁣

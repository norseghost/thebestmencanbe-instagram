This was a comment I just received on my transformation post. And we wonder why women always have such a fucking complex?!? To be clear, I’m winning every single fucking day that I don’t have to be around someone like you. I’m winning every single day when I get out of bed and continue on with my life, without saying rude and negative shit towards people. How about, focus on yourself for a change, and maybe you’ll be a bit happier?!?! *END RANT*..... but not actually because this shit pisses me off
EDIT - I’m not hiding his name because he was stupid enough to comment. But this isn’t a call to go blast him. This is a call to watch your fucking mouth and realize what you say does have meaning. .

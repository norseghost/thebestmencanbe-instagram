Today I did something unexpected. I haven't written with intention in.....I can't even count the years. But today I had the time. I discovered the power running through as thoughts and had to put pen to paper because my being couldn't contain it any longer. So I wrote a poem. 
This is what it's like to be a womxn in the world. What it's like to be Latinx in this country. What it's like to be a minority who's always deemed as lesser. 
My journey is the same as yours but my story is personal and I hope sharing it with you inspires some feeling or flicker inside your soul. Thank you.

This is both tragic and triumphant - #productdevelopment Elective for seniors @fashionhighnyc - Students are instructed and guided in the content of innovating or modifying or improving a product. All young ladies explore what it takes to come up with customer awareness, purpose of a product, importance of aesthetics, pricing, competitors, packaging, advertising/promoting and even charitable aspects that can promote the function of altruism - This ONE #empoweredyoungwoman came up with an App #metoo - An app free of charge, dedicated to raising awareness about harassment, and keeping you updated on recent news about related topics. It even offers connections to therapy!! Itâ€™s tragic how the current date of affairs simmers a need for innovations of this type. Why must our young ladies have to come up with tools such as these? Ms. Nashalae is set to enter @fitnyc this fall as a Business Major freshmen #waytogogirl #proudofyou #futureceo

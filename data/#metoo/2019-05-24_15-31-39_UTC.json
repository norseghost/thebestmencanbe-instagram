                        "text": "#fridayfeels part 2 And after reflecting on that evening and after some introspective thought, I started to become less tired, because I could see another generation picking up the torch that us women have been trying to carry for all of these years, and for many people who lack a voice (our younger versions of ourselves and anyone who is marginalized). And we didn\u2019t even ask for help, mainly because no one was listening. Not to mention the reality that we have to be stronger than everyone (or appear that way) to succeed on a \u201clevel\u201d playing field.\n\nBelieve it or not, but the invention of the internet, digital technology and social media has at times distracted my own generation, as we are the first to try to be productive with all of this technology at our fingertips.\n\nThen it finally hit me: This new generation is figuring out their purpose and how to mobilize their global voice for the betterment of the environment and their fellow humans. What? How? When? It\u2019s like I blinked and saw a new world that isn't this giant mountain that I\u2019ve been climbing since the first time I realized that I was being marginalized for being a female or a minority (or both). And instead of discouraging this behaviour based on my own (tired) energy, I\u2019m going to sit up and listen and support these young future (and present Julia) leaders and soldiers as best as I can. \nSo as whiny as I sound in stating all of the above, go get it Julia - I see you, and, at 19, I am already so proud of you and the people you have chosen to surround yourself with. Here\u2019s to your achievements and your future successes. #dosomeinspiringshit\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#womensrights #reflection #feminism\n#empowereachother\n#ifitdoesntkillyou\n#nomeansno #endrapeculture\n#misogyny\n#equality\n#equalrightsforall\n#metoo #stopvictimblaming\n#abundancemindset #growthmindset\n#webstagram #inspired\n#selfie #natural #inspireme"

💋 sun kissed 💋 maybe a little too much tbh, my arms are still peeling from Cancun/LA this month ☀️

Let’s talk therapy. I’ve had a lot of travel time recently and gotten to reflect a bit more on my mental health — and my fam recently pushed me to get back into weekly therapy. I am a strong advocate for therapy for anyone else who might be healing from trauma, anxiety, depression, or anything else that might be hindering their happiness. THAT BEING SAID, it’s a lot easier to tell other people to go than to get myself to go.

I went to therapy regularly from like 4th to 11th grade...and haven’t really been since even though a lot of shit has gone down since. And I am REALLY GOOD at making excuses about it: I don’t have health insurance in that state, I don’t feel like I need it because I can already talk openly about my trauma in stages, and the biggest one, I DON’T HAVE TIME. A part of me calls BS on myself, but I know a part of me still feels really resistant...and I am sort of hoping that there will just be a moment when I feel ready to go back. Anyways, just something I’m thinking about 🤷🏻‍♀️ what’s your experience w therapy / what time-efficient ways do you take care of your mental health??

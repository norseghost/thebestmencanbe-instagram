The momentum increases and results are seen.\n.\nAs a Coach, I work with my clients to identify their goals ~ whether it is (just to name a few)\n\u2022to not wake up each morning and dread the life they are leading\n\u2022have a better work/life balance (and boundaries!)\n\u2022make a career advancement or a change \u2022make decisions aligned with their values (or to first learn and identify what are their values)\n\u2022to trust in themselves and the decisions they make \u2022limiting beliefs (imposter complex)\n\u2022the importance of self-care \u2022time management\n\u2022to transform a goal/dream into reality\n\u2022learn to like/love/value themselves .\nOnce the goals are identified we work together on how my client can break her goals down into baby steps so they are achievable as well as how to not sabotage herself.  In doing this work, I serve to help with accountability, to challenge when needed, to be supportive, to listen, to look at situations/problems differently, and to laugh together.\n.\nMy clients include women who are\n\u2022in transition whether it is ^returning to the workforce\n^children going to school or leaving home\n^becoming a couple and not losing herself ^becoming single and all that entails\n\u2022women advancing in the workplace, developing their leadership skills, learning how to have a seat at the table, finding a new career path\n\u2022stay-at-home moms \u2022wondering what is their purpose\n.\nMy coaching is virtual.  This means you and I can be anywhere and as long as we have an internet connection, we can connect.  It is a huge timesaver for clients in that they do not need to take the time out of their already busy day to drive to and from their appointments.  I also have an office in the northwest suburbs of Chicago for those nearby and who still prefer the face-to-face session.\n.\nI am passionate about the work I do.  I believe in empowering women to believe in themselves, improve their lives and live their life.  Let me know if you are interested in learning more about the work I do.

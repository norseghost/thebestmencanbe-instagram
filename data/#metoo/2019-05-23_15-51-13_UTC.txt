Just another typical angry feminist fighting for the most absurd things like; men not being able to tell women what to do with their bodies, equal pay for equal work, being safe and heard when coming forward about sexual assault, NOT having to fear sexual assault, education reforms that educate boys and girls on body respect and positivity, eco friendly government reforms to help keep our planet alive and a bunch of other silly little things like that.... #equalworkequalpay #abortionisawomansright #mybodymychoice #metoo #ibelieveyou

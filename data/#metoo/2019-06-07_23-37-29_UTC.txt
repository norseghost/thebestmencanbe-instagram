I am a sexual assault survivor. After I was assaulted on several occasions by two separate people, I blamed myself for what had happened. For years after I didn’t even know what had happened was even assault. When I did come to a understand what happened, I was horrified, embarrassed and painfully disgusted. I couldn’t believe someone would knowingly hurt another person the way they hurt me.⠀
⠀
With the support of trusted individuals, I was able to report the crimes that were committed against me. Through the process of seeking justice and therapy I had the realization and felt strongly that I am someone who needs to help others who have survived sexual crimes. ⠀
⠀
In times when I was meeting with my therapist and attorneys, they would say things to me like “you are not responsible for what happened”, “you don’t have to feel ashamed”, “you are safe here”, and so on.  When I was there, hearing those statements, I could feel myself beginning to believe them, but those people were “experts”, trained to know what to say. The everyday people, family and friends, that I spent most of my time with didn’t know what to say to help me feel better and to help me heal. So, I started writing down statements that helped me feel empowered and heal. And I immediately wanted to share them with other survivors. People I knew were experiencing the same things that I was.⠀
⠀
So, I made this Affirmation Deck. A deck of cards that survivors can have with them, and read: ⠀
when they are experiencing self-doubt, when they are having a panic attack, when they remember what happened, when they need positivity, they are having a hard day, or when they feel that they can help someone else.⠀
⠀
Or when complete strangers blame them for the crimes that were committed against them. I want to help survivors at any stage of their healing process so that they don’t have to talk about or tell anyone what happened, if they are not ready. They can go through these affirmations that will help their healing start. ⠀

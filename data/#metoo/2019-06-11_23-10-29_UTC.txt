Today's Pride Month Shoutout from an Ally is about Christianity and LGBTQ youth.  Now, don't get your knickers in a twist and don't jump in to tell me not ALL Christians are like that.  Please see #metoo.  Also, please note my long-standing beef(s) with organized religion.

Meet my friend James.  He was the inspiration for the Say My Name post.  A young man, claiming God was on his side, was interacting with James on his FB page and repeatedly called him his dead name, in spite of repeated requests from several people not to do that.  I admit that I was highly un-Christlike when I repeatedly referred to said young man as "Marjorie". James was a member of a church youth group when he came out as a lesbian, pre-transition.  This group had been a source of comfort and inspiration for James in the past.  The leaders of the group held multiple meetings with James as a middle-schooler, without his parents' permission, to remind him that he was sinning and that he needed to choose between the LGBTQ community and his church community.

James is now called by his correct name and gender within the congregation and feels loved and supported.  Not all young people share that end to this story.  James believes in the Bible and in Jesus Christ.  He also knows his heart and his mind and his body and believes that knowledge is quite compatible with his faith and his beliefs. 
At a tender, confusing, uncomfortable time, these adults chose to belittle and shame James instead of uplift and support him.  Hooray for all the churches (like the Church of Freedom in Christ Ministries) who recognize the power of their condemnation and move to make it right.  And boo to all the churches (I'm looking at you and your pals, Pope Francis) who continue to use dogma to perpetuate outdated, harmful policies.

Stay woke, my ally friends.

Just realized with all the craziness life has thrown at me recently, I never posted the final product on this beauty. 
39x30 
Watercolor, ink, and acrylic on paper. 
No name, but I don’t think she needs one. She’ll just be “Blue” for now. .
I HAVE to get painting again. Too much has gotten in the way from moving to work. On that note, any of my ATX buds know of any good (cheep) print makers? DM me referrals.

TRIGGER WARNING!: (Contains images and words about sexual assault)

I am proud to have been one of the 3,000 voices apart of the #monumentquilt, something that is much larger than myself. It is powerful that fellow survivors of sexual assault are standing together to create a public healing space and to share their stories. I am not proud, however, of the oppressive system and government that does not listen and give justice to survivors, especially to non-binary, trans, non-gender conforming individuals and women of color who are the most likely to become victims of assault. I stand with fellow survivors to stop victim blaming, victim shaming, and acts of sexual violence. 
Teach consent early on, know the statistics, and educate yourself, please. Do it for your loved ones and friends, because you may not realize who has been affected. If you see something, do something. Together, we can work toward a better future, one that does not involve sexual abuse.

Survivors, you are strong. I am so proud of you. You are worthy, you are heard and you are not alone. ‚ô•Ô∏èüå± #triggerwarningsexualassault

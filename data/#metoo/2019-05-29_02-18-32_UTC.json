                        "text": "I picked up TRUST EXERCISE by Susan Choi when I read a profile in @vulture that said, in part:\n.\n\u201cIt is the sort of page-turning metafiction that readers love to argue about \u2014 a Gen-X bildungsroman that speaks to younger generations, a Russian nesting doll of unreliable narrators, and a slippery #MeToo puzzle-box about the fallibility of memory. It\u2019s also a paean to anger, arguably the defining emotion of our time, and after decades of tamping it down, Choi came by it honestly around the time Donald Trump got elected and she separated from her husband. \u2018I\u2019m conscious of having been so mad during so much of the writing of this book,\u2019 she says. \u201cLike really mad.\u2019\u201d\n.\nIt was one of the \u201cmost anticipated\u201d books of 2019 in every outlet and...it\u2019s fucking crazy. In a good way. Speaking as an editor, if I had worked on this book it might have broken me\u2014in terms of the narrative structure, she is GOING FOR IT. Whoa. And then you\u2019ve got the story itself, which is smart and gripping and uncomfortable and so real you want to clean its scent off of you when you\u2019re done. Absolutely masterful in so many ways. I will say that I wasn\u2019t 100% satisfied by the ending, but that was partly because I wanted to know more about these wildly compelling characters\u2014and the conceit of TRUST EXERCISE is that you can\u2019t and never will know every side to every story. Fair enough! I\u2019ll be thinking about this one for a long time...\n.\n.\n.\n#books #bookstagram #shelfie #trustexercise #bookrecommendations #summerreading #amreading #literaryfiction #novels #unreliablenarrator"

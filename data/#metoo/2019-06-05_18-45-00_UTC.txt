It is often hard to look for the positive in a day. .
.
Trust me I totally get it. .
.
Right now I feel like everything is coming crashing down. I made the decision to follow my dream and close my daycare, and rent an office. Once I made that decision the universe has been testing me. .
.
Our car is broke down, and  my roof is caving in and is leaking. .
.
But I am choosing to look at the grateful thing in my life. Because it can always be worse. I am choosing to be blessed.
.
.
I am blessed with 2 healthy little boys who are the light of my life. I have a roof over my head and food on my table. .
.
What are you grateful for? .

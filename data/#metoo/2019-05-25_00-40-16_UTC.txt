Lol he deleted the post I quoted but basically he wanted an in-house unpaid intern to produce his music for “real life experience and lots of fun” trash. A lot of talented people can not afford to work the necessary unpaid internships to get aheadnin their careers. This means mostly rich white kids get these opportunities whole those held down by systematic oppression. Don’t hire someone if you can’t afford to pay them. - rachel ♀(she/her/hers) #feminism #feminist #intersectionalfeminism #blm #blacklivesmatter #intersectionalfeminist  #neverthelessshepersisted #lgbt #loveislove #respectsexworkers #transrightsarehumanrights  #timesup #metoo #antisemitism #neveragain #gunreformnow #climatechangeisreal #enoughisenough #woke #lgbt #lgbtq🌈 #ableism #vote #yesallmen #sustainability #sexworkisrealwork

We are strong individually, but we are also strong together. Sometimes when I look back at the last 10 years I think, "How did I survive?" How did I survive being married to an abusive man, being a full time student, working, being a landlord and raising/trainingÂ  a new puppy all at the same time?? How did I find the strength and courage to leave him, rebuild my life, recover from sexual assault and move to another country? Phew lots of work!

You are strong too. On the days you feel like itÂ  and the days you dont. Take time to reflect. How did you survive your dark days? And where does your strength come from?

Still a Queen ðŸ‘‘âœŠ.

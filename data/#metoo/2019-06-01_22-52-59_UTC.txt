A raw post.
.
All my life I've been over weight.
I constantly binge ate my feeling.
I was bullied almost my whole school career; from 1st grade when I started gaining weight up until senior year of high school.
My parents weren't the best people so I didn't have a safe place to go.
.
Food was the way I filled the void of my father.
Food was how I delt with my abusive mother.
Food was the only thing there for me, besides my couple of close friends but I never really told anyone about my childhood or how my mom really was out of fear.
.
But, I'm not a scared little kid anymore.
I'm a grown woman who has a lot to say.
I woman who's proud of who shes becoming.
A woman who's gaining the self confidence.
A woman who doesn't need to fill the void of her absent father or abusive mom because I don't need them.
A strong woman who is capable of anything I put my mind to.
A woman who is going to make an impact on this world.
A woman on a journey to health and happiness.
A woman who is going to write a book.
.
I'm closing the door on this chapter in my life.
I choose to be happy and healthy.
I choose to love myself.
.
And to my younger self.
I'm sorry.
You deserved better.

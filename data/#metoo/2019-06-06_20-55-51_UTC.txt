✨JULY 20th - 10AM TO 2PM ✨

Healing from sexual trauma is difficult and often pushed aside in favor of forgetting. It can flare up at any time and leave a survivor feeling broken and alone. We strongly believe that taking a moment to understand yourself and your needs is vital to moving forward! 
The Enneagram can be an incredible tool for seeking self-enlightenment and healing. This class will be taught by our very own Vice President, @kelseysedelia. We're excited to offer a safe space where you can learn about yourself and your needs without fear of judgement. 
This will be a 'conference like' event. We will be teaching about the Enneagram, facilitating conversations, and encouraging tough discussions from 10am to 2pm with a lunch break around 11:30am. 
Because this is such an in depth class there are limited spaces! It is a free event (donations are always appreciated) but we ask that you reserve your spot through the Eventbrite ticket link on our FB page.

THE MISOGYNY TRIALS
It is the year 2030. Misogyny has been outlawed since 2020, yet this undesirable practice still lurks in the dark corners of modern-day society. 
The amazing performance by Womanly Words productions represents a snapshot of cases brought before Judge Hope, a commanding woman who has made it her mission to stamp out misogyny in all its guises. 
This funny, tragic, thoughtful play is back following a sold-out performance in February & rave reviews - here are a few:
·  Fabulous & Funny. Made my cheeks hurt.
·  Really thought provoking
·  Witty, good hearted & very perceptive
·  Very funny/relevant
·  Take it into schools
·  A great way to provoke serious reflection, great performances! Would recommend!
·  A very entertaining evening with brilliant writing and acting.
·  Well directed and acted funny yet provocative!
·  100% I would recommend. Keep it going, make it bigger!
·  Really fun for the whole family.
·  Incredible, humour yet sensitive and very well portrayed.
·  Do it again, again, again!

                        "text": "So as many of you may know, about two years ago I experienced a sexual assault that has been very traumatic, and for the past two years we have been battling through an ongoing investigation and now legal trial. This summer I will finally have the chance to take a stand and tell my story. However, no matter what happens with the trial I will forever be affected by what happened to me, and my life will likely never be the same. I have developed severe PTSD and depression, and every single day is a fight. In order to feel safe to grow and develop after my trial ends, I am going to be legally changing my first name. This way, my perpetrator will not be able to find me or any information about me online as he will not know my new name. This is something that I have chosen to do for MYSELF, as it will make me feel a little bit safer. I also think a name change is an opportunity for reinvention and change, and hopefully will give me a sense of emotional recovery after it\u2019s all said and done. I have chosen to rename myself \u201cAmbrose\u201d. This decision has been hard and picking a name has been a process, but this is the name I\u2019ve felt the most throughout the process. Ambrose means \u201cever-living\u201d which to me, represents my endurance and my promise to myself that no matter what happens I will keep fighting and keep living for myself and no one else. I am choosing to begin transitioning into this name now, and I understand that it may take some getting used to but I ask that you all make your best attempt to make the switch. Thank you to all of you for supporting me throughout this process and I can\u2019t wait to show you all the man that I, Ambrose, can be.\n\n#notavictim #survivor #metoo"

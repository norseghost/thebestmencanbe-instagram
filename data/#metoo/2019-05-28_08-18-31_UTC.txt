We’ve adapted our name, Future Female was always about human voices and inclusion of humans taking responsibility to own who we want to be and not the stereotype label that is put on us at birth. We think the adaption does just that. What do you think? .
.
You may want to be known as female, male, gay, gender neutral or whatever label you classify yourself as. The point for the work we are doing is to have an open discussion about equality, so we we can address everyday habitual sexism as humans, it effects us all, some are more marginalised and deal with gender bias than others. Yes we stand up for feminism, but the word does not define us and is not the only route to the action we want to see. A big thanks to the wonderful women out advisory team particularly @karolinabarnes who specialises in branding + came up with the plus sign. And @emma_gardner_elvis giving her eye and time ❤️❤️

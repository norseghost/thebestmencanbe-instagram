iâ€™m always afraid to say iâ€™m bi, because people treat it as a â€˜trendâ€™. not only that, but 2 members of my family (auntie, cousin) would say that bisexual doesnâ€™t exist - that itâ€™s just â€˜greedyâ€™. they arenâ€™t homophobic in the slightest, and theyâ€™re lovely people, but they just donâ€™t â€˜believe in itâ€™. itâ€™s difficultðŸ˜•

Japan's Health and Labour Minister Takumi Nemoto responded to the popular #KuToo petition against the requirement of women to wear heels at work. Nemoto said such dress codes are “necessary and appropriate” in the workplace. The movement, launched by actor and freelance writer Yumi Ishikawa, collected more than 20,000 signatures and was submitted to the labour ministry on Tuesday. #KuToo was derived from a play on the Japanese words “kutsu”, meaning shoe, and “kutsuu”, meaning pain, and is also a reference to the global #MeToo movement.

Much like the past couple of decades, victims really started to speak out in the nineties, and prevention programs included to increase. It seemed like everything was going well for the movement, but unfortunately the nineties brought a lot of backlash, especially for prevention organizations, \u201cFunders, policy makers and the general public started calling for programs and service organizations to be accountable and clearly demonstrate the impact of their work\u201d (NCDSZ). In addition to this, \u201cthe accomplishments of the feminist movement have been manipulated and used against women,\u201d victims started to face adversity and are often called liars. Here the marginalization of sexual assault victims has peaked, and this era has continued to present day. #metoo #metoomovement #1990s #rapeculture"

“They say to behold a Valkyrie is to stare unflinching into flame.” 🌻 Signed sets of all three of my poetry books are available on my Etsy! Buying them there is actually cheaper than purchasing them separately from other retailers, plus they’re signed and you get a pretty lil ribbon! Pls buy them so I can get cool merch at the Twenty One Pilots concert next week. Link is in my bio. 😭✌🏻

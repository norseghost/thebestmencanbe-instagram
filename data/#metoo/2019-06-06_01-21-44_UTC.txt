Today marked the beginning of an eight-week, in-depth reporting project on sexual assault that the newsroom at the Steamboat Pilot & Today is producing. I am so very proud of our team of journalists. Each and every member of the news staff is contributing, and they've been working hard on the series since February. I also am grateful to be collaborating with a number of fantastic organizations including Advocates of Routt County, Steamboat Creates, Young Bloods Collective, Routt County United Way, Mind Springs Health, UCHealth and The BARley to host a culminating In Our Shoes event on July 27 at Library Hall and an art exhibit at the Depot Art Center during the month of August. The purpose of this series, which will run every Wednesday through July 24, is to spark a community conversation about a subject that has remained in the dark for far too long. #InOurShoes #steamboatnews #MeToo #SpeakUpSpeakOut #ItsNotOkay

Strong woman arent simply born. We are forged through the challenges of life. With each challenge we grow mentally and emotionally. We move forward with our head held high and a strength that can not be denied. A woman who's been through the storm and survived those women are warriors. #warrior #survivor #metoo #loveyourself

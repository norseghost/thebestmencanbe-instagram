😐😐 Congratulations Ladies - The #metoo chronicles " Now more than a year into the #MeToo movement -- with its devastating revelations of harassment and abuse in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond -- Wall Street risks becoming more of a boy’s club, rather than less of one...💁🏾‍♀️ No more dinners with female colleagues. Don’t sit next to them on flights. Book hotel rooms on different floors. Avoid one-on-one meetings.

Across Wall Street, men are adopting controversial strategies for the #MeToo era and, in the process, making life even harder for "A manager in infrastructure investing said he won’t meet with female employees in rooms without windows anymore; he also keeps his distance in elevators. A late-40-something in private equity said he has a new rule, established on the advice of his wife, an attorney: no business dinner with a woman 35 or younger." #ART #artvism #activism #Apparel #Fashion #design #Tees #socialjustice #politiwear #history #humanrights #questions #metoo #himtoo #manhood

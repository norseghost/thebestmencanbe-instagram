And in the aftermath of Jonathan's assault, I couldn't understand.\n\nAfter all, he was my friend. \nAnd it was this, rather than the facts of what he did, that devastated me.\n\nI guess I hadn\u2019t taken my own oppression seriously. I had believed Jonathan\u2019s misogyny was just a flaw, one that we could work around. One we could fix. I hadn't understood that there was no fixing it. At least not with my help. It didn\u2019t matter what I said since I would always be the one saying it. Me. Female. \nThere would never be a time that I would be able to step out of my gender or sex and just be heard as human. Misogyny, like racism, is in the very air we breathe. It\u2019s in our early readers and coloring books and Disney films and Saturday morning cartoons. And Jonathan had worn those lenses for so long that the tint they gave to everything had become, for him, the shade that the world really was. He had never truly seen me at all. \nMy story at mceaston.com #metoo #abuse #misogyny"

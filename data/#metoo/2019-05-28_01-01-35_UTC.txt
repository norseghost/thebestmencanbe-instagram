Womenâ€™s bodies slaughtered on our streets. Again.
The desensitised voices of the news take pleasure in watching her family grieve, of its brutal nature.
Every time I hear it the fire in my belly ignites. I feel my trauma surging through my fingers, up my spine until it reaches every inch of my body. 
Every time a woman is assaulted, hurt, murdered and tossed away like garbage my body hurts with hers. 
At 14 I was raped in a park. Sometimes I wonder, how did I manage to survive and not her.

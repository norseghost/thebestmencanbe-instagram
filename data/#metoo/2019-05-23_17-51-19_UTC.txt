This is still pretty new to me- keeping up on social media, being the face of a business (my business). I’m still constantly seeking advice, comparing myself to others, and judging myself. I mean, common, I’m still human. I still watch the Bachelorette every week, I still eat tacos every Tuesday. It’s hard tbh, because sometimes life gets in the way of being all I want to be as a spokesperson to my business. .

This month is #mentalhealthawareness month, which is something I’ve dealt with for a while now. I know it’s a stigma, and it’s a stigma for it to be a stigma (if that’s a thing). There’s a #metoo movement, which I try to resonate with but many times it doesn’t feel like me too, it feels like me. . .

I’d love to be one of those people that encourages you to be aware of the mental health issues around you, but more than likely you already know a few people who deal with this. So instead I want to say just buy em a coffee (or a smoothie if you prefer). Just be a friend. Make them feel normal, and tell them they’re loved. That’s literally enough. Because they are enough. You are enough. .

That’s all- happy Thursday friends!

On my way to each counselling session, I meticulously plan everything I'm going to say. I try to imagine how my counsellor will respond to my problems and come up with a mental list of the best possible answers to her questions

So here I was this morning, taking selfies in the loo, and thinking I had it all figured out

Needless to say, the session didn't go quite the way I'd planned. Have you seen the episode of Fleabag where she asks her new therapist whether she should fuck the priest and she's like: "You already know what you're gonna do. Everybody does. You've already decided what you're going to do." Well, I went into the session thinking that I'm probably going to fuck the priest (fucking the priest is just a metaphor in my case ok?!) while knowing full well that fucking the priest might not be the right thing to do because whenever I've dabbled with religion in the past, it's not gone so well

BUT... to my surprise, my counsellor made me realise that *maybe* fucking the priest wouldn't be such a bad idea. I hope she doesn't read this though because I know she'd be screaming at her phone like "THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID". Okay, so maybe I shouldn't fuck the priest but maybe I could kiss the priest and see what happens next. I can't stop myself from doing things that I want to do just because a bunch of religious nuts whose beliefs I don't even agree with might not approve of my decision. I can't turn down opportunities for happiness because I'm scared that afterwards, I'll end up burning in the depths of hell for all eternity

She also made me realise that I try too hard to plan every aspect of my life and predict down to every last detail how it's going to go. But you probably could have told me that having read the first sentence of this post

Did you know that when a child is sexually abused, that part of their brain actually pauses at that age... it ACTUALLY stops to grow at the age of the abuse in a sense? It's a fact. So when you meet people that seem a little "off" (to your standards)  be careful to not make quick assumptions that they're childish or just do things for attention. We all have a past..some bad that we created, some bad that people created for us. But nonetheless,  we all respond to trauma and pain differently, right? Some can walk out like warriors, and some started out shorthanded from the beginning. But to expect everyone to be as great as you are, strong as you are, or to adapt as you have would only be fair if our pasts were identical. But I think that you'd discover very quickly that the ones you judge to be "off", have a story that you aren't even brave enough to have even been a spectator of. Most times I look in the mirror and I see her. The little me. Most times, I see thru HER eyes. You havent seen what I've seen. You havent been where I've been. ðŸ¦‹ "If you gonna love me, ya gotta love all of me."- Khalid

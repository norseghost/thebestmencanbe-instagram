So guess who is popping by for a cuppa? Yours truly... If you are so called to make your voice heard this week* there will be ample opportunity to, with protests across the UK during the US Presidents' state visit. For example, there will be a @carnival_of_resistance for Tuesday, 4th June in Trafalgar Square from 11am onwards.

Today, the women of Switzerland took to the streets and I am grateful I got to be one of them. ‚úå‚ù§

This country, my nation, is sadly still quite far behind when it comes to equality and women's rights. In 1990, there was still one canton where women had no right to vote. I was already alive when that finally changed. And still today, being a woman in this country is far from how it should be. Most women make significantly less money than their male counterparts. Having a baby here usually means the end of your career due to this country's outdated maternity leave system (and basically no viable options at all for men to share the load). Only 3% of all the CEOs in this country are female. The list goes on...

I am happy women made themselves heard today. I'm grateful they presented their demands to the government who promised improvements. I feel lucky that we got to stand up here today for feminism, equality for all, diversity and sexual freedom. A big shoutout and heartfelt THANK YOU to all the wonderful, nasty women out there, and the amazing men alongside us who are fighting for our cause ‚ù§üåç

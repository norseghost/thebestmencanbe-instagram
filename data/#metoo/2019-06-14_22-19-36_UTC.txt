Part 3 of 4
My follow up question to Victoria  was inspired by #RebeccaTraister ‘s  #GoodAndMad Reading her book made me embrace the value of women’s anger during our current #metoo movement.  Being angry for women is often disapproved of. However our collective rage channeled towards positive change will move us toward  #equality & #parity. 
What made Victoria mad was discovering one of the prosecutors in the Central Park Five trial was a trustee of her college, an institution that she trusts for their integrity and openness.

Lastly, I wanted to know if women today feel that their voices are heard when they do speak up and demand change. 
For Victoria, it was taking action through a campus wide petition circulated to demand the removal of to Linda Fairstein from the college’s board. 
LISTEN TO VICTORIA’S NUANCE RESPONSE TO HOW SHE AND HER FELLOW VASSAR STUDENTS DEMANDED CHANGE.

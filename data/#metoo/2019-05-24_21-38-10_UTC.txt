This may be your first impression of me. You may not have even known, and may attach this stigma to me. You may know the person. You may have already known and silently edged away from me, without knowing the facts. You are entitled to your own choice. But I hope I have opened your eyes on the issue. 
If you're still reading, I'd like to thank each and every one of you who has been there for me. Provided a shoulder to lean on. Given an ear to speak to. 
I vow that no one has to go through any of this. Thank you for reading, and let us all lift the carpet on this issue which has so often been brushed under it. - Kumaran

KEEP PERSPECTIVE!⠀
⠀
I really never dreamed I would be here....doing this!  Honestly, I’m a complete introvert and loathe putting myself out in front of people!  To even talk in-front of people I start get the sweaty armpits 💦, my heart starts racing, my brain literally stops functioning.....you can just chalk me up as a walking disaster! 🌪 ⠀
⠀
Embarrassing for me and comical to those that get to witness! 🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️⠀
⠀
So how did I get here? How did I go from:
⠀
🚫the girl that had so little believe in herself⠀
🚫the girl that always wanted to hide behind the lens⠀
🚫the girl that was filled with fear and self-doubt⠀
⠀  TO:
💃🏼The girl that believes my purpose is worthy!⠀
💃🏼The girl that is unashamedly stepping into the lens to share her story and passion to help women!⠀
💃🏼 The girl that is using her fear and self-doubt as fuel for her WHY and bigger purpose!⠀
⠀
I watched as other women built their confidence, business, and future for their families through coaching and mentoring others to be a better version of themselves and who they are called to be!  And after sitting on the sidelines watching, wishing, and hoping that could be #metoo, I took the leap of faith and went all in!  And I won’t look back! ⠀
⠀
If you are that girl that is watching me on the sidelines and also has the desire deep down that you were “Made for More,” that you have a bigger purpose; don’t let your vision for your goals get clouded. ⠀
⠀
👉🏼KEEP PERSPECTIVE👈🏼⠀
⠀
Perspective in who you are and what you want for YOU!  Coaching has brought new confidence in me that I never knew I had!  It’s providing our family extra income each month to help cover the costs of groceries and daycare. Knowing the potential of where I can go and want to go with this business, makes me keep my perspective in mind and that much more focused! ⠀
⠀
So why not you? I would love to show you and help mentor you in how you can use YOUR STORY to help others! ⠀
⠀
I can’t promise it’s going to always be smooth sailing, but with your desire, your WHY, and persistent consistency, you can build that life you hoped for and dreamed of! ⠀

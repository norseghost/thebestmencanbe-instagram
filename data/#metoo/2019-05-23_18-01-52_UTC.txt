We have entered a time in history unlike anything I've ever seen, where men have been silenced by the feminist movement. Now, please don't misunderstand my meaning here...there are SOME behaviours that should have been brought to light and called on! #harveyweinstein⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Absolutely!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But the unintended victims have been the good men...the really good, well meaning and AMAZING men that just don't know how to respond to the backlash from a few bad apples. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
To the men out there that are dealing with an unplanned pregnancy, you DO have a voice! That baby is HALF YOUR DNA! It's YOUR BABY TOO! Abortion is NOT the only solution!  Choose life for your baby! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Go on! You GOT THIS! You're going to be a GREAT DADDY!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Love, R.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

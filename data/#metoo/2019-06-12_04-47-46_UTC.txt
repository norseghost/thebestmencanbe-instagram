Dear @tracytutor, thank you. It's not easy to digest what you said, but when you're right, you're right. We can and should do better.⁣
⁣
For over 16 years, we've prided ourselves on being the publication that pulls no punches, that holds the industry accountable for everything from misleading marketing tactics, to the massive gender disparity in the C-suite, to sexual harassment. We were among the first outlets to do a deep dive into real estate's reckoning with the #MeToo movement and we were the first outlet to crunch the numbers on how stark the gender gap is. We've done these stories despite facing immense pressure, both legal and financial, from industry figures, including some of our biggest advertisers.⁣
⁣
Our events strive to further this mandate. We aim to present a discussion that is reflective of the demographics of the industry we cover. Our previous panels, all over the country and the world, have showcased the views of a broad array of leading industry professionals, female and male, white and black, gay and straight. This time, we fell short. We're going to take a hard look at how we put our panels together so that this doesn't happen again.⁣
⁣
We also want to hear from our readers and followers. Rather than leave things in the dark, talk to us: Tell us what you'd like to see improve. For starters, we saw that @thejoshaltman is giving up his spot on the panel. We'd love you, our readers, to nominate a top female real estate professional from the L.A. area that you believe deserves to take his place in addition to the two female powerhouses we currently have as part of the panel discussions. Tag your nominee below or email us at megan@therealdeal.com

Sincerely @mrkorangy, Publisher

As someone who used to do this and being around those who do, I know firsthand how toxic and pathetic it is to stay sad and hope attention will help you. I was slapped in the face with reality by a great friend of mine, and I'm not saying people need to be treated harshly, but they shouldn't be allowed to suck attention from people.

ðŸ—£ JLDH upcoming event tomorrow -

In the lead up to the UK-hosted PSVI international conference in November 2019, this event is the second in a series on the widespread proliferation of sexual violence in conflict.

Containing personal speeches from victims of sexual violence in conflict, parliamentarians and campaigners, this event will bring together all those concerned into a discussion about how we can build on the steps taken to end it for good.

The evening will conclude with the unveiling of a specially commissioned statue by sculpture artist Rebecca Hawkins to commemorate victims of sexual violence. ðŸ‘‰ http://bit.ly/jldhevent

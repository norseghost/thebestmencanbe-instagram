✨"This. This is why I never said anything. Because no one ever believes the girl."

✨Mara and Owen are about as close as twins can get. So when Mara’s friend Hannah accuses Owen of rape, Mara doesn’t know what to think. Can the brother she loves really be guilty of such a violent crime? Torn between her brother and friend, Mara must face a trauma from her past to deal with the difficult questions of consent and victim blaming.

✨I had high hopes for this book from all the reviews I read and since it deals with such an important topic: sexual assault. I don’t usually read this genre, so I had a hard time getting into it and I almost DNF it a few times. I read other reviews for this and a lot of people said this book made them cry. I had a hard time connecting with the characters and I didn’t really connect with them enough to be emotional. I think the problem was the book was just too young for me. The overall story was well written and an easy read, but ultimately it wasn’t for me.

Long ago this lovely place helped me get through a very rough time in my life. I’m so grateful for the phone support (3am), group counseling, individual counseling (I had no insurance) and so if you are considering a worthwhile place to donate to, now or in the future, @rcasa1986 is a great choice. Thanks again @rcasa1986 . This survivor made it to a great year, found a loving partner, had precious kids, and found a livelihood she loves. Never give up. You’re never alone. Don’t give in to abyss. May you all find peace and healing .❤️❤️❤️ #survivor #metoo #liveanotherday #neveralone #peace #hope

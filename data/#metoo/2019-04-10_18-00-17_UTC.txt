Sexeducation
__________________
Women are slowly moving towards parity in the boardroom, but not in the bedroom. Why are straight women having less satisfying sex than men? And what can we do about it?
The world is supposed to be improving for women. Incrementally, work is being done to combat sexual harassment, improve maternity-leave, and close the wage gap.

But what about the pleasure gap?

There is a lot of work still to be done. “Pleasure requires trust, but in our society, we talk about sex in a way that creates shame and secrecy. Unfortunately, without comprehensive sex education in middle and high schools, I doubt we’ll get close to providing a safe enough environment for young people who are curious about sexual activity to practice it safely and therefore figure out what is pleasurable.” She believes we need to start with how we teach children to understand, regard and care for themselves. This includes talking about intersex identities, and exploring gender and sexuality across a very fluid spectrum. “Building self-esteem has to be a priority, especially in a society that tries its hardest to make you feel bad about yourself. Becoming empowered, working on self-esteem and healthy body image, and having relationships that are emotionally supportive and psychologically healthy can help all people get more pleasure in their sex lives, because they can help them get more out of their relationships in general.” More on: http://t.ted.com/thmVC5y

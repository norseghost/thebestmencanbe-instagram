This Verse Changed my life!
.
.
One day walking in a foot of snow with flats on I asked myself.... why I am I doing this? I am an adult...I felt the cold snow enter my shoe, only minutes left before my toes will be numb....10 minutes to go...Another step I take... I shouldn‚Äôt have to walk 20 minutes to see my family...I‚Äôm a grown woman...what is wrong with me?...Why?...I take another step... my foot hits a patch of ice and I fall... I lay face up in the middle of the neighborhood street....I wonder will I be noticed...will I be missed, if I just lay there. What is my purpose? Am I just a puzzle piece to be used? I begin to feel pins and kneedles in my fingers, feeling the snow fall onto my face, I sit up and say I am worthy. I am loved...I am not a slave.... I stand up & stumble the rest of the way home...

Shortly after this and a few other situations I came across this verse and I continued to see it throughout my life! .
.
Including the day after I finally broke the silence! .
.
I share this on my healing page because I believe in a mind, body, soul approach to healing! If you don‚Äôt begin to heal the wounds from the past they will eat you up inside! No other less-harsh way of saying it!

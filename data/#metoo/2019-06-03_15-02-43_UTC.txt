Thank you to Caroline Makaka, @loaniglobal and the Universal Peace Federation for being awarded the beautiful survivors award.

Thank You Caroline for trusting me to be a member of the board for LOANI and listening to my ideas about where I would like to support LOANI. 
The amazing women who also received awards last night, are all beautiful survivors that all have a mission to complete and are beckons of lights. 
The journey that I have travelled on has being such an amazing experience. 
I have no regrets and am proud of where I am today. I have experienced things that I know others would not have know how to deal with and unpick to carry on.

I was blessed last night as my amazing parents were present to hear me talk and receive my award, it was a pleasure to acknowledge that they have shaped me into the women that I am today and given me the tools to bring love to myself and more importantly thank them.

Thank You Nim, for supporting me on this journey and sharing my story as it’s includes his story which I know is difficult to share and acknowledge at times .

My passion is to empower people on the journey of life, so that they can achieve the gaols that they have set and to incorporate this the 1st aspect to have Self L💜Ve for yourself.

I know that everything is achievable with Self L💜Ve and direction, this is why I work with my clients via Reiki, Self L💜Ve , coaching , healing, workshops to get them to be where they want to be as it’s worked for me 💜

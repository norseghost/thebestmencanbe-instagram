“Empowered women, empower other women.” 👑
.

Last week, I had the honor of being a guest on the @safeplacecampus podcast hosted by @bryantlsmith. In the “Womanhood” episode, I had the opportunity to speak with @jabreewebber and @bryantlsmith about women’s safety, women’s right’s and @jabreewebber’s new film #ItHappenedOneNight. Y’all! Be sure to follow @ihonfilm — #ItHappenedOneNight combines the conversations of #MeToo and #ProChoice in a way that really makes you think about how women are valued in this country. Thank you @bryantlsmith for opening your platform for these important conversations and for our voices as women to be heard.

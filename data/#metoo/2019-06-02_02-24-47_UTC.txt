Happy 4ever to my amazing husband! Iâ€™m so grateful for you every dang day. Marriage is hard like really hard, I blame my parents making it look so dang easy ðŸ¤£ but it is worth every second! It may not be ðŸŒˆ & ðŸ¦‹ but Iâ€™m so glad to have you by my side through it all!

We went to Skyline Park Atlanta to celebrate and man did we have a blast! We had hot dogs, frosÃ¨, Moscow mules, and played mini golf, carnival games and rode the fun slide! This is a night weâ€™ll remember forever and to spend so many more with you!ðŸ’•

This is how I walk. This is why I hate my life. This is why I am so miserable. Four years of struggle and this is how I walk. Makes me die inside a little more each day. Today I woke up dead, there was no more joy left inside my broken brain. #sad #ptsd #ptsdawareness #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #metoo #walk #disabled #depressededitsðŸ˜·ðŸ”« #depression #suicide #alone #goodbye #loser #failure #joke #retard #gimp #why #brain

this is a serious post and i suppose im exposing something major that happened to me. thinking its funny to make "rape jokes" in public. imagine being ignorant to the fact that people around you may know someone thats been sexually abused or even be a victim of abuse. imagine that people are actually out there having to deal with that. imagine saying straight to my face that "sure, its not that bad" , "girls should be flattered" and "if she wears revealing clothes shes asking for it", lets back up a bit. imagine saying straight to MY face -a girl that was sexually abused at the age of 4 to the age of 14 by someone that was supposed to take care of her and love her- that RAPE is okay. you may think nobody thats around you will take offence to your sick joke but take into account that RAPE HAPPENS TO REAL PEOPLE and IT IS NOT A SICK JOKE FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS TO MAKE FUN OF #metoo #rapevictim

A year ago I decided to migrate because I didn't feel safe as a lesbian and as a woman in my sunny Caribbean. I wanted to find a place where I could live a life free from violence and fear... I'm still searching, but living in a place where windows have no iron bars, is definitely an improvement. #feministeurope #intersectionalfeministtravels #feministmigration #womenactivists #sisterhoodfightssexism #sisterhood #womenofcolor #lgbtmigrants #lgbti #metoo #timesup #stoptheviolence #streetharrassment

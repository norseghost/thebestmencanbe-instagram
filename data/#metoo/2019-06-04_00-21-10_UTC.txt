@aegpresentsrm has pretty much taken over all the #majorevents in #Denver, taking over venues that #localproducers once used, and NOT regularly utilizing the amazing Denver Talent as openers or even headliner.  Instead they book trash like this guy who represents everything the artist community is fighting and trying to keep out of our communities by NOT giving them a platform in our city. It also saddens me that enough people bought tickets to warrent a second show!  #AEG has changed the #entertainment game in Denver and NOT for the better and they are getting Rich by marginalizing the local scene and bringing trash to our city!

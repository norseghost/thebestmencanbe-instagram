We had such a fun & inspiring discussion tonight with Author & Radio Personality @iamjaenash about her new book, “Girl Power: Uncensored,” which is scheduled to release next month! 💞This book is so encouraging for women and will help so many come forth and share their stories like the women in this book! Check out what we discussed now by visiting the #linkinbio! 💞🎧 You can also keep up with new episodes from the show via #Spotify, & #iHeart Radio! 🎧
Music featured on tonight’s show was from Hip Hop Artist @b.o.b._siy!

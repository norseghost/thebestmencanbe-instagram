When you are abused you become a victim and will often take on a victim mentality because the trauma is excruciating.  Unless you receive help in the form of counseling and therapy often times you began to inflict pain onto yourself.....
💔
This pain can come from bodily harm like cutting, eating disorders, drugs and alcohol, promiscuous behaviors because you no longer feel worthy of being.....
💔
But you are worthy, our abusers win if we don’t get the necessary help. Our abusers win if we don’t overcome what they did to us with help. 💔
Let’s tell our abusers that we are stronger than they are by incorporating self love into our daily regiment, getting help through counseling and therapy.  It’s a process my beautiful people.  We will get through this together.

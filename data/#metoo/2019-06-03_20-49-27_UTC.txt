I have learned in the process of writing my memoir- Unprotected that it is a journey into myself- these undiscovered parts of me have hurt some days and other days left me in awe. What I know for sure is that this is the most cathartic journey of my life. I will walk away stronger and better *sips tea* ☕️💋 #raewrites #unprotected #hivpositive  #metoo ——————————————-

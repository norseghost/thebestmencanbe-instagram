Happy #celebrity birthday to Josephine Baker (born June 3, 1906) 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
In honor of Pride Month, we celebrate Ms. Baker for being one of the most successful African American performers in “her”story! Not only did she use her fame to do good, but she was one of the most well known and notorious Vaudeville dancers in Paris. She was also a spy! Josephine helped French military officials during WWII, by  passing war secrets that she overheard from Nazi soldiers during her performances. And she used notes written in invisible ink to do it! Later in life, she fought racial injustices and was a civil rights champion. She also openly had intimate relationships with other women, including Frida Kahlo. Ms. Baker pursued her first love, performing, until just a few days before her passing in 1975. She believed that “The things we truly love stay with us always, locked in our hearts as long as life remains.”

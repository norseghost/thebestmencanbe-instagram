A delayed post-  #lapshot from the opening night of Prima Facie written by the incredible Suzie Miller, directed by Lee Lewis @griffintheatre 
I have been following the work of Suzie Miller for 13 years... watching her integrity and values play out on pages and stages... a sharp mind and vigorous pulse.
Prima Facie is an exquisite culmination of a moment - how our legal system balances precariously on precedent, and weighed heavilly by a male lens. 
The night I saw it, a landmark, and intergenerationally fractious case was settled. A man was awarded defamation damages... on the back of #metoo, at a time of #womenforTrump... we need to examine the set of personal and political circumstances that form our world view - on privilege,  on sex, on gender, equality... Prima Facie also offers a space to shed light on the most dangerous and insidious of all frameworks: female misogyny.

Congratulations on a very real, timely, focused new Australian play, packing a punch - and not just because Sheridan Harbridge is a force to be reckoned with... #primafacie #australianplays #australianculture #artsandculture #monologue #women #law #lawyers

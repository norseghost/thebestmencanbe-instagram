We all have a story and some of our stories have so much hurt and pain that they weight us down.. My weight goes all the way back to my childhood when at 11 years old I was victims of sexual abuse...rape.

I have never really discussed in detail with anyone all that happened to me when I was 11 years old because I have been to ashamed of it and thought if anyone knew the whole story they wouldn’t like me let alone love me. 
To say I felt lonely growing up would be an understatement.  There were many days I wished I was dead due to all the shame I felt. I never really understood why God allowed this to happen to me...I was just a  innocent child.

Still to this day I dont understand why this person would take my innocence and abuse me emotionally and physically like he did!

But what I do know is that it's time for me to stop carrying around this uncomfortable and emotionally challenging thing that happened to me as a child because I know its WEIGHING ME DOWN and it's time FOR ME to let it go TONIGHT!!!! #sexualassault #sexualabuse #metoo #rape #consent #abuse #survivor #saam #ptsd #believesurvivors #rapeculture #rapevictim #sexualviolence #healing #timesup #feminism #domesticviolence #feminist #support #cptsd #equality #believewomen #women #malesexualassault #whyididntreport #repost #awareness #mentalhealth #survivors #bhfyp

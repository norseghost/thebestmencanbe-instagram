The sad news from Melbourne today is an important reminder that we need to share our stories. This is not a unique situation. My own story is not exceptional and yet people are still shocked when I share it. Itâ€™s time to talk.
Itâ€™s time to talk so that other girls will realise they are not alone.
Itâ€™s time to talk so that they KNOW we will talk. 
Because if they know we are not afraid to use our voices then they will be too scared to use their hands. ðŸ–¤ .

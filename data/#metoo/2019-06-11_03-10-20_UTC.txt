I stand with Mariska for the millions of stories she brought to light, her fight to help survivors become empowered, for bringing together a movement that would change how we see sexual assault for not only us but for the next generations to come. For the hard work on shedding the light on the rape kit backlog, bringing justice to many perpetrators and closure to many survivors. 
I stand with Mariska because she saved my life in so many ways, I was in some of what I thought were impossible situations, and thanks to her and the amazing Joyful Heart Foundation, they have been able to help millions of survivors like me, this foundation that she brought from the ground up, her will to no end protect and literally serve for us. 
I stand with Mariska for her humbleness, her loyalty, her heart, her love, and her strong will that will make a mark society forever. 
I stand with Mariska for saving my life, for giving me hope when I felt I had lost it all, for helping show me the light at the end of the tunnel, and helping me and others prove that there is hope, there is a way out, there is a life beyond being a Victims and that we matter, that what we have gone through matters, and that we are warriors.

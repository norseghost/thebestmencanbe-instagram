We typically talk about child sex abuse in religious spaces on Sundays. So to keep in line with that and our current analysis of how predators gain access to children through the lens of Jeannie Mai's experience with child sex abuse, we are going to link a familiar scripture to our analysis.
The Bible says that wolves in sheep clothing will try to infiltrate the church. Well, so it is with predators within a family. They use their familial status (sheep's clothing) to gain access to the child for the purpose of their own deviant behavior (wolf).
Jeannie's mother said it best, "I was tricked!" Trickery and deceit, which we also refer to as masterful manipulation, are used by predators to gain the trust of both the parents and the child. This is why you can't be too careful in terms of how you monitor other people's interactions with your child, especially family members and friends. Letting your guard down based simply on perceived safety because of familial status can prove to be extremely dangerous for your child. We learned that the hard way, as did Jeannie's parents.
Remember, niceness is a decision, not a character trait.

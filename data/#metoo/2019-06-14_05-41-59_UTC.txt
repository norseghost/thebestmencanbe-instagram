We're just 1 month away from our first Love Necklace Campaign: Empower Her Session at Hope Haven - Belize where we will connect with a group of teen girls, talk to them about things to look out for in dating violence, and how to seek empowerment and support. This will be the first of many sessions that will teach girls things like yoga, mindfulness, and self defense. Click the link in my bio to learn how to get involved in the sessions👆🏻💞#love #empowerment #teen #support .

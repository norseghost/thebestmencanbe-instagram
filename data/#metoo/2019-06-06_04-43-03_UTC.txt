We represent all women in this country and have had enough. We will not neglect the issue of women’s rights being under attacked in a free country. No women can call herself free when she does not own and control her own body. Please help us spread awareness today and take action. For every like is a signed petition in a national step forward for restoring womens rights. For evey follow, we will personally donate $10 to The National Organization of Women. Lets take a step forward towards freedom for Women, freedom for all. •

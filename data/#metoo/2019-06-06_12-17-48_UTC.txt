Vision: To transform tragic places into healing spaces, illuminating the need for the WHOLE of humanity to Respect & Protect Women
SPARK the DARK Gatherings: We will illuminate significant locations with solar lights, transforming tragedy into hope & healing. The Gatherings will be symbolic events that will alter the essence of a space... so women can walk within it again - knowing that there is a living, breathing solidarity. This will also SPARK discussion & maintain the momentum of ‚Äòour voice‚Äô. https://www.facebook.com/SPARKtheDARKAustralia/

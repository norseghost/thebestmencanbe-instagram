This is Rosemarie Aquilina. She is the judge from the Larry Nassar case and easily one of the most phenomenal women who helped the #metoo movement. I am so emotional even speaking about her.
She backed up every single victim in the court room and gave sentencing that every child molester deserves. She makes me proud to be a woman.

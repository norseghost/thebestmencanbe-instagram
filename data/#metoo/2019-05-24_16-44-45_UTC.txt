Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not disputing the sentiment of this quote... in an ideal world. But we sure as heck aren’t in an ideal ‘women find it a bloody breeze to put their needs in the mix’ kinda world! ⁣
⁣
Plus ‘me too’ reminds me of how much we as women still endure and how much of what we have endured is still coming to light while many women are still enduring the delights of misogyny combined with as many isms as you could throw a stick at. ⁣
⁣
No, I think ‘me too’ is just not going to cut it for me...or my daughters...or probably my daughters daughters. ME FIRST feels like such an important statement for women because we’ve often been ‘me last’ for so long that we need to boldly, assertively, and givingnotafuckly move to the me first position and experience getting our needs met first before we can swing to a more middling position like me too. ⁣
⁣
As our EmBODYment challenge is coming to an end this month in the LemonAid community we’re looking ahead to June when we’ll be considering our self care and putting ourselves FIRST goddam it!! ⁣
⁣
If you would like to join our month of ME FIRST challenges, looking at why we might find it difficult to put ourselves first, dealing with difficult people, addressing guilt, our personal payoffs in putting others first (shock horror!), the consequences of not putting ourselves first and many a fine and useful discussion in the online community with other LemonAiders you can! Sign up link in our bio. ⁣
⁣
We run a different challenge almost every month and they throw up useful discussions and change aplenty! Check out our website for what’s coming up this year and beyond... ⁣

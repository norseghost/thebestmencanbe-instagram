I have exams in a week and I am stressing out. Some people treat me like shit and I don't know how to handle with it.

I miss my best friend, got flashbacks about my trauma, started disliking my body again and I can't stop thinking about cutting myself.

I cry a lot since a few weeks and I am really struggling.

Stay strong Warriors!

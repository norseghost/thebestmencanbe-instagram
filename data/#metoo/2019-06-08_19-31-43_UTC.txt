Sometimes I think about all the times as a teenager and young adult that I lacked access to voice and choice about my body‚Ä¶ being groped on the subway and standing in frozen silence, finding myself unable to stop a seemingly inevitable sexual interaction, knowing myself as asexual at the time but feeling sex was something that was expected of me in order to have a partner‚Ä¶ I think back to all these times and to the slow and sometimes painful journey out of dissociation and into greater awareness of and integrity with what my body wants and doesn‚Äôt want, a journey I continue on to this day - and I am grateful. Grateful for the sex work that gave me a place to feel confident in having boundaries for the first time in my life, grateful for the opportunity to become trained as a somatic sex educator and come into deeper embodiment, and grateful for the Wheel of Consent work I began this spring and will continue to do as part of a six month immersion beginning this fall. Why is it often so hard to even feel into what we want in so many areas of life - never mind honor and trust the feeling and then express our desires or lack thereof? ‚Å£

Conversations about consent often assume that we all have easy access to our ‚Äúno‚Äù or that we even know our own desire and I think for many of us, that‚Äôs not always the case. The Wheel of Consent is such a powerful tool for cultivating that awareness and practicing expressing it. I‚Äôm thrilled to be helping to facilitate a Wheel of Consent workshop here in NYC on August 5th and 6th with one of my teachers, @cocoloveblossom. The workshop is now more than half full so if you are feeling called to this journey I encourage you to have a look at the Eventbrite page in my profile and register soon. So excited to be bringing this work to the east coast and to share it with a few of you!‚Å£

“My Body My Rules.” The lack of access to safe and legal abortion is “a deprivation of the right to health,” according to The United Nations' Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Kate Gilmore. One of the first reasons why abortion was legalized in the United States was to prevent out-of-wedlock births, as many young, single women were prone to giving out-of-wedlock birth, leading to higher risks of low birth weight and infant death. There may also be a lack of financial stability to give birth and the individual may be vulnerable mentally or physically. Forcing these them to give birth may lead to child abuse and neglect if they actually do give birth without having the option to a SAFE abortion. •

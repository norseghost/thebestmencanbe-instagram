âž°Releasing Trauma Living with oneself. ðŸ•Š
.
For those of you that know me will know why I wrote this book. I was diagnosed with acute PTSD after my career in the police force. I used the healing energy of kundalini yoga to heal myself. Today I am a strong, happy woman who is thriving in life and takes each day as it comes.
.
Along side my seminars and retreats, I decided to write this book to help others. To realise there are not alone. To know that there are ways to heal and recover from any form of trauma. .
The book is linked in my bio if youâ€™re in need of some support. .

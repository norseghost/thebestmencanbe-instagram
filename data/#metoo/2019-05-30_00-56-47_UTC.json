                        "text": "\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdAlmost everyone has been raised to operate out of and value our masculine energy and use it to interact with the world around us. Most of us have a masculine operating system in place, until we do something about it, if we want to.\n\nThis is one of the reasons women struggle so much connecting with their feminine. They are using an old system and way of doing things that looks like it works for them. \u201cI swear it\u2019s giving me everything I want....one day!\u201d But the truth is they haven\u2019t actually experienced the feminine in order to see which one feels better to them, let alone to see how it can actually work in their life.\n\nAs we work with our feminine we are going to see exactly how much we were unconsciously operating from our masculine, usually shadow masculine, because it is about control. We have seen this unearthing happen with the collective feminine with things like the #metoo movement and discussion around consent.\n\nThis is apart of the unearthing of the feminine in yourself. As you go deeper you are deadass going to encounter a lot of things you thought worked or were acceptable to you, see them through a new feminine lens, and then get to make a choice about what operating system you are going to start using and when.\n\nGoing deeper into your feminine isn\u2019t all pumpin hottie booty dancing and Yoni eggs, although duh those are fantastic. It\u2019s also about consciously making new choices around the energy you are going to use, and sometimes that is going to be a challenge wrapped in hella resistance.\n\nBut that\u2019s good news, because when this happens you know you are getting somewhere gooooood. Plus that\u2019s always an opportunity to employ that booty dancing yoni egg action to help keep you moving in the direction you want. \ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffb #Repost @pvssyflowers with @get_repost\n\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\n.\n#womenwhoraisehell #sacredfeminine"

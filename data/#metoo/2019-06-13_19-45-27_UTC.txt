BIG NEWS Y’ALL— I’m official! I have my first published feature on a big web site!!! 🙌🏻 Can you help me get traction by reading it-- sharing if so inspired?  It’s all about #anger.

Yes, it’s about getting ANGRY.

I believe the suppression of female anger, particularly for #trauma #survivors, has caused women to disconnect from their emotions and thus remain deeply disconnected from true relationship, deep #forgiveness and #healing.

I think it’s time we made our truth known.

For the healing of all. 🌱

I had the most amazing night out ever last night with my best friend, watching another one of my beautiful friend's perfom a kick ass show with her group the Lady Killers. So much laughter and fun, it was so good to get out, sing and have some fun. Being a parent of a child with high needs, it is so important that you do get yourself out of your "normal" environment, go and have a laugh with some friends. I was so super lucky to receive this awesome unicorn card, with the most beautiful message in it, which gives me hope. Its been a very challenging journey of late, and I am super grateful to have some pretty special people around me, that are walking through this with me.

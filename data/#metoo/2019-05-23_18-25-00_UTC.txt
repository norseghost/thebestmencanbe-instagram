This is a post by ‘phoebe-does’, saying: “It’s okay to romanticise the small things about your day-to-day life. It’s okay to romanticise sleeping in, waking up to the sun tickling your skin. It’s okay to romanticise the texture of fingers against a page. Sometimes to safe your day You need to romanticise sitting at a desk and working, or romanticise studying hyped up on coffee. It’s okay to picture yourself as if You were the mc in a movie. Watch yourself go through shit and know that it’s just the climax of your own story, and that while You sit in your room sobbing to sad songs, good things are just around the corner. Sometimes to be okay or get through the day You need to romanticise the simple things.”

@havykgear is always coming up with ways to increase performance.  We use our sliders for trunk work as well. 
You cant help but watch someone with a slider in each hand doing ab wheel exercise. It comes with alot of grunting.

REPOST @crossfit.andalusia: Iâ€™ve seen the #QB fight and claw to get well into the end zone from 10 yards out, so @havykgear XL slider and @spudincstraps and @thompsonbowtie fatbells on a strand like Christmas lights was his pre-finisher today. Go @southeastern_savage_storm

YOU, brave girl, have a book inside you. And every single day you have the opportunity to pick up the pen & start a totally diff chapter. I mean fuck, if you want, you can just start a whole new BOOK. New setting, new cast of characters, new protagonist, new story arch… new everything.

If you’re standing on the edge right now, wondering whether or not you should leap, ask yourself… what would make the best next chapter? Or do you want to just stay in this chapter a while longer… talking about how you’ll start a new chapter one day… & how awesome it’ll be… but you never do it... #beabadass #podcast #girlpower #womeninbusiness #womenintech #ceo #womenempowerment #womenentrepreneurs #womensupportingwomen #womeninbiz #feminism #feminist #metoo #timesup #womenempowweringwomen #girlbosssa #girlboss #girlbossparty #savvybusinessowner #risingtidesociety #communityovercompetition #bandogirlgang #dontquityourdaydream #flashesofdelight #entrepreneurlifestyle #theeverydayproject #creativepreneur

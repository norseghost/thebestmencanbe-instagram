Top Factors That Impact Inequality At The Workplace 
1. Unequal pay -> according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, women earn 49 cents compared to every $1 men earn. Unlike other research, the new data considers part-time workers and women who have taken time off from work to shoulder the demands of having and raising children or other family obligations. More than half of women leave the workforce for at least a year, which is twice the rate of men.

2. Sexual harassment -> An obstacle that many women face in the workforce is sexual harassment. While the #MeToo movement has helped to shed light on the issue, little had been known, until now, about how many women are subjected to this type of mistreatment.
A survey conducted in January 2018 by the nonprofit Stop Street Harassment found 38 percent of women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace, and 81 percent reported experiencing some form of sexual harassment in their lifetime, including verbal or physical assault.
work-related factors can lead to an increased risk of sexual harassment or assault in the workplace. Women restaurant workers who rely on tips for their main source of income are twice as likely to experience sexual harassment. Women lacking legal immigration status or having only a temporary work visa are also at an increased risk of sexual harassment or assault.
3. Women Are Promoted Less Often Than Men -> One reason cited for why more women aren’t moving into higher-up executive-type roles is the lack of female role models in the workplace. Catalyst.org says that not having a visible role model can make women feel as if moving into a leadership-type role is simply unattainable. There has been an improvement in women role models within work and social media though, many women conquering the “social norms”. https://www.asyousow.org/blog/gender-equaliuty-workplace-issues

Today’s Monday’s Challenge is to make an upbeat playlist.  Go through your music collection and pick the songs that are upbeat and you can’t help but be in a positive mood when you listen to them.  Do so today.  That way you will have it ready to go the next time you have a low energy “bleh” kind of a day! 💜

The coverage of Cannes has ranged from high praise for the festival's evolution, to critique of the festival's handling of #MeToo and other inclusivity issues. But amidst the mixed reviews, there are definite wins for people like Gong Li, who just became the first person of Asian descent to win the Women in Motion Award at Cannes. Gong Li, whose long career in acting began with starring in the 1988 Chinese film Red Sorgum, has appeared in over 30 movies since, and has two more slated for 2020 and 2022. Meanwhile, I don't even know what I'm doing for dinner tonight. Props to Gong Li for staying on top of the game for over 3 decades. #WCW

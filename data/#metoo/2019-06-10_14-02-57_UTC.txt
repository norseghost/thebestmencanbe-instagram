I have created this page to share my journey and my experiences with people in similar situations as me.. people who are strongly affected by their past and their childhood and are often #misunderstood due to the complexity of the burden they have had to carry.... I am speaking for myself when I say.. despite the years between me and the traumas I faced as a child... I am still affected.. my relationships and my perceptions are too .. I am ready to heal.. I am ready to let go of the abuse and trauma that has held me back.... it will not be easy.. but this will now me my diary.. of my #journey to #freedom .... Join me if you like x

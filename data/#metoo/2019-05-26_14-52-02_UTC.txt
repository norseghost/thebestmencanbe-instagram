For those bashing #dietculture , shame on you. You shouldn't bash anyone for the choices they are making. Do you know why I am doing the #ketodiet ??? Bet not!
.
Because I have early symptoms of osteoporosis along with a binge eating disorder. I'm strengthening my mental health and physical health. And DIET has a lot to do with MY Body's success. I'm not influenced by magazines or models. I don't want to be them. I want to be the best version of myself. I also want to relieve pressure on my injured knee (which probably could have been avoided had I not been eating my feelings). I want a healthier body to carry a child. I want to be a mother so bad, and I refuse to jeopardize my baby's health due to my selfish glutinous lifestyle. Food is to nourish the body. I've been using it like a drug. Instant gratification.
.
Yes, weight loss is the main reason for #keto for me, but as you can see, I have many many MANY other reasons that are far beyond myself. I have developed healthier choices in all aspects of my life: I don't eat carbage all day in bed feeling ugly, I value water and veggies, I no longer drink alcohol from sunup to sundown, instead of snacking due to boredom I go to the gym or take a walk or read a book or sit in the sunshine!!!!!
.
I have noticed this hashtag #ispydietculture trickling into Instagram. Well, #ispy people who would rather go out of their way to criticize complete strangers, and during all of this #metoo and empowering women movements -- no one should spill their judgement to the thin, obese, chubby, flat chested, busty, bubble butts, hairy, keto, paleo, vegan, pale, tan, tattooed, OR fit and healthy woman.
.
All Women Are Beautiful. Not all are healthy, but as long as they are happy, then I have no reason to bash the woman who chooses to keep her rolls and curves, just like no one has the reason to discriminate me for wanting to shed heavy weight by cutting carbs.
.
And that's all....btw-- only 3 lbs away...

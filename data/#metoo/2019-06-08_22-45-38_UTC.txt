Be a light bringer... shine your light wherever you go... I think you really step into that power after you have suffered through a lot of bad shit and if you are able to heal, understand yourself and others who are not at all like you, as well as the gifts that are given to you in every trial you face, you become stronger and start to find your place in the world. Or maybe, then you start to make your place in the world. 
Blessings to everyone wherever you are in that path... âœ¨ðŸŒ  #nevergiveup #music #keepgoing #performance #artist #metoo #transformation #mezzosoprano #opera

If you haven’t read @frickleshnicks post about @ilovejuicebar’s actions towards her and other female employees, we encourage you to do that now.
If you HAVE read it, and you’re equally disappointed in their initial actions and follow up reaction - here are some other places to get your juice:
🍓 @javajuicebox - pictured. All local and all delicious on North Broadway. @emstooks is there... a LOT😂
🍓 @earthfare - there’s one in both Bearden and Turkey Creek. Not local to Knoxville but Asheville’s kinda close, right?😏
🍓 @nekterjuicebar and @cleanjuiceturkeycreek are both chains - but they’re pretty adorable and delicious chains so we’re not mad😉😘

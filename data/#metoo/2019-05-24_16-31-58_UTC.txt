Give me a 🙋🏾‍♀️ all the ambitious ladies!

We all know the workplace is still full of inequality which is detrimental towards women - everything from pay, to bias against female leaders, to women naturally needing more toilet breaks than men!

And yet another battle we have to face is being judged on why we got a promotion... 🧐Because she’s a woman and they are trying to get more women in leadership to prove equality
🧐Because I heard she’s sleeping with the boss
🧐Because she flirts with all the men
🧐Because she’s a bitch

OR maybe she was just the best candidate for the job. Maybe she worked her socks off to get that promotion. Maybe she studied harder. Maybe she worked longer hours to prove herself. Maybe she is a better leader. Maybe she spent time networking and understanding the business.

MAYBE the man just wasn’t as good?! #lifeaswomenknow #yourestillagoodwomanif #strongwomen #feminist #feminism #job #career #money #ambition #workhard #promotion #bossbabe #bossbitch #quotes #equality #empowerment #empoweredwomen #empoweringwomen #goals #girlpower #metoo

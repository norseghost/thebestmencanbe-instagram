Tbh I find it kind of funny how people brought up the idea of getting guys vasectomies and then reversed when they get married, and the first thing some people said was that it’s unfair to make someone’s body go through a procedure they don’t want in the first place. Like hmmm that sounds familiar... (Also I don’t think we should force vasectomies on guys, but I do think women should be allowed to have the choice to have an abortion if they want/need one)

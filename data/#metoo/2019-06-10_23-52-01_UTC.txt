HOW TO SAY NO continued:
.
1. Practice! Start with people you know well and situations that are low-stress (like going out to eat, deciding on a movie, etc.) try saying no to simple things even when you want to say just to practice having that conversation. .
2. Choose friends that respect your boundaries. That way you won’t have to keep explaining yourself and it minimizes the # of times you have to say no. Plus, are they really your friend if they can’t take a no?
.
3. Work on body language. Shoulders back, eyes straight and that “don’t mess with me” face. This is the one thing that impacts instances of sexual abuse - not clothing, looks, make up, or anything else. (This doesn’t mean anyone is “asking for it”; just that body language can act as armor if we practice) My therapist says to think of putting a forcefield around yourself before you go out
.
4. Remember you are not responsible for their reaction. Focus on feeling safe and respected rather than being “nice.” If they freak out, it’s on them, not on you. If it’s a stranger, you’ll never have to see them again! And if not
.
5. It’s okay to talk about things after the fact. Sometimes it’s still hard to think of a response on the fly and it’s okay to explain later that you have some boundaries you’d like respected. If it’s a genuine friend that you want to have a long relationship with, this conversation is an investment into your friendship
.
6. Put things in perspective. Other people may try to make it seem like whatever we’re saying “no” to is the end of the world, but remember they also have a life! People can be happy and productive humans with or without that thing that they absolutely need us to do
.
7. Simple is better. Use as few words as possible and don’t explain yourself. Over explaining can make you seem like you’re unsure of your decision
.
8. Repeat as needed! If someone keeps asking the same question, don’t be afraid to repeat the same answer
.
anything I’m forgetting that helps you?

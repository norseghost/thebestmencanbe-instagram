My ex #tatumstrangely is a @buzzfeed sponsored sexual predator on IG. confirmed by several woman.  I witnessed how he would take his phone into the bathroom and pretend to be “pewping” for 45 minutes as he dm’d any goth-looking chick with tattoos on his meme account. The universe cracked and let me see his DM’s one day... I saw that he was pretending to be single, childless, fun, and flirty on his IG (tatum.irl, tatum.strangely). Take a look at this pic and compare it to the selfies he flips/filters/photoshops and posts on his accounts.  Other women confirmed he stalked them, showed up at their house unwelcomed, stole their medication for his recreational drug use and lied about who I was for fear that they would talk to me and find out the truth about him and the “accident” he caused that almost killed me. Know who’s trying to find out where you live, ladies! #catfishing #memers #sexualpredators @buzzfeed #buzzfeed #tatumstrangely #metoo #catfish #predator #narcissist #narcopath

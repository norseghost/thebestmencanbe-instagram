Recently we had the opportunity to present a #definetheline workshop at a local high school. It was an incredible, sad, and inspiring session. ⠀
⠀
Sad because we walked into the school believing that we would be educating these students BEFORE they experienced sexual harassment - unfortunately that was not true. We heard story after story after story of the harassment they had already experienced. Stories of inappropriate comments, requests for a "pretty waiter/waitress", uncomfortable situations, and text messages from coworkers and supervisors that went too far. ⠀
⠀
But it was also an incredibly inspiring session. These students were willing to share their stories, to work together to talk about how harassment can show up in the workplace and eager to learn how they can define their own lines. We walked away knowing that these conversations matter. That we have to continue to have them, and that we need to start talking about this NOW rather than later.⠀
⠀
If you have a group of students that you think should have this conversation, please let us know (either in the comments below or by DM). We know just how important these conversations are and we're dedicated to making sure our young workforce understands that harassment is not okay. ⠀

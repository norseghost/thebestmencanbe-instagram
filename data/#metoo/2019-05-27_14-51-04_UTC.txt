When someone is being sexually abused, they often feel trapped and unable to tell anyone what is happening. Even years after the abuse, it can be hard to know who to tell about what happened to you. We recommend you find someone safe and share your story with them. Sharing your story can help you on the road to recovery. But who is safe? Here are a few qualities of a safe person: accept you just as you are and love you unconditionally (this does not mean that they should be overlooking harmful or toxic behaviorsâ€”accepting you does not mean accepting poor choices or damaging patterns); positively influence and develop your ability to love and be responsible (meaning they themselves are examples of how to love well and always take responsibility for their actions) ; give you opportunities and room to grow into the person you were always meant to be; always be someone you can be yourself around; show you how to balance living selflessly while also making time for self-care (self-care isn't selfish!) We hope you have someone safe to talk too. If not, we highly recommend a mental health counselor. #notjustahashtagpodcast

🚨 HAPPY WORLD MENSTRUAL HYGIENE DAY 🚨No menstruator should have to live without the menstrual hygiene products they need. PERIOD. Last year, 2 out of 3 low-income women could not afford menstrual hygiene products such as tampons or pads. So excited to have partnered with @makerswomen to amplify our work at @periodmovement to #EndPeriodPoverty.
.
In honor of the 28-day menstrual cycle, help us raise $28,000 to supply menstruators with the necessary period products to feel confident and clean every menstruation cycle, no matter their income. Text “GIVEPERIOD” to 44321 to donate this #MenstrualHygieneDay.

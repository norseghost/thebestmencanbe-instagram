[Trigger Warning: #AnimalCruelty]⁣

He was the owner of two beautiful animals, a dog and an affectionate little cat. It touched my heart because I felt that him having animals that he fed and cared for spoke to the nurturing aspect within him. But there were other sides of his personality that came out in his interactions with them. His dog was a large rottweiler and one day, when he did something LO didn’t like―perhaps getting into something he wasn’t supposed to, or going to the bathroom indoors after being locked inside all day―LO picked him up and slammed him against the wall.⁣⁣

Another time, the cat had sprayed somewhere in his bedroom and even he knew instinctively to hide from him. LO was angry and got more and more upset while searching for him. When he finally found him, he picked him up and whipped him across the room where he hit the wall hard and fell to the ground. LO advanced on him again but I got to him first, scooped him up and locked us both in the bathroom, crying as I held him. He was trembling. I wouldn’t come out until LO calmed down and promised not to hurt him. For some reason he found this amusing, calmed down and agreed to leave him alone.⁣⁣

I recall him laughing about how as a child he was found dunking newborn kittens in oil and flushing them down the toilet.  I found out years later that animal abuse, unsurprisingly, is a major red flag. “Studies have shown that violent and aggressive criminals are more likely to have abused animals as children than criminals who are considered non-aggressive.1 A survey of psychiatric patients who had repeatedly tortured dogs and cats found that all of them had high levels of aggression toward people as well.2”⁣⁣

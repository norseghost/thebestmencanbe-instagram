Reading “On Knowing My Body if Not My Own,” which came out in Nightjar Review last year. It’s one of my responses to the #metoo movement, especially in the way that living in a female body prevents women from being the owners of their bodies. Thanks so much for the organizers and to @thehouseofcoffi for hosting this lovely open mic! 🌺🌺🌺 #feminism #sexualassault #poem #poetry #femalepoet #womenpoet #poetryreading #sober #sobriety #harrassment #sexualharrassment #openmic #reading #sexism #floralprint #oldnavy #laritzy #redhead #ginger #naturalredhair #curlyhair

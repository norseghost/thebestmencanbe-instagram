I recently met a man, an attorney in his early seventies, and I learned that #metoo has passed some people completely by without as much as a tiny ripple on the surface of their world... I don’t know that many people in my business here in town yet and in a conversation I tried to lightened the mood and entertain a bit by telling a story that kind of made fun of me. In short, it’s about a choice I made  years ago regarding my relationship with the media in a case involving a young boy, the local media sharing too much information and a racist website. I got angry, put my foot down and even though I’ve had a few interesting cases since then, local media never contacts me. (For the record, information withdrawn but without any admission of wrong doing). I delivered the story to mostly laughter at my clumsiness. But this one lawyer JUST HAD TO GO THERE - he said he could fix my relationship with the media by booking a room with a couch for me and the male journalist in question for an hour ... if it isn’t clear, the subtext was of course that I was supposed to offer sexual favors to have my relationship with media repaired. Seriously.... I maintained my composure but on the inside, well I think the little dude in the picture says it all... #metoosweden

"The underlying driver of male violence is not biological sex differences (male hormones or 'brain wiring'), but the need to find and keep power. In the Western world, many men are taught from birth they have an inherent right to power – that boys are tough and strong and aggressive and have a right to anger, that girls are gentle and pretty and compliant; that emotional and domestic labour are women's roles, and men are violent, protective, providers and dominant. Even in the most balanced families, little boys see these lessons play out in the books they read and the movies they watch and the media constantly feeding into their subconscious. Sadly, this entitlement is even reinforced through church culture." saferresource.org.au/male_entitlement_and_male_privilege

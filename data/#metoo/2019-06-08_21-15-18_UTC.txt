I’m sitting here reflecting on these last couple of months when Pacey blessed us with her presence in this world 🌎

We’ve had so many hurdles to get over, and when I was going through them they felt like eternity.

Like when I was in excruciating pain with every latch,
when I had to stop feeding at the breast and exclusively pump,
when I had to supplement for the first time because she wasn’t growing as quickly as expected,
when I was pumping and feeding her the expressed milk,
when I was questioned about my supply,
when I questioned myself about my supply.... The list goes on and on..
And let me tell you what in those moments I felt like they lasted an eternity.

Looking back, now that I’m able to exclusively breastfeed my babes without pain, without pumping and a bottle, with confidence, with determination, while my baby is happy, healthy and growing this too shall pass Mama.

My wish for you:
Although it may feel like an eternity your struggles are short lived.
In the moment it feels overwhelming but you can do it!
We are all rooting for you no matter what you decide and will support your decision 🙏

It’s hard to believe that in only 2 short months I’ve been through so much and endured it.
These are the hard days but they too pass and new challenges will come.
But we’ve already been through the toughest of days, we can do this!

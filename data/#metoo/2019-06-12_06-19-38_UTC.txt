last night 3rd monthly Tokyo #flowerdemo in the rain. Now the demo has expanded to take place in 9 cities all over Japan. A safe and warm gathering to voice up and change society. Open not only to women but people of all sex and gender. Happy to see that 30-40% participants were male this time.
This gathering is about every one of you and those you care for.

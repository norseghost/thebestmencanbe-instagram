At the end of the day, power and money are all that seem to matter here in #Tennessee.

Join us next week in solidarity with our brave volunteers as they are fingerprinted and their mugshots taken for asking Governor Bill Lee to simply make a statement regarding the accused child molester #DavidByrd.

#EnoughisEnough Meet us outside the courthouse at 10:30am on June 21st to support these brave women and call attention to the injustice or their arrests while the real crimes in the #TNLeg are left unanswered.

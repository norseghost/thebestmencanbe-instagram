This is Mrs. Dolores.  She and her husband were our neighbors back at home in #Lafayette Louisiana.  When my husband and I moved to a bigger home, due to our babies being born, Mrs. Dolores was the kindest human being I had ever met.  She constantly checked on me, always went over the top to help me. Her husband was the greatest friend to my husband and helped us out tremendously when things needed fixing.  I was super excited to see them yesterday as they traveled to see us.  She showed me different flowers in my new hood that are healing plants and we walked down to the beach to view the sunset.  Mrs.  Dolores will always have a place in my heart.  When I came out about my #assault with the #healing #priest she provided an ear and her #arms with love and support.  I guess you could say she showed me that happiness and the belief that we can experience our own happiness, anytime and anyplace if we choose it.  I now have taught myself that our personal vision can be changed so that we think and see #god works for us rather than against us.  I also know that we can drop our self-imposed limits and stretch out to our infinite dreams. I am so glad they came to visit.  The little things that people do for you are the #sprinkles of #happiness we need to appreciate.

Oooooh this is a whopper of a topic for me. In this episode I tell you a lot about where I've come from and what I used to do to hide from my world and why that was a truly bad idea. It kept me from really living my life. I was hard wired to believe that hiding who I really am was the coping mechanism that I needed to employ, so I have had to work really hard to rewire my brain and do my best to show up for myself and to live as authentically as I can by being upfront and honest. But I have to say here that it's because I do all that reading, and I'm constantly learning. I have this podcast so that I can share what I've learned with you so you don't have to read the hundreds of books that I have. *

We are all constantly wanting to fit in somewhere and be a part of something, aren't we? And that's a great thing. It really is. But only when it's for the right reasons. Not everyone is meant to fit in everywhere, and each of us has our people. It's so so so important to not settle here. Because if you can't truly be who you are, then what? That's not an acceptable way to live.*

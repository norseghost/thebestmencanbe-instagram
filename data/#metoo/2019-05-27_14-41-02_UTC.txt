It is the only way to make sure you choose a president that cares about the American People and the real American Values that are Independence from foreign powers and lobbyists of Apartheid and big corporates, a president who stands up for Human Rights and Justice, a president from the hardworking people and for the hard working Middle Class and  those below the Middle Class people of the United Staes of America🗽🇺🇸.”R.F.

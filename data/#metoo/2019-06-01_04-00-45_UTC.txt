•• M A Y •• Meets June 
#Advocate #Idaho ————————————————————————
May may be coming to an end, but may we remember and continue to hustle, step out of comfort zones, and support those around us who need us.

If you or someone you know is living through an abusive relationship or situation, contact the accounts tagged on the first photo. I’ve worked alongside this organization and its members for years and trust them as a reliable resource. As an advocate, I’m here to listen & offer help — no judgement, ever. ———————————————————————— #Lifestyle #style #design #wellness #health #mensStyle #travel #discover #influencer #ootd #EndDV #graphicDesign #MeToo #styleblogger #May #TimesUp #spring

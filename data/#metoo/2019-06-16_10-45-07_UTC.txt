Word for this new week 'FOCUS'. #ablawomansays 
Reposted from @hernetworkonline -  Queens, as you settle into the new week, remember to stay focused on your goals.

What do you plan to accomplish this week?

Write it down and get about the business of making it happen. Dreams don't work unless you do so keep your head up, refuse to be distracted and stay focused on your focus.

I'm wearing our "Focused" T-Shirt available to shop via DM or visit www.hernetwork.co/shop.

Love & Light ðŸ’–

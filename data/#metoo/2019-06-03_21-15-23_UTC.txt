Hello, fellow feminists!
.
Laws on abortion are written by old, white men; Oscar nominees for the best director in 2019 were only men once again; there are basically no girls and/or women in tech and music videos and a myriad of films still portray women as objects.
.
You would think that #MeToo and #TimesUp would’ve impacted this society more. The fact that we learned even more about the abuse that women have gone through throughout our WOmankind’s
history should’ve initiated a fundamental change in our laws - or entertainment nominations at least. But they didn’t.
It’s awful that it’s getting boring to
rant about these issues.
How come almost nothing is changing?
Let’s  c h a n g e  this.
.
If you have anything to share about women’s role in society, equality or feminism, use the hashtag #OurDaughtersDaughtersSociety ✨
You can share photos of your favourite novels with strong, female characters or discuss how you’d love to see a female president in the US. Anything! Just use the hashtag so that we can have a platform where we can find all the posts related to these issues. And if you want, you can also join one of our DM groups where you can chat about the matters dearest to you even more.
.
So, read books by and about women, watch films with female protagonists, share current news about women and  d i s c u s s  everything. ♥️

Since gender inequality constitutes one of the history’s most persistent and widespread forms of injustice, eliminating it will call for one of history’s biggest movements for change. 
Women and girls continue to suffer discrimination and violence in every part of the world. Gaps in gender equality exist in every sector. 
In South Asia, only 74 girls were enrolled in primary school for every 100 boys in 1990. 
However, by 2012, the enrolment ratios were the same. In 155 countries, at least one law exists which impedes women’s economic opportunities. The gender pay gap costs global economy $160 trillion. 
Only 23.7% of all national parliamentarians are women. One in three women experience some form of physical or sexual violence in their lifetimes.

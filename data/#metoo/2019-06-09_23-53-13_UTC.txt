In case you missed it, I did a three-part series on #SexGetsReal podcast exploring polyamory's #MeToo moment.
.
In episode 261, I spoke with Eve Rickert about her experience of harm while in relationship with Franklin Veaux and how deeply so many of our communities are invested in celebrity culture. Whose stories get invisibilized?
.
In episode 262, therapist Samantha Manewitz joined me to talk about emotional abuse and gaslighting. It's a powerful conversation that everyone needs to hear. The ways we are all culturally groomed to gaslight and be gaslit are important to examine.
.
In episode 263, therapist and alternative justice expert Aida Manduley shared loads of valuable information and experience with us about community accountability, transformative justice practices, and why we need to grieve the myth of immediacy when it comes to justice and healing.
.
All three episodes are everywhere podcasts can be found and at sexgetsreal.com.

Policies and checklists are not going to fix this. We need people who have deep investments in harm reduction, conflict resolution, and in staying in community together." Eve Rickert

Elaine Frances Sturtevant (née Horan; The works of Elaine Sturtevant (known by her surname) cause a double-take; what at first looks like a painting by Andy Warhol or Jasper Johns is actually her own work, appropriating the forms and techniques of the original to a disturbing degree of accuracy. Since 1964, Sturtevant has appropriated the work of her male contemporaries to question the hierarchy of gender, originality and authorship, as well as the structures of art and culture. In fact, Warhol even acquiesced to let Sturtevant use his screen-maker to produce the same Marilyn screen that he used in his own work. As Sturtevant recalls, when Warhol was asked the details of his process he would tell people to "ask Elaine." #sturtevant #elainesturtevant #womanartist #femaleartist #feminist #womenempowerment #metoo #artsfemin #thegreatwomanartists #popart

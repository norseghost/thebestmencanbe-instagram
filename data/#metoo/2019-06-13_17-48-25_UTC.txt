Most of my uni friends are super sentimental atm cuz we’re graduating. And I’m having a really hard time trying to find a fuck to give. 
Last semester this huge #metoo movement burst open where a place that most of us saw as a safe space no longer was. All the people who were supposed to have our backs didn’t. They had been trying to hide all the cases that had come up, shaming the victims into silence. I tried to play my part and do something but it wasn’t at all fruitful. I’m still exhausted and recovering from all the emotional labour and manipulation and lies. And this girlllllll, Shayaan, she was president of the student council and she chose to do the right thing and as a result had to deal with the worst of it all. She did better than everyone getting paid/hired for exactly that. 
The only thing I’m grateful for is the people I’ve met. I am so glad I get to know you @shayaan.am I sleep better knowing people like you exist. You are so strong and amazing, I have nothing but love for you. You deserve all the awards.

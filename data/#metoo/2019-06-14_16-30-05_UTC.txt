Janelle Monae is a singer-songwriter and actress who is signed to @atlanticrecords and has her own label, the Wondaland Arts Society. As with many female artists who have been speaking about their experiences in the entertainment industry post-MeToo, Monae is vocal in her support for gender parity. At the 2018 Grammy Awards, she made it a point to say the following, - “We come in peace, but we mean business.”
“It’s not just going on in Hollywood, it’s not just going on in Washington, it’s right here in our industry as well,” she said. “And just as we have the power to shape culture, we also have the power to undo a culture that does not serve us well.” Thank you Janelle <3 Happy Pride Month!

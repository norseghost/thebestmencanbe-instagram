Rape and False Rape Accusation have become a big issue in our society. Almost everyday, there is a story of someone being raped and falsely being accused of rape. 
In the wake of the #metoomovement and the recent mini series on @netflix "when they see us" there have been conversations on if the punishment for both crimes should be on par with each other. 
We would like to hear your thoughts on this? Should a rapist and false rape accuser receive the same punishment from the law?

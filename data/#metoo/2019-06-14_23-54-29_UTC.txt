Wanted to share with you all my passion project that I'm in the very, very early stages of because it gives me tingles just talking about it!.
-
I've had the idea to put together a rape and sexual assault prevention program in high schools and I can't wait to see where it takes me ðŸ’—
-
My vision is to provide support, resources, stories, insight and strength to youth to change attitudes/ beliefs surrounding rape and sexual assault in order to be thought about differently and ultimately stamped out. So stay tuned Xx

The heightened ashkenazi security,\u00a0 restriction of movement of aboriginal, and humiliating treatment to which people are subjected, also deters many worshipers from coming in the first place. \u00a0This is choking the local economy and forcing these #Aboriginals into poverty, in a Muslim Quarter where 35 percent of businesses have closed  and those remaining open have seen their sales drop by up to 80 percent.\u00a0 Residents reportedly live in fear of their safety, and two 12-year-olds were placed under house arrest for throwing stones at security cameras.\nThere are about 350 #aboriginapalestinians in this section of #Jerusalem, also known as the \u201cAboriginals quarter\u201d according to the\u00a0Times of #khazar\u00a0 #Aboriginals have lived in the city for centuries, and the #African presence in Palestine dates back to the Islamic conquests, when Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab conquered Jerusalem in 634, according to\u00a0Al-Monitor.\nThe buildings they call home are 900-year old structures which became known as \u201cThe Blood Prison\u201d a century ago, when  #Ottomanempire converted them into a prison for jailing and executing the condemned.\u00a0 Those who live there today are descended from Muslim pilgrims from #Chad, #Nigeria, #Senegal and #Sudan who came to #Jerusalem and decided to stay.\u00a0 Their complex has grown into five apartment buildings, according to\u00a0The National, and some of the #Aboriginalpalestinians ."

I don't know how to say this, but The World is going thru a crisis, probably which we all are aware of but we just don't want to pay attention to it, considering the fact that "WE DON'T CARE, WE AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR IT." Let me break the ice for you, everything happening is happening because we let it happen. 
A three year old girl gets raped, brutally strangulated, by her own family members. Why though? BECAUSE OF MONETARY ISSUES. That little girl who couldn't stand up for herself, but others around who could've seen it coming? Why wouldn't they stop it? WHY WOULD THOSE TWO FAMILY MEMBERS DO THAT TO THAT INNOCENT? Does it not give you shivers when you hear such things? But we still let it happen. We all want this to come to an end, but how will this end? Who will end it? The answer lies in you. Start reacting to every sexist thing said to you, any racist thing said to you and ANY ACTION THAT MAKES YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AROUND ANYONE. 
@durgagawdestudio I SALUTE YOU FOR BEING SO BRAVE AND SLAPPING THAT GUY WHO CAN'T HANDLE A LITTLE PUNCTURE IN HIS *EGO* WHILE WE WOMEN ACCEPT HUMILIATION JUST SO AS TO MAINTAIN DIGNITY IN SOCIETY? what has the society ever even done for us women? The man who need to be punished is out there roaming freely, probably targeting someone else. The society supports the MEN and their wives can shut the fuck up and sit down to do nothing? The society will change IF WE LEAVE THEM W NO CHOICE. The world is full of selfish people and they won't stand up for us, but we women aren't against each other. We're all together, one huge family, we can rely on. Start standing up for yourselves and others too. People who need a voice are down trying not to make any noise about it. Help them out, start being kind, not out of sympathy but to make this world a better place for the upcoming generation of girls. Empower them, tell them they are the boss, and they'll show those men who can't handle the smallest of action against their biggest of crimes. .

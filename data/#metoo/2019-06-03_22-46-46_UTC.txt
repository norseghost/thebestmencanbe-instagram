from "Measuring #MeToo"

The study also found that accusations of sexual harassment and assault were very rare. While about one-third of respondents said they had committed one or more of the forms of harassment and assault included in the study, only two percent of men and one percent of women said that they had ever been personally accused of committing sexual harassment or assault. “This shows why any mention of so-called false allegations is so off base,” said Brian Heilman, Senior Research Officer at Promundo. “The evidence is clear that sexual harassment is real and it’s all around us, but sadly there are too few accusations of any type, since many survivors don’t feel safe in bringing these experiences to light. All of us need to demonstrate much better support to those who have experienced harassment and assault, to believe them if they choose to speak up and to help them receive some measure of justice on their terms.” msmagazine.com

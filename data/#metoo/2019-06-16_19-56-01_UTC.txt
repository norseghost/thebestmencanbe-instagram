It's been a long week of many ups and downs and the last 24 hours I've been extremely depressed.  But I think I've got to keep on pushing because with all the lows come all the highs and being greatful for all I have in life at this moment is something I need to focus on. 
I have wonderful friends, beautiful neice and nephew who adore me and I'm doing things I only dreamed of. 
Although I'm not where I want to be I am where I'm supposed to be. God has a plan 🙏🏻💟 #bpdblog #bpdhelp #bpdsupport #bpdblogs #bipolar #edrecovery #bipolartype2 #bpdblog #bpdlove #bpdcare #bpdreality #bipolarblog #bipolar2 #agoraphobia #zoo butterflies #nature #green #leaf #pray #godsplan #itiswhatitis #metoo #wetoo #depression #anxiety #mentalwellbeing #mentalhealthsupport #mentalwellness #wales

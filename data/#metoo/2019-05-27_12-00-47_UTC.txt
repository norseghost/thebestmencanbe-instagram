IDENTITY CRISIS 
By
BEN ELTON
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I haven’t read a Ben Elton book before and after finding another 3 in an opshop it seems that his books are mostly murder mysteries. I had no idea but what a brilliant backdrop to make comments about whatever era you are writing about.
This book is about a series of murders but that only serves as the canvas from which to dive into discussion about Brexit, Russians meddling in international political campaigns, transgender issues, Harvey Weinstein and the #metoo campaign along with everything that social media pings us with when we least expect it.
Fiction but very much based on the reality of now.
I loved it

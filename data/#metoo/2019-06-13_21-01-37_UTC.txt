This reminds me of @madblack65, who bravely stands up to share the story of being the victim of a horrific gang rape for the silent victims of sexual violence and abuse. Her book UNBROKEN is an incredible, harrowing but important read. She speaks for everyone who for whatever reason cannot. Tomorrow she'll be standing on the red circle at #tedxglasgow to face her fears and speak out about it again. I'll be there to see her. Good luck you beautiful, courageous, inspirational lady. Thank God for women like you ‚ù§ #metoo #empoweringothers #tedx #tedxtalks #unbroken

Balancing life, balancing work, balancing on one hand. .\nBut the thing is I\u2019m not ready to move on to a new prompt. I\u2019m not ready to balance my life and make peace with everything because I\u2019m angry. I was blown away by your comments yesterday. You shared your stories, your need for a solution. Although I knew that harassment is something that impacts so MANY women, online and offline, your shares made it that much more real. I\u2019m not naive, I knew it happens. Hell I\u2019ve been harassed by the head of a department and even when I reported it, HR handled it terribly and told me I should have been more assertive in telling him he was out of line. I\u2019m tired of blaming the victims. I\u2019m tired of being told that the only reason people work with me is because I\u2019m attractive and not because I\u2019m really damn good at my job. I\u2019m tired of having to block someone only to find that they\u2019ve been harassing someone else, because blocking is only a temporary solution and doesn\u2019t let them know that their behaviour should change. .\nI want to DO something about this! If you know of any resources, or any way of actually contacting @instagram I\u2019d love to hear of it! .\n#daretobe2019 .\n.\nAsana list:\n\ud83d\ude4f Thankful\u2714\ufe0f\n\ud83c\udf1f Proud\u2714\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udcaa Strong\u2714\ufe0f\n\ud83c\udf41 Humble\u2714\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udc23 Brave\u2714\ufe0f\n\ud83c\udf32 Balanced\u2714\ufe0f\n\ud83e\udd84 Express yourself\n#yoga\n#takeastand \n#armbalance\n#yogidandasana \n#grasshopperpose \n#yogavideo\n#yogatutorial\n#yogaathome\n#homeyoga \n#yogachallenge\n#dailyyoga\n#yogaliving \n#yogafit \n#strength\n#strongyogi \n#edwarrior\n#strongertogether \n#igyogacommunity \n#calisthenics \n#antibullying\n#metoo\n#harassment"

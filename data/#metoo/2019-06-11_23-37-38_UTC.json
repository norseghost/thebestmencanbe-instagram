Breastfeeding Henley was the hardest thing I have ever come face to face with and that includes natural birth and running a marathon 4 months pregnant! It broke me physically, mentally and  psychologically. I have battled with PTSD since I was 13 from being sexually abused by someone my family trusted. It has led me on a path of pain, darkness, insecurities, trust issues and brokenness for years but I finally took the advice I received from a very wise man of God, Robe, I needed to forgive, not for the man who stole my innocence sake but for me! I needed to release myself from the prison cell I lived in for so long. The world was lifted off my shoulders and I began to LIVE my best life. A life of worth, a life of beauty, a life of freedom. I moved forward from the trauma I faced until it was time to tackle breastfeeding. It was the first time in years where the flashbacks came back. The smell of his skin, the sound of his voice, the images that I truly never forgot. I questioned if breastfeeding was worth it knowing I was living my nightmare every time Henley latched onto my boob as tears ran down my face. But this story has a happy ending because I had a choice. A choice to let him once again take what wasn\u2019t his or take my power back! He took enough from me and I would be crazy to let him take this beautiful gift of bonding with my daughter. My PTSD still tries to creep in during these precious moments but I just have to breathe and look down to my beautiful little girl  smiling at me. #metoo #normalizebreastfeeding #postpartum #postpartumbody #breastfeeding #thisismotherhood #momtruth #childabuseawareness #abusesurvivor #teammotherly #forgiveness #choosereal #beautifullybroken #ptsd #empoweringwomen #everyonehasastory \u201cBeauty from ashes\u201d -Isaiah 61:3"

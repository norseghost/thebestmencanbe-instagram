I actually counted how many times I said “I’m sorry” today and in what situations. It got pretty ridiculous. Apparently as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, religious abuse, emotional abuse and trauma,  living with PTSD, I am not quite over saying “I’m sorry” just yet, but I am working very hard on this and becoming more aware. People who have endured trauma and abuse often feel the need to apologize for EVERYTHING. We were not valued or shown what real love was and therefore often feel like we are a burden, something is wrong with us that we need to apologize for, or we are taking up space that should be reserved for someone else. None of those things are true and is absolutely NO reason to be sorry! Although the “I’m sorry” saying may be deeply embedded in me, I am truly tired of saying it incessantly and I am working every day now to STOP 🛑 apologizing for my existence! You are allowed to be here. You are allowed to take up space. You are allowed to sneeze, burp, fart, pee, talk, breathe, eat, live, and ALL the rest. Sending lots of healing thoughts to anyone out there who is a survivor of trauma, abuse and have ever felt the need to apologize for nothing. You don’t have to apologize here. 💙💙💙

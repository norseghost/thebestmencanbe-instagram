My first experience of this that I remember occurred in my late teens. I was a fairly rebellious and independent teenager going through the usual angst growing up, coupled with struggling to understand events that I had also experienced. This led to quite a tumultuous time in my young life, a time I don't regret and I learnt a lot from I can tell you!üôÉ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
One of those times I write about in this article 'The Writer in Me'. I wanted to convey to readers how mental health difficulties can creep up unannounced, how they can impact a person't life in some areas, yet how we can also learn from them.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
The article also acts as a source of inspiration encouraging you that if something calls out to you, got for it! Explore it, try it, have fun!!!! If you haven't found something that makes your heart sing believe me there is something out there for everyone.‚†Ä

I hope you enjoy reading this short piece and perhaps you too can also reflect on aspects of your life that you now realise were impacted on due to mental health difficulties or other things going on in your life? While we may hold some disappointment about certain life choices we must not lose sight of the bigger picture; it happened for a reason and it has shaped us into the unique beautiful people that we all are üíú.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Wishing you all a wonderful weekend.‚†Ä

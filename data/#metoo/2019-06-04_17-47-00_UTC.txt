Having a conversation about how the #metoo movement is a survivor based movement, why we all are responsible for progressing the elimination of violence against women and girls, and what are the next steps. 
In Lebanon, there is an online tracker where women can log instances where they have been harassed. But there is stigma and shame. There needs to be a legal framework. 
This is an education issue in our schools so that our children know what it means to be sexually harassed and what to do if they have been.

                        "text": "As I listened to the rain falling this morning it felt like collective weeping for the international epidemic of sexual violence and the devastating trauma left in its wake. I thought about the tears so many survivors have shed as they try to pick up the pieces of a life shattered by abuse. I thought about the tidal wave of grief experienced not just by the families and friends of missing and murdered Indigenous girls and women but the unbearable burden of pain all Indigenous people carry from a country\u2019s devaluing and dehumanization of their people and refusal for so long to search for these missing mothers and sisters. I weep for the black women raped by their slave owners here in Canada and the generational legacy of trauma and invisibility \nand shaming of their legitimate rage. As the rain falls, I imagine the tears of girls and women forced into modern day sex slavery- human trafficking, in my own community. How far have we really come? How many of us carry the scars of an unwanted sexual experiences? How many of us are truly committed to challenging our privilege? \nDomestic and sexual violence happen at a much higher rate to women from marginalized groups. \nAs the thunder crashed, I felt deep in my soul the roar of love warriors everywhere \u201cENOUGH IS ENOUGH!\u201d\nUntil all of us are free, none of us are truly free. \nAnger is a powerful catalyst for change. \nToday I bowl for the @sascwr\nbecause they are doing the work to make this world a better place. Despite government cutbacks and an unprecedented increase in need for their services, under the dedicated and passionate leadership of @sarajcasselman they persist supporting, educating and creating innovative programs for women and men from an #intersectionalfeminist lens.\nPlease consider making a donation to this incredible organization (link in bio) and follow @sacred_mmiwg\n\nThank you and so much love to everyone persisting despite the traumas you\u2019ve endured.\u2764\ufe0f Nicole .\n.\n.\n#mindfulmama \n#consciousparenting \n#metoo \n#whiteprivilege \n#healers #psychotherapist #kwawesome #risesisterrise #vicarioustrauma #bethechange \n#whatnow \n#letlovelead \n#kindnessmatters #ibelievesurvivors #timesup \n#anger #changemakers"

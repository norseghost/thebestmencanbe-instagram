CHARLIE ROSE
CBS fired Rose after eight women accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. Since then, 27 more women have accused Rose of sexual harassment.

Rose’s attorneys contend that the accusers are exaggerating “threadbare” allegations in an effort to exploit the #MeToo movement.

Charlie Rose himself said he acted insensitively but that many of the allegations were inaccurate. AMAZING!

I wanted to share a quote that I love by Tim Allen. – “Dad needs to show an incredible amount of respect and humor and friendship toward his mate so the kids understand their parents are sexy, they’re fun, they do things together, they’re best friends. Kids learn by example. If I respect Mom, they’re going to respect Mom.”
And for WOMEN!
We can raise a generation of boys who respect women. So we no longer need to #metoo
Give a shout out to your man if they’re raising sons that treat women with love and respect! .

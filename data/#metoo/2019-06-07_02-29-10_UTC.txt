Just last night I finished a book I have been reading for the past 4 months. But tonight I finished this book in just 4 hours. Sure it was shorter. Not necessarily easier to read. The content was just as difficult to read about and the style of the writing was much more artistic. But some stories capture you more than others and this one had my full attention.  Blood Water Paint was a beautifully written historical fiction, and I hope others read it.

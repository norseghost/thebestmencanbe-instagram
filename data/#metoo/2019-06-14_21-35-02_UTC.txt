Allow space in order for inspiration to come in. With our minds so busy in this day and age it is easy to lose inspiration and forget to take time and space for creative thinking. It is so crucial for us as human beings to allow our creative energy to blossom. However, we are societally trained to always be busy, working, and have full schedules. Yet, science actually proves that when we’re “bored”, “chilling”, or have nothing to do, in other words “just being you”, is actually when our creative thoughts and inspiration begins to flow—it’s when we have our best ideas. This allows our minds to have the space to decompress and “daydream”. Studies show the brain makes its best connections when relaxed, allowing us to seek deeper meaning and satisfaction. So next time you feel uninspired, burnt out, or mentally built up—just slow down, release, and take some space to just relax and let your mind wander. You’ll be surprised what’s really in there! Listen to the whispers of the universe... Finding deeper meanings and making connections will lead you back to your inspired self: fulfilling your true purpose here on earth! ☝🏽🌎🙏🏾

Well that went well. It was an extraordinary congregation of keen allies, friends, and sisters in a perfect space @thegardenstrathcona for tonight's SHE(BITES) launch. You met the minds behind the helm - Mandalena, Sam & David. You heard our grand plans to support women, share untold stories, and take on apex #Metoo predators - powerful corporations and institutions. We will agitate the status quo and show up for women across the board. Tomorrow our reckoning goes Live. Don't forget to tune in for your daily hard hitting #Metoo news & commentary at noon every day at www.shebites.ca! Followed by a week's worth of web stories, video journal stories, and For The Record podcast interviews - oh my! Get rest tonight because tomorrow we're starting the Revolution. ✊♀️🐺🎙📡

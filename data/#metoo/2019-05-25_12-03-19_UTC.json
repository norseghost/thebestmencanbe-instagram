And, for many of you, the world isn't merely frenetic and blurry, it's gotten very, very dark and all-consuming. Today, we hope you can take a moment to just notice all the things around you that are okay. That are calm. That are exactly where they belong.\n.\nTake a moment to feel that stillness. Notice your heart still beating. Feel your lungs still breathing - in and out.  Take that deep slow inhale they've been craving. Feel the gentle sensations along your skin -- every cell responding to small traces of air and fabric brushing against it. From life-sustaining breath to the goosebumps on your arm, each part of you is still going. Still fighting. Still strong and doing all that it can. For you.\u00a0Notice the strength you've exercised in the face of all this commotion and hurt. There have been so many days you thought you couldn't do it, and you have. You are doing more than fine!\n.\nWe hate that you have to fight so hard, but we SEE your strength. \u00a0We're with you, fighting beside you and FOR you.\u00a0You're gonna be okay.\nStay in this a moment a bit longer before just scrolling along again.\n.\nNotice your breath.\n.\nNotice your heart.\n.\nNotice the person you are.\n.\nNotice the strength inside.\n.\nYou're still here. You've got this. You're okay.\n.\n\ud83d\udc9a\ud83c\udf32\ud83d\udc9b\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#complexptsd #cptsd #ptsd #dissociation #dissociativeidentitydisorder #DID #OSDD #BPD #trauma #traumainformed #survivor #childabuse #sexualabuse #humantrafficking #metoo #mentalhealth #mentalillness #mentalhealthawarenessmonth #selfharm #eatingdisorders #depression #disability #recovery #healing #therapy #wellness #mindfulness #meditation #deepbreathing #hope"

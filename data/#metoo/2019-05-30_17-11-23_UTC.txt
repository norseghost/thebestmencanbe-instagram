“Then What is my Option?” By Coryn Catanzaro “Coryn’s project, which she calls Then What is my Option?, was inspired by a Chicago surgeon, who in 1908 put together a medical journal full of cases of injuries and fatalities that occurred when women could not seek an abortion by a doctor. Coryn took the same approach with her project, and researched the more recent dangerous methods that many women resorted to before Roe v Wade was passed, and even more recently. The perfectly sculpted hands hold the barbaric “tools” that have been recorded as being used to induce an abortion. The photos are startling, but that’s Coryn’s intention. She wants people to know what’s at stake should abortion be made illegal again. “Let’s not allow congress to make this a reality for women in the United States again.”” Follow us @dallasactivistclub - -

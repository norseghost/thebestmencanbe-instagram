When I saw this written in a bathroom stall at #utaustin, all I could think was how sad if this is the only place this person could share what happened to them. Or maybe itâ€™s just a reminder that women need to be advocated for and supported in the right ways. So for this anonymous person and all other women who have dealt with this, do what you can to support the women around you. #metoo #metoomovement

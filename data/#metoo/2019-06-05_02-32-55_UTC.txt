Looking back through my journal entries six years ago, I stated several times that I was "so ready" to be done with the whole process. I wanted to rush the process, but knew that it would only take place on GOD's time. Six years later, I reflect on where I was 2013 and where I am now. I can truthfully say that entire process gave me the strength that I have today!

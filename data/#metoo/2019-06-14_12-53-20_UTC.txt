.let’s shine a little light, let’s share some knowledge on this Friday, as we are getting ready to go out and enjoy our weekends, hang out with friends and do summer hoe activities! Please read all the statistics on these pictures that I just shared, there are so many more factors and statistics that go into this, I just shared a couple. In society today this is the ugly truth. This can happen to your mom, your brother, sister, friend, cousin, or the person sitting next to you at the movies or bus. Let’s all be kinder to one another because we don’t know the struggles they might be facing. With all this being said, me as a woman, I am a woman myself I should not! We should not feel guilty for this happening to any of us. Women shouldn’t feel like they can’t speak about this, we shouldn’t feel embarrassed or question ourselves and what the world is going to think. Fuk the world! We shouldn’t feel guilty because we chose to go out, because we decided to trust the fukin people in our lives! We constantly live in fear having to take extra care of ourselves and those around us and society wants to blame us?! Are you serious? Did you willingly go there? Did you willingly have a drink? does it fukin matter? Did I ask to be roofied? To be sexually assaulted, to not remember? This needs to be spoken about, this needs to become a bigger issue because often times women and men retrieve into silence because the people closest to them don’t know how to help because this is so taboo! Speak up for the next victim. Enjoy your weekend, if it happens to you (which I pray it never does) don’t be afraid to speak up! And to you who does this type of low life shit, think about how you would feel if it happened to someone close to you. #awareness #girlslikeus #rapeawareness #metoo #yesallwomen

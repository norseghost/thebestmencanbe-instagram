#Oscar winner #cubagoodingjr surrendered to New York authorities on Thursday following allegations that he groped a woman at a #Manhattan nightclub over the weekend, according to the #NYPD

The actor was charged with one count of forcible touching, a misdemeanor offense, said Det. Sophia Mason, a spokeswoman for the New York Police Dept.

Gooding turned himself over to the NYPD Special Victims Unit Thursday afternoon where he was processed. He was fingerprinted, had a mug shot taken and was led out of the precinct in handcuffs, the Associated Press reported. He is expected to be arraigned later in the day.

Earlier this week a 29-year-old woman told police that the actor grabbed her breast while he was intoxicated around 11:15 p.m. on Sunday at the Magic Hour Rooftop Bar & Lounge, according to AP.

Gooding and his defense attorney, Mark J. Heller, have denied the allegation. “We have reviewed almost two hours of tapes, and we do not see any criminal conduct having been perpetrated on his part,” Heller said in a phone interview with The Times.

His surrender on Thursday came just hours after local tabloids reported that a second woman came forward with a separate groping allegation against the actor in 2008.

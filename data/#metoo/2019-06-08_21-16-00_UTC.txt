⠀⠀
This is the question I asked people as they were attending what we call in Sweden a ”Kosläpp” which can be translated into “The releasing of cows”. In short it is an event filled with propaganda to make consumers feel content with their choice to enslave, abuse and ultimately murder cows for the sake of their palate pleasure.⠀⠀
⠀⠀
I went there not to demonstrate this particular event at this particular farm but rather to demonstrate the exploitation and abuse of animals and try to spread some truth. Because the truth is that calves are separated from their mothers! The truth is that male calves cannot produce milk and are therefore killed! The truth is that dairycows are sent to slaughter, hung upside down and have a knife slashed across their throat! The truth is that we have no dietary need for cows milk just as we have no need for dogs milk, cats milk, rhinos milk, giraffes milk or elephants milk! The truth is that the only milk we need is our mothers milk! The truth is that we are grown adults who are still breastfeeding! The truth is that we are not baby cows! Let us stop acting like we are and face reality! Cows milk is for baby cows!⠀⠀

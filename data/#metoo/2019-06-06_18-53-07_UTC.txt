*What stories inspire you to take action?*
After the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings, Adria, a lawyer who dedicated her career to representing victims of domestic violence, attended a conference w/ Hill and 2,000 women who all wore t-shirts emblazoned with the words, “Women Tell the Truth.” Today, as women’s stories are regularly disbelieved, it is more necessary than ever to nurture a circle that will stand strong in the fight for gender equality. We need every woman to become a part of the circle.

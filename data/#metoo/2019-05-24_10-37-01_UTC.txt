Feels and truths: trauma healing is really hard but I'm doing a good job.
---
I had difficulty sleeping last night--assualt flashbacks--but I did a good job calming myself down and pulling myself back to the present. I focused on my breathing and got back to sleep.
---
I was really tired today. I spent a couple of hours knocking out little work things, like organising my emails and following up on project deadlines. I left the house to get something for the office. That's a good job.
---
I got a foot rub because it's safe touch that makes me feel relaxed and in my body. I bought chocolate and nail polish just because I wanted to be nice to myself. ---
Some days it's like that: really, really hard and full of small celebrations and gentleness for myself. I'm posting this because I talk a lot about positivity and vulnerability and I guess I just want to walk the talk some days. Truthfully, I'm terrified to open up to people in my life about what's happened to me. I get scared that I'll be judged if I share my story, and I feel guilty for feeling like I'm living in victimhood. Some days I feel like I'm barely keeping it all together.
---
So here's me today: I've been hurt and I'm healing. It's really hard but I'm doing a good job and I'm getting help from professionals and friends. I know I'm not alone. ---

Some sort of weird goth Jumanji bs I don't even know, man

On another note, I'm heading home on Thursday for my college reunions and I am so fucking pumped to see everyone! It's basically a four day party where the entire campus gets cut off from the rest of the town via all these gates that get set up. Historically this event is the largest beer order in the United States behind the Indy 500, which means things get a little disgusting by the last day. I was in the hippie eating club, so I'll be spending a large chunk of my time vibing to good music back with my peeps. There's been shit going down on campus though about how my school handles Title IX, so I'll also be protesting a #MeToo panel where they effin invited Brett Kavanaugh's lawyer, can you believe it?

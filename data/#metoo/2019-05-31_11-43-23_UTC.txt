During an episode of "My Next Guest Needs No Introduction” with @letterman, comedian and host of @theellenshow, ‪Ellen DeGeneres‬, bravely spoke about being sexually assaulted as a teenager by her stepfather. Ellen goes on to discuss how she kept this abuse a secret from her mother for years before telling her what had happened. When Christine Blasey Ford told her story before the US Senate during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, Ellen said, "As a victim of sexual abuse, I am furious at people who don't believe it and who say, 'How do you not remember exactly what day it was?'" she said. "You don't remember those things. What you remember is what happened to you, where you were and how you feel. That's what you remember."

We applaud Ellen for bravely coming forward with her story and hope other survivors are empowered to speak out!

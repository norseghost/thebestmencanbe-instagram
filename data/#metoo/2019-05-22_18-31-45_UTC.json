These bans are about controlling populations who threaten the wealthy white patriarchy \u2014 women, people of color, poor people \u2014 and preserving an underclass of wage slaves. They\u2019re intended to suppress our economic, political and cultural impact on our country because they fear what they believe about us. They fear that we would treat them the way they have treated us.\n.\nBy forcing women to have babies they either don\u2019t want or can\u2019t care for, we condemn future generations to a cycle of poverty, exposing families to higher rates of homelessness, addiction, abuse, neglect, malnutrition, violent crime and other social ills that researchers and social workers have observed for decades. We smother an economy that increasingly relies on diverse voices coming together to innovate and grow the value of our goods, services and markets.\n.\nGranting women equal rights under the law and the freedom to make our own reproductive choices inevitably leads to consecrating the definition of what it means to be a person in this country. And our government\u2019s track record on this is dismal.\n.\nAny law or amendment that recognizes our reproductive rights naturally leads to the need for legal definitions of many other issues that politicians have avoided for decades: our right to equal pay for equal work, our right to healthcare, our right to use our own bodies to provide for ourselves.\n.\nEnshrining our human rights into law means relinquishing power over us. Defining our value as human beings means including us at every level of society and sharing with us the profits they are reaping off our backs. #hysteriaseries\n.\n.\nFeatured: @mouthygoddess\nPhotographer/CreativeDir: @rachaelthompsonphoto\n."

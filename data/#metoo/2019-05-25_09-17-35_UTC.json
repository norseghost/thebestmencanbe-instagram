                        "text": "Disservice #1 Not letting someone tell their own story: The woman in the first audio said only parts of her story were presented in the recording. Parts that served the story YOU wanted to tell and not HER. If she was an actual victim of sexual violence (the woman has posted her own video saying that she is not a victim of Tony Robbins, and the article does not display her story (disservice 1.5)), it is CRUCIAL to the healing process that she tells her story how she wants to and not how someone else wants to. If the true concern was to help her, the story she spoke of would have been published and not the one that was written. @ericedmeades published an article on @medium going into further depth on the poor journalism presented. \n#\nDisservice #2 Decreasing Victim Credibility: These articles are going to make it more difficult for targets of sexual and domestic violence when they come forward. Since some of the people named in the articles have come forward saying their truth is something other than the words published in the articles, it\u2019s going to make it much harder for someone if they do wish to press charges because there\u2019s already been \u2018false evidence\u2019 presented. As someone who spent three years going through the legal system, it\u2019s hard enough to get through a trail without external factors making it more difficult. Do a favor for the sexual violence survivors who are or will go through the judicial system and leave the investigating to the legal professionals. \n#\nDisservice #3 Hindering Progression: In order to make progress on abolishing sexual violence in our society, it needs to be humanity versus sexual violence. Not women versus men versus sexual violence. WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER. We need to create safe environments where people can talk, heal, and understand. By accusing Tony Robbins in such a manner, it\u2019s going to make more people feel worried or unsafe. We need people to be educated about sexual violence, not scared that they can get wrongly accused or that their story won\u2019t be presented in the way that they need it to be. \n#\n@buzzfeednews before you publish your next article, please consider the impact of your actions."

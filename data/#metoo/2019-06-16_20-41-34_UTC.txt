Memories of January 2018, recording our album in the studio with @sunerosewagner. We wrote a rocking guitar progression, Sune added some crazy big drums and effects and it was time for Michelle to lay down some vocals.... She scribbled these words on a paper as Sune and I were working on the music... We had no idea how powerful the words would be. She sang the song and the two of us were a bit taken aback by the energy and emotion in the vocals. As she was singing, i could tell... She wanted to say more, i could feel her anger... In the middle of the take, i took the lyric sheet from her and scribbled the words in blue pen at the bottom and she sang them... The song just came together in such an organic way. It is a female power song. It is a song for women who watched as men got off after abusing women. Its a song for those who want to express their anger.... But have no legal ways to do it, particularly when laws are not yet designed for women who are abused. #lyrics #women #metoo #ottawa #metal #photography #indiemusic

One of the most liberating things I have done in my life is to separate my choices from my responsibilities. I used to think that anything someone else expected if me was a responsibility. I spent my time and energy making other's lives easier to the detriment of my own.

Unlearning it has been a process of the pendulum swinging from self sacrifice to selfish and then finding the place right between that makes life flow.

I have the right to determine what is important in my life and set boundaries to prioritize that. No one fulfills their Dharma by letting others dictate their responsibilities. 
That doesn't mean your responsibilities can't be of service to others, only that it serves you as well. Otherwise it is just enabling and disempowering.

My favorite way to serve is to partner with nonprofit organizations that bring hope and relief to our communities. I loved helping the team of champions at Refuge and Riverbend Family Ministries set up for the Annual Build A Refuge Dinner in April. The work they do to protect the children of Madison County is absolutely enthralling! ðŸ’™ #MissIL19 #missilmonday #MAO #AutumnAgainstAssault #NOMORE1in4 #MeToo #Service #protectinginnocence

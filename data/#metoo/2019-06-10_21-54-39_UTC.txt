The RSF/Janjaweed mercenary thugs led by General Hametti are reported to have raped 48 women (including doctors) and 6 men during the violent and brutal clearance of the peaceful sit-in at the Military HQ in Khartoum on 03/06/19. The death toll currently stands at over 100 with over 40 bodies recovered from the Nile where they were thrown with rocks tied to them. This systematic campaign of rape is a weapon of war utilised by the Janjaweed since 2003 during the Darfur genocide, it has been described as ‘genocidal rape’ where children and even babies are also victim!

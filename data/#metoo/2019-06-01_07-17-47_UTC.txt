Happy Pride Month guys!! I was thinking I’d dedicate your post to more lgbtq+ posts this month, and I usually get more feedback/interaction in lgbtq+ posts, so that’s my plan! I’ll definitely make sure to still post on the important events that happen. I’ll also be getting around the huge issue with the killings of black trans women that keep going unnoticed! ————————————————————————————————————————————————-

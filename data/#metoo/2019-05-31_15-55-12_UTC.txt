Day 3 of my partial hospitalization. I've finally woken up on time!!! But I'm tired 😴 .

Wish me luck as I try to work towards recovery! .

I want to look forward to a time when I'm healthy and back to teaching and researching violence using math. Until then I will take things 5 seconds at a time. If I can get through those 5 seconds, then bring on the next 5. .

If you or a friend are also on a healing journey drop a ✊🏽. Or if you have any questions about PTSD or my kidney Sicario-I'll answer what I feel comfortable with. .

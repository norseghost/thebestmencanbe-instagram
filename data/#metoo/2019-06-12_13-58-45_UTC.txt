Posting again just so I can tell anyone who takes the time to read these captions that I discovered “what’s the pressure” by @lauratesoro and its A BOP😍 if you can’t be bothered reading my long and most likely meaningless life update, please just make it to here and go listen to the song
✨✨✨✨
Mental health wise now, I’ve been digging my way out of this fucking stupid relapse and my head is back in the game🏀 I have a psych appt coming up soon and it’s a diagnostics evaluation, and let me add here that I am always under evaluation so I don’t know why this is necessary but I’ll go with the flow🙃 I aced all my major papers and I’m getting ready to celebrate aka waste my money on cocktails I shouldn’t be buying🍹

Hope everyone is having a splendid week 💗
-Addy✨

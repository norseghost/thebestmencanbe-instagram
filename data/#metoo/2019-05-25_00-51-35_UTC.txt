Suicide on college campuses is more common than we think. I've helped students get they need but I could not recognize the signs in myself. 💪🏽 My whole life I've been called strong. Wether is bc of my health challenges or my rape and sexual assault and their respective physical and mental disabilities. 👩🏽‍🎓 Last year I left @ucberkeley and transferred to @arizonastateuniversity for a safe space to develop my work. Little did I know I had transferred to work with incredibly abusive supervisors. I tried keeping my head down and developed really cool research projects but things only got worse.

A little over a month ago I survived a suicide attempt. It was the culmination of daily abuse. To say I'm heart broken isn't enough. I LOVE being a mathematician. I love being a researcher but #mathematics was not a space built for me and being in this space almost killed me.

For now I'm taking a sabbatical from school to focus on fighting to live. I'll be trying to find who I am outside of mathematics. If any homies are down to help me in my recovery-I can def use the help. I can't do much yet but I like watching baseball games and hiking. 👩🏽‍🔬 Please reach out to your strong friends. The ones you admire bc they've been through so much. Let them know they have someone they can count on.

There is myth I been 
feeling in my heart
like some kind of 
urban legend 
waiting to be proven right 
Stratocaster, what the Hell is that?
I don’t care for gear talk
I just wanna play my music at 
all the places I want 
I am unbroken 
but blocked by
man….yeah, me too 
muddled, unspoken 
words, 
I got them me too blues 
I got them me too blues 
Like brick to mortar, 
it’s been a tall order
building my throne 
Ain’t no tricks
under my hatband, 
I’m more than enough 
on my own

Yeah, I got me a good one,
Yeah, I married the best 
But now I need a Resurrection 
from all the rest 
I am unbroken 
but blocked by man
….yeah, me too 
muddled, unspoken words, 
I got them me too blues 
I got them me too blues

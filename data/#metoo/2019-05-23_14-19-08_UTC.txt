Happy Book Birthday to #MeatMarket by @junodawson ðŸŽ‚
__________
Jana Novak's history sounds like a classic model clichÃ©: tall and gangly, she's uncomfortable with her androgynous looks until she's unexpectedly scouted and catapulted to superstardom.

But the fashion industry is as grimy as it is glamorous. And there are unexpected predators at every turn.

Firstly let me just say, this is a book i had high hopes for. I loved Clean by Juno last year, i love how gritty and insightful her writing can be. Meat Market was so much more than i expected. I loved every page of this book, i couldn't put it down.
__________
I rated this book 5/5 stars!

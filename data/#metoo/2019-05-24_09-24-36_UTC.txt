“Pain is an easier narrative for women to fit into than pleasure” 🌸 “I want to explain all the places trauma feels trapped and all the places there is freedom, liberation”

This guest blog on the lovely @neonmoonco explains some of our motivations for starting Project PleasurAble. Link in bio 💕

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions as we develop the project our DMs are always open 💌

[trigger warning ⚠️] Yesterday, a man was blatantly masturbating on the train I take to work. For no less than 22 minutes, I sat uncomfortably as he touched himself while moaning and whistling. Eventually, another male passenger approached him and asked him to stop which resulted in a verbal and somewhat physical altercation between them. The man was removed from the train at the next stop. I’ve been thinking about this situation over the last 24 hours—how uncomfortable I was & how confronting the man never entered my mind, mainly bc I felt unsafe. Moreover, this behavior can be a precursor to sexual assault (check pyramid). We live in a society so deeply engrained in rape culture, it permeates our media, presidential office and even our commuter trains. Thnx to the dude who stepped up to confront this man—I see you 💕 #rapeculture #metoo #survivor

Today I'm quoting from @unbelievablyhuman Liv's luminous post about her struggle with meditation.  Meditation has never been so simply explained to me before this. Was just talking about how listening to someone is the nicest gift you can give them. But it's actually the nicest gift you can give yourself too. Always thought of meditation  as something that was good for you, like celery stalks or sit-ups. Thanks to Liv, setting aside time to meditate or to listen to myself actually sounds desirable now, like dark chocolate.

Take a deep breath in and breathe out they say. That way things won’t turn out that way. You won’t be a victim again you deserve gold but you collect dust and the ashes that come from the fire within. I will never be the victim again. #metoo #domesticviolence #mentalabuseawareness #1in4 #suicideawarenessindepression #bipolar #pregnancyloss

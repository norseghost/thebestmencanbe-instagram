Subtlety by subtlety, she will be judged into a tiny box of same and regular, taught to be ashamed of her very nature\n.\n\nThese white girls that surround her will enjoy the entirety of their emotionality, sex, pain, recovery, passaging through to become Doctors, lawyers. If she wants to meet them there shell have to bind herself, a complete cancellations of experience, posturing a modesty, lest they add \"ghetto\" to her becoming\n.\n\nThere is a neurology behind this, the development of the prejudice network, a map of brain regions, inclusive of the amydala, the prefrontal cortex and the hippocamps, its here where ideas of \"in\" and \"out\" group preferences are forming *exactly* at the age of the dancing girls, which, to this little Sunbeam, will simultaneously begin to dysregulate her HPA-axis, the neurophysiological stress feedback loop\n.\n\nAs she learns she is in the \"out\" group, she will begin to idealize whiteness, coupled with the internalization of her (non-existent) inferiority; steroid hormones will spill from her adrenal glands into her blood stream, cascading to the brain, where she articulates her \"otherness\", attaching confused emotions to the scant word bank of a small child, priming her mind for affective disorders\n.\n\nSuicide rates for black children, ages 5-12, across class, are twice tht of their white counterparts. Why? Hegemonic messaging imprints racialized primacy as early as 18 months, timed with the greatest synaptic density evolution the brain will ever see; by age 3 the brain has grown to 80% of the adult volume\n.\n\nIts unnatural to grow smaller, more limp with time, but because prescriptive cultural uniformity, contextualized by white mediocrity, we all learn to live on our knees so \"Karen\" can stand\n.\n\nfucking disgusting\n.\n\nAll this baby is doing is keeping time in a world where everyone can't find the beat"

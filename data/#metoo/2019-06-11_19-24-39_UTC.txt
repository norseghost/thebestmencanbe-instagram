A common argument that I hear for keeping abortion legal, is that it is anti-women, sexist, or that men shouldnâ€™t decide what happens to womenâ€™s bodies. However, when one looks closer at the facts, a larger amount of Republican women actually support abortion than men in the Republican Party. The problem is that the people that use this argument donâ€™t take into account the intentions of the majority of pro-lifers. It is not to limit womenâ€™s rights, which makes no sense according to the statistics, but rather it is the protection of an innocent life. It is very important to not make assumptions for people with opposing viewpoints, especially when those assumptions donâ€™t align with the facts.

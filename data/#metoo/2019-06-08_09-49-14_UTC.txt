The last thing i don't want to do as a mistake is to form a relationship with the typical ignorant but well educated women of these corporate world conditioned societies.

Simple and clear. ðŸ’¯

All these corporate propaganda agencies led women's right or empowerment movement is doing nothing but harm to the humanity in the long run.

A women who is clueless of her own innate powers and weaknesses is a dangerous women.

Be mindful and choose wisely.
Not all you call your family or friends may not belong in your inner circle.

Last year, the #MeToo movement did many things: from highlighting toxic workplaces to sexual misconduct, to how to take legal action against the perpetrators. But # MeToo also received endless backlash and mockery, including from celebrities such as Pooja Bedi and Alok Nath. However, the most relentless backlash has been coming from the men's rights activists (MRA). Active since the early 2000s, the MRAs are now angrier than ever. Their reason: laws that apparently protect women are built to harm men. We get inside the world of these "meninists"â€”who have now found support from a regulatory body of lawyers in New Delhiâ€”and find out why #MeToo has triggered a whole new #MenToo activism.

From last week's protest against the recent attacks on Roe v. Wade. The birth of #MeToo, historic battles for abortion rights in countries like Ireland, Poland and Argentina and the resurgence of the labor movement with women at the helm show that now is the time for a mass movement against sexist oppression and anti-choice attacks. We can't wait for establishment Democrats and liberal organizations like Planned Parenthood to unapologetically defend Roe. We need a movement for abortion rights that links itself with the fight for universal healthcare, a living wage, affordable housing and an end to capitalism and all the oppression it brings for women and all working people.

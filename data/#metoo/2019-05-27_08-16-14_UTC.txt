How is this something we even have to discuss?!. It’s the hardest decision I ever had to make! I’m not embarrassed by my decision as the life I could of given a child would never of been what they deserved! I cannot imagine those woman who have to fear this or struggle to survive due to not having a choice #ourbodies #metoo #abortionrights

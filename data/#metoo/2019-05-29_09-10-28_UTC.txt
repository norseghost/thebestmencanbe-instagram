My 2nd demonstration attending in Prague.  No matter where you are in the world, fight for justice, fight for accountability. Something that I've learned from the #metoo movement is that if someone doesn't stand up and hold someone accountable for their actions, they are either ok with those actions, or they've committed them also and are afraid to accept their own responsibility.  So when you see someone who isn't outraged, ask yourself which group they belong to.

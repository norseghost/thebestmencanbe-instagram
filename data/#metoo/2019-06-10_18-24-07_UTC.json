This book sucked me in from the first page and called out to me to keep reading throughout the weekend. I'm usually a very slow reader, but when books captivate me like this one did, I fly through it, not getting enough of the voice, the world, the characters, the story. \u2063\n\u2063\nThis was all true and then some for MY DARK VANESSA. \u2063\n\u2063\nGoing back and forth between the year 2000 to 2017, the era of the #MeToo movement, this book deals with a lot of heavy topics surrounding sexual abuse. Seeing Vanessa go through what she did with her predator teacher, to her grappling with the realities of what it did to her in her adult life was both tragic, disturbing, and fascinating in a horrifying way. Kate Elizabeth Russell's writing is a package of dynamite as Stephen King says! I couldn't get enough of as she told Vanessa's story that holds so much complexity about consent, abuse, PTSD, and the psychology behind why victims may not or cannot always come forward. \u2063\n\u2063\nI loved everything about this book even though it is a very dark read and doesn't shy away from the realities of sexual abuse. Please be advised of this when going in. If you're able to read it when it releases in January 2020, be prepared for a book that you won't be able to stop talking or thinking about. I can completely see why HarperCollins/William Morrow Books called this book an explosive, timely debut. An easy \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 from me!\u2063\n\u2063\n.\u2063\n.\u2063\n.\u2063\n\u2063\n#booksofinstagram #bookstagram #mydarkvanessa #arc #williammorrowbooks #harpercollins #bookaesthetic #prettybooks #booksandplants #bibliophile #instabooks #bookcon19 #bookcon"

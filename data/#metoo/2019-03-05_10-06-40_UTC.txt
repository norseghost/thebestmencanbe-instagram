WORK SEXUAL HARASSMENT MYTHS

According to theÂ Australian Human Rights Commission, in 2018, 23% of women & 16% of men have experienced sexual harassment at work in Australia.  Here are 8 common myths often used to justify sexually harassing behaviour:

1: People who get offended just canâ€™t take a joke or are too sensitive. 
2. Itâ€™s just boys being boy.
3: You should take it as a compliment. (If unwelcome, itâ€™s not a compliment).
4: Theyâ€™re one of our top performers... 5: Itâ€™s all gone too far â€“ we canâ€™t say or do anything these days!Â 
6: I donâ€™t want to get involved â€“ itâ€™s none of my business.
7: It only happens to [straight-cis] women.Â 
8: Itâ€™s mainly just senior men taking advantage of their secretaries. 
Sexual harassment in the workplace is about power.  It is disrespectful, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, cultural background, age etc.

On a personal note, I recall an incident of harassment when I was a young manager of about 28y old.  One of my older male colleagues ( who reported to me) grabbed me and popped me on his knee.  He then jiggled me up and down like a child, squuezing me & laughing at "how scrumptious" I looked ðŸ˜¤. Needless to say, I was outraged and set very firm boundaries.  He never touched me again, but it has stuck in my mind as a huge act of disrespect and attempted disempowerment.

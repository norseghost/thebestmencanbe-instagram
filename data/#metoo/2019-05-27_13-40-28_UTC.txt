Clothes don’t cause rape. Rapists cause rape.
This look today is inspired by the What Were You Wearing? exhibitions by artists around the world. Victim-blaming is a serious issue when it comes to sexual assault, you may have heard people saying things like “she/he was asking for it wearing clothes like that” or “he/she should have covered themself up more” and therefore claiming that these things have happened because of what the victim is wearing. Of course, this is not the case. Every single outfit shown my face today is a real life story from some incredibly brave (anonymous) survivors who have told their story. Sexual assault can (very sadly) happen to anyone, no matter their age, gender or what they are wearing. So stop trying to claim that people need to cover up more, or not go out at night, or be more alert. Stop blaming the victims and start blaming the rapists.

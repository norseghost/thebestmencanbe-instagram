                        "text": "DESCRIPTION OF FALLACY: When you appeal to something that is irrelevant, fabricated, or unsubstantiated in regards to the argument you are trying to make. Another way to think of it is when you assert a cause-effect relationship that probably does not exist, or at least you don\u2019t provide evidence to show that it does.\n.\nSo to demonstrate this fallacy through the spanking example (taken from Kimmel, 2018) \u2014 the person is at least implying that spanking is acceptable because they are okay; or at most they are asserting that spanking is what \u201ccaused\u201d them to turn out okay when perhaps they turned out okay in spite of their being spanked. (This last statement by far has the most empirical support e.g. Gershoff, 2013).\n.\nEXAMPLES OF THIS FALLACY IN GENDER-RELATED CONVERSATIONS:\n.\n1. \u201cI was hazed when I first joined this team and it\u2019s harmless or \u201ccharacter building\u201d so I\u2019m going to haze you.\u201d - In this type of argument they provide no support that it\u2019s harmless, and they also use \u201ccharacter building\u201d as a justification for its continuation.\n. \nHere\u2019s the thing, it very well might have been a character building experience for you because you developed resiliency skills in the process, but that doesn\u2019t mean that because you overcame something other people need to go through the same experience. (IMO there are other ways to build character without humiliation as a necessary component).\n.\n2. \u201cI know ______ to be a great guy\u201d \u2014 I\u2019ve seen this used in #metoo conversations to defend a male\u2019s character. First of all, they rarely give reasons to support what they mean by their \u201cgreat guy\u201d claim, and secondly, it doesn\u2019t logically follow that just because someone is a \u201cgreat guy\u201d doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t capable of terrible things.\n.\nWHY WOULD SOMEONE USE THIS ARGUMENT?: Any time they want to bolster a claim without having to do the work to properly justify it, or without having to critique/change their previously held belief\u2014thus maintaining the status quo.\n.\n.\n.\n#remasculate #logicalfallacy #masculinitysofragile #masculinity #niceguy #malefeminist #corporalpunishment #hazing #humiliation #hazingpreventionweek #feminism #lgbt #toxicmasculinity #positivemasculinity"

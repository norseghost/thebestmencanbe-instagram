If you truly want to impact the world and change lives there is no escaping collaboration. Too many times competition and fear of the losing can cause people to forsake meaningful collaborative efforts that can truly impact those they serve and increase their GPM. Only the Father knows what will come of this relationship with my pharmasister, Dr. Kat Fischer, but FicusRx is excited about the potential opportunity to connect and collaborate on any level. Check out @springbranchrx. Her patients are having great results with their CBD OIL! #ironshapensiron #collaborationovercompetition #MeToo #LadyBosses #UIWalumni #knowyourpharmacist

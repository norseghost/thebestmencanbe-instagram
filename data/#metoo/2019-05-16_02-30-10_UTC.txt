I think this is something a lot of people don’t understand. For the past month every once in a while when I was texting the guy I like I would say “hope I’m not bothering you” and last night we got into a fight over it and I feel like he doesn’t understand that even though the first time he told me I’m not bothering him, because of my anxiety I get scared people are annoyed with me or will leave me or secretly hate me so when I say that multiple times im not trying to be annoying im just scared

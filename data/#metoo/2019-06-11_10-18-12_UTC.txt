The feminine subject will always be relevant in my art and writing. Iâ€™ll be focusing even more on symbolism, metaphors and references. .

Iâ€™ve been offline for the most part while Iâ€™ve been traveling these last few months as bringing oils and canvases wasnâ€™t feasible. So, I invested in a different medium - itâ€™s always difficult to transition to something new when youâ€™ve become inclined to something else. Given enough patience, itâ€™s always good to try something new. My pen and ink has always remained popular - playing with this has combined my love for oil with the discipline of ink. #win .

“Never mix up the Apartheid State of Israel Representatives, with or without beard, with the true Judaism of love and compassion for peace and justice. The Israeli Apartheid is a criminal system of ethnic cleansers of darkness and against the lives of Palestinians. The peaceful Judaism on the other hand is the light and love of life, love for the lives of everyone and the lives of Palestinians too.”R.F.

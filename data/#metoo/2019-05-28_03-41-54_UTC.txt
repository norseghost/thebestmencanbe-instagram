The #MeToo movement was founded by Tarana Burke in 2006. Her mission was to help black women and girls in lower-class communities who survived sexual violence. Her #MeToo campaign gained international attention on every social media platform. The #MeToo movement offers a number of resources to survivors, collects research, as well as other things. The #MeToo movement also addresses a womanâ€™s right to have control over her body and the what happens to it.

“Eid is a time to be with family for me, and truly be aware of our privilege. It’s a moment where I can just be grateful but also realize that not everyone has the security that we do in the month of Ramadan. Other people don’t have plates of food available for them at the end of the day. And I’m glad I get that humbling reminder every year and go through it with my family.” #ourwomensvoices #eidmubarak

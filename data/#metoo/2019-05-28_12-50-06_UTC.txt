Tomorrow we are going to the beach for a couple days! Because my skin is basically translucent, sunburn is inevitable. So I made after sun gel which feels amazing after a long day in the sun
.
All you need is Aloe Vera Gel, peppermint, and lavender essential oil.
.
Mix it all up and put it in a mason jar! That's it!
.
To get an extra cooling effect, keep it in the fridge!

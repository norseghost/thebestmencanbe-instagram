I usually donâ€™t do this but I have to speak on this because Iâ€™m am so sadden, disgusted, outraged and mad as hell of how the justice system failed those young boys and failed that women who was brutally raped and left for dead. You Linda Fairstein are an evil and a despicable and there is a special place in hell for you. You ruined LIVES, you broke up FAMILIES, and you had the real man who did the crime kill another women. You manipulated these boys into making it seem that if they admitted to something they did not do that they would be released home. You broke the law by having these boys be beaten, terrorized and and interrogated by the police without a LAWYER or any PARENT IN THE ROOM. Then on top of that when their was EVIDENCE CLEARLY SHOWING THAT THEY DIDNT DO IT. You didnâ€™t care you just wanted to throw them in jail. You made it seem like you cared about the women who was raped. But you didnâ€™t care. You donâ€™t care at all because if you cared about what happened you wouldnâ€™t help Harvey Weinstein get acquitted of charges back in 2015. But enough of this bitch. Iâ€™m so sorry to what happend to these men. It is not ok in any way how part of your life was stolen from you. How yâ€™all went threw hell and then once you got released shit was harder for you all. And Korey Wise you are a warrior you went thru the most hell and seeing your story broke my heart. Seeing how you were treated in prison make me hurt. I swear to god this system is broken. This country is fucked up. And what makes me more mad that the person who was behind yâ€™all being in jail is now the fucking president. Thank you @ava for sharing there story. Please bring more awareness to cases like this. Iâ€™m so depressed right now I could barely get any sleep but I needed to say this ðŸ˜ž #whentheyseeus #centralparkfive #justice #koreywise #blacklivesmatter #Metoo

Meet the Playground Artists 
Joanna Cleary ( all of the things weâ€™re taking)
Joanna Cleary is an honours English Literature and Theatre and Performance undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo. As a playwright, her work has previously appeared in UWaterloo's UpStart 2018 Festival of Student Work and Flush Ink Productions' 2018 She Speaks - #MeToo staged readings. Playground 2019 is her directorial debut. Inspired by Lorde's "Perfect Places," Joanna wrote all of the things we're taking because she believes there should be more theatre that focuses on what it means to be young and ashamed. Coming up, she will be working as the assistant director under the supervision of Green Light Arts' artistic director, Matt White, in UWaterloo's Fall 2019 production of Chekhov's The Seagull.Joanna Cleary is an honours English Literature and Theatre and Performance undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo.

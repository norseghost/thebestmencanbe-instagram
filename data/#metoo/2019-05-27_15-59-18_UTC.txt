Part two!

She is asked the question again, but with the additional detail of if she threw the can that hit him in the head "in front of two different employees". She responds "Oh. That's true. I just explained it, I guess." Keeping in mind that in the explanation she did admit.
After some dispute between counsels, Amber's counsel (Mr. Harder) tries to get her to explain it again (possibly hoping for a different outcome?), but Ms. Berk stated she isn't asking for anything other than a "yes or no".
She's eventually asked the question again, asking the date as Dec.15 instead of the 30th this time. There are a ton of dates to keep up with here as Johnny has testified to Amber assaulting him on December 15, 2015 as well, with these submitted photos. (Pic 3, 4 & 5) finally, for what seems like the first time in this whole series of threads, Amber answers a question directly with "No." After further discussion and dispute between each counsel, they move on.
Even though, in Amber's most recent court sworn declaration, she repeats the perjurious testimony that she only ever hit Johnny Depp once in their entire relationship, that simply is not true.
In the threads we've examined of her sworn deposition, Amber Heard ADMITS UNDER OATH to numerous accounts of physical violence against Johnny Depp. Including kicking a door into his head, purposely punching him in the face & throwing multiple objects at him.

Same woman, I think. Both found at a thrift store yesterday. Trying to figure out if I like the black and white or color better. 1960s is more in line with the other work but I respond better to the late 70s/early 80s images in color. It’ll take a while to work this out and finalize but I’m having fun playing with the possibilities.

It's Memorial Day, the official summer kickoff, and for many women, it is also the time of year we take the most crap from men. Listen. It's gonna be hot, and people, including women, tend to wear less clothing. I know society has taught you that when you see skin, it's appropriate for you to react like a primate, but it's not. Short shorts, swimwear, low-cut tops and the like will be in full effect. You can look. You may even comment (but don't get outta hand), but the absolute line is grabbing, groping or in any other way touching a woman's body without her consent. If she hugs you, that doesn't mean you get to do anything else. Full disclosure- this just happened to me a few days ago, and I was kinda caught off guard bc of where I was and who it was, but I'm on alert, and I'm now ready to correct a mf at any given moment. And if you are a man, and you see that shit happen, I need you to let your boys know that shit is not okay. Sadly, men don't care about women's personal space unless they "belong" to another guy, so we need your help to let them know that coupled or not, a woman's body is HERS, not anyone else's, even if she is butt ass naked. .

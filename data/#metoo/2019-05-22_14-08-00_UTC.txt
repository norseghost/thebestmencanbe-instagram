After watching the news this morning regarding #metoo and McDonalds, none of these women went to work to be made to feel uncomfortable- I applaud them for not keeping quiet and isn’t it a shame -  and shame on this country for allowing harassment in any form for so long in the work place.  BUT it is not just in the work place that it is happening and we all need to take a stand to stop it from happening!!! With that being said-  I went on a cruise in April on Norwegian Epic to celebrate a very good friends birthday.  Overall had a fantastic time. The one thing that happened to diminish the experience was when one of the employees put his hands on my hips while my friends and I were dancing, when I turned in surprise he grabbed his back as if “his attempt to lift me hurt him” I am a big girl no question-  BUT I did not ask for him to place his hands on me and make me feel embarrassed!  I will not be quiet about this!!! This is his picture (I just happened to catch it in a video I took of my friend). YES I have been in contact with #NCL several times, I have filed a formal complaint, I have been on Twitter multiple times.  Yesterday I was on hold with NCL for over an hour and when the phone was finally answered I was told that my complaint would not even be looked at for at least 3 more weeks!!! NOT ACCEPTABLE.  I am almost 54 years old,  I am not a naive 20 something.  I am outspoken most of the time-  I will not be quiet now!!! Ladies of all ages-  You need to use your outside voices!!!! Do not accept anything less than complete respect-  in the work place or in public!!!!

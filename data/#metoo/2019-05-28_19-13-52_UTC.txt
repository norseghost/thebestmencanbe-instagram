In a captivating 18-chapter saga, Andrea courageously shares the horrors of the incestual child abuse she experienced from ages six to 14, and the triumph of justice she pursued in her later teens. While what happened to Andrea is sickening and depraved, her Truth is a powerful and critical read for anyone who is open to gaining greater, detailed understanding of the behaviors and coping mechanisms that manifest when a child or teenager is experiencing abuse. Likewise, in a world where legal victory for survivors is rare, Andrea’s Truth is a testament to the promise that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” Andrea, thank you for your courage then and your courage now—we believe (in) you.

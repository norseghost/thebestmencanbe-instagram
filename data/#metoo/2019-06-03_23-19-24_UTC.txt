Day 1: @jessiereyez @govballnyc @randallsisland üî•

Jessie killed it. There is no discussion. She goes off hard, she works hard and she deserves all the recognition. If you are a female artist who wants to be where she is at and does not know her story (look it up, her story is on youtube and she explains how messed up the industry can be...especially how disgusting men can be) and she will inspire you. DO NOT LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE NOT WORTH IT. ESPECIALLY, DO NOT LET A MAN TELL YOU THAT YOU AREN‚ÄôT WORTH ANYTHING UNTIL YOU F**K THEM BECAUSE YOUR DREAMS ARE IN THEIR HANDS. Jessie is on the rise and rose like a phoenix. She made her dreams happen, took that man‚Äôs words and destroyed them by staying true to her values and being herself. I hope he‚Äôs choking on his words now. I love everything that this girl represents for all females in the music industry. BECAUSE WE ARE THE ‚ÄúGATEKEEPER‚Äù! Her writing is from her heart and her voice can carry any room. She‚Äôs on a whole other level. Don‚Äôt sleep on Jessie and listen to her music. DAMN. WHAT A SHOW. THANK YOU ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•

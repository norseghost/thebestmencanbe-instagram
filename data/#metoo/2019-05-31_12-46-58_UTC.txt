As you know, I've finished my short story collection and just waiting for feedback from the three remaining readers who have the manuscript. So far, the feedback has been incredible.

In the last couple of weeks, I have started writing "Bubble & Squeak" (working title), the novel that I have been planning since last Summer. .
.
The main female character is a young, very successful pop star. So that I can make the story believable, I want to make sure that I get the detail right and have been trying to reach out to musicians on social media for interviews. Of course, it's not as easy as that... they donâ€™t usually reply.

So, I'm reaching out here. I hope to find a pool of people that I can ask questions to about being a musician (especially a young, successful, female musician) today, about touring (day to day schedules, backstage, riders, aftershows, parties etc.), management, labels, photoshoots, recording and recording studios, instruments and equipment, mental health, #metoo and #timesup.

I don't know the best way to do this? Maybe creating a closed Facebook group? If you think you may be able to help or know people who might, please put them in touch.

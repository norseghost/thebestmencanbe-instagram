Credit to @theebutterflyproject : Domestic violence is nothing to be passive about. It is time for you to speak up and out about what you see. There are ways to report abuse anonymously if you fear retaliation. No one should live in fear on your watch. Never intervene, your safety is important. But do say something if even if it's after some time befriend and be an ear. Don't allow domestic violence to become normalized around us.

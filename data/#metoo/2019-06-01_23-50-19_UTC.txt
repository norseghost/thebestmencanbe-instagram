Thank you #ellendegeneres for your profound bravery on #mynextguestneedsnointroductionwithdavidletterman 
Thank you to the young 'you' who came forward, frightened and unsure, and sat in your chair. With great courage, she told her truth so that others could speak. Her sadness and fear was raw and real, transporting us far from the star, back to a 15 year old girl running from an evil man and a weakened mother. As mothers we cannot be silent, deny and turn away to save ourselves from discomfort or for dysfunctional love. As girls and women we must be inspired by those before us, find our voice and tell the true story of hurt. David sat with authentic compassion and held the space with love. Two people creating a very powerful human moment. Brave. Vulnerable. Powerful.

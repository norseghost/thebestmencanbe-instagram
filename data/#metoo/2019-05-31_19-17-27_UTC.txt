Always wonderful to have the support of my lovely friend @juliet_landau - sheâ€™s not only helping me promote my show, but sheâ€™s also been an insightful outside eye for me (always essential when youâ€™re self-directing). Book now for our Pay What You Can preview on June 8th. If you can afford a cup of coffee, you can afford our play - & itâ€™ll last longer & be more satisfying!

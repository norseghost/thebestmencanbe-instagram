Women are tougher than men.
Fact. Don’t take it from me — this is not an op-ed. It’s official: science has spoken.
Women are more likely to survive famine and epidemics, according to a study from Duke University in North Carolina that describes women as “life expectancy champions.”The study concludes that, “even when mortality was very high, women lived longer on average than men.”
It draws its conclusions from hospital records from the last 250 years, including during severe humanitarian crises. The investigation included seven specific groups of people experiencing hardship, famine, and disease, and who had a resulting life expectancy of less than 20 — but almost always there was one sex that seemed better suited to survive.
Slave plantations in Trinidad and the US in the early 1800s? Women.
Famines in Sweden, Ireland, and the Ukraine in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries? Women, women, women.
Measles outbreaks in Iceland between 1846 and 1882? Men. No, wait, just kidding — it was definitely women.
It’s already well known that women live longer than men. Indeed, when you contemplate the list updated by the Gerontology Research Group that tracks all living supercentenarians — the awesome superhero name given to humans over the age of 110 — only one out of every 40 are male.
Across the planet the average life expectancy for women is 72 years and eight months, and just 68 years and four months for men. In the UK the gap is marginally smaller: women live on average to 82.9, and men to 79.2. But for the first time in a decade, the gap is no longer closing. 
And in non-scientific terms? It seems you don’t need a latex suit and a film franchise to be superhuman anymore — you just need to be female.

We are proud to be invited to the Women's International Film & Arts festival, New York, NY June 6-9 2019. ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
Once There Was A Winter is a timely and relevant story that is a must see in this current political and social climate of #metoo , and a part of the tidal wave of intersectional feminism CRITICAL for active change.⠀⠀

Please see the film and DM me if you would like to talk about the film or just connect as I am unable to attend. Gratitude and thanks.⠀⠀

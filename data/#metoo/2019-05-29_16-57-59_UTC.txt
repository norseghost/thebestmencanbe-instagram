This account is for you. You, the young people, anyone as angry as I am. The ones who need change. Regardless of your gender, race, sexuality, class... We all want change, and that’s what unites us. Let’s be powerful.

I hope to publish a manifesto for young people, especially in light of the many political storms we are facing at the present moment. Follow to stay updated on publication (it will be cheap and accessible!) later this year. ☀️

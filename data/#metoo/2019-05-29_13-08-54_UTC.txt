Fear.
Everybody has them, it could be heights, spiders, death, dirt etc. But when fear takes the best of you and you had some kind of trauma and PTSD. It's a total different feeling of fear. My biggest fear right now is to see my rapist at court and I'm scared it will happen again with somebody else. What is your biggest fear related with your trauma? ðŸ—£

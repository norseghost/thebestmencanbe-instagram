🌈 HAPPY #PRIDE 🌈 From the age of 9, I have been raised by a single-mom and two gay men who have become our chosen family. My first introduction to activism in any form was when I was in middle school and canvassed for same-sex marriage in Portland,OR.

This year is the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots — a series of demonstrations by members of the LGBTQ+ community against POLICE RAIDS that took place at the Stonewall Inn in NYC in 1969. These riots were some of the most important events catalyzing the gay liberation movement.

As we celebrate this month, remember the history of PRIDE and the fearlessness and resilience of activists like Marsha P.

We still have so much work to be done in fighting for LGBTQIA+ rights and recognition — and while we continue to work, this #pridemonth we celebrate (even more than we should all year) how far we have come.
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜

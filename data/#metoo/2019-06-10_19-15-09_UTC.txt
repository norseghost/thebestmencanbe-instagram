I learned to forgive, then I learned there was nothing to forgive, then I learned to be grateful for it all. I learned that my suffering was being to occupied with the self in this physical plane, I learned that my spirit never got or could ever be touched or abused, that was only a mentality taught by society. Today I have helped 1000’s understand that what we get to do in our lifetime is get to know thyself, the beauty of the truth we always have been and always will be. The second thing I learned is I get to play BIG in life and not make my past or childhood my problem or existence, my play BIG is to raise the vibration of earth, to raise the Schuman Resonance aka Earths heartbeat to 15.0hz vs current 7.83. Not to be insensitive to any other survivor we are all on our journey yet like to share what is possible. If you can say, hmm, interesting the answers can come. From my heart to yours Make it an awesome Monday 💪🏼💯💜😘 #playbig #noteventheking #iamathriver #seekyourhigherpower #playbigrituals #mindrituals #soulrituals #metoo #fulfillmenttolifeisgetbetterproblems #loveyourz

In the 1980s, there was an increase in movies that used their platform to spark conversation about sexual assault (ParentMap). These movies include “Almost Famous,” “Back to the Future,” “Ghostbusters,” “Revenge of the Nerds,” and “Sixteen Candles.” Recently, Molly Ringwald did an interview on NPR reflecting on Sixteen Candles, an iconic movie that she starred in as a teen. Ringwald said that the intention of the films was to represent what was happening during the time, and that they were an accurate reflection of the culture at the time, teen sexual assault being a big issue. Now that she has a teenage daughter, Ringwald believes that these movies should be used to spark conversation among teens in a comfortable way so that the rape culture can be dealt with (Navarro). Also in the eighties, federal dollars started being allocated for sexual violence prevention, so the government started to get more involved in the issues (WCASP). The eighties was one of the most difficult times to report rape and date rape and kidnapping rape became very common (Daily Kos). #metoo #metoomovement #1980s #rapeculture #sixteencandles #mollyringwald #npr

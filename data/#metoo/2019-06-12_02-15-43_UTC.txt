She’s watching me.
.
She’s learning from me.
.
She sees how i react to the things around me. She sees my habits, my emotions and my self care practices.
.
She is why I am so mindful of the way I treat and speak about women’s bodies now.
.
Yes, I am mindful with my boys as well, especially when it comes to male body image. .
BUT
.
They will not have the same struggles as my daughter will.
.
They will not see pants marked with the same size and yet be completely different sizes.
.
They will not be ridiculed, harassed or seen as objects.
. 
Unless, unless WE change things.
.
I want my daughter to grow up knowing she is an incredible person who brings more to this world than her sexuality or looks.
.
We are getting close, but we aren’t there yet. I don’t want my daughter to have a #metoo story just like I do, like her grandmother does and her great grandmother. .
So I practice self love, self care, healthy habits and positive speech. Not only about those around me but about myself as well.
.
She’s watching me and I want to prepare her the best way that I can. .
By being unapologetically me.

An anthropologist played a game with the children of an African tribe. He put a basket full of fruit near a tree, and told the children that the first-come would win the fruits🥇🏆.
Then he told them to run🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️, but the children took each other's hands and ran together👬👭. When they reached the basket, they sat in a circle and divided the fruits.
So the anthropologist asked the children why they did not do the race, and they replied: "Ubuntu, how can you be happy if everyone else is sad?".
"Ubuntu" is a philosophy of sub-Saharan Africa, which can be translated as "I am what I am thanks to what we are all" - In this case their Ubuntu philosophy dismisses the anthropologists divide and rule game! More power to those children and their Tradition.

Reposted from @rt - "Sexism or rules of dress code?

Japanese actor Yumi Ishikawa launched a hashtag #KuToo this spring to fight against mandatory high heels in numerous Japanese companies. The hashtag, which is a wordplay of combining two words - shoe and pain - has become so popular that this week Ishikawa submitted an official petition to the Labour ministry.

Nevertheless, the Health and Labour minister Takumi Nemoto was clear – 'It is socially accepted as something that falls within the realm of being occupationally necessary and appropriate.'" #KuToo #WomensRights #MeToo #EqualRights #Japan #YumiIshikawa⁣ #HumanRights #genderinequality #sexualviolence #sexualdiscrimination #sexualcommodification #antihighheels #sexism #genderinequality #genderdiscrimination #workplacediscrimination #everydaysexism

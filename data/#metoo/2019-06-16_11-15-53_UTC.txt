@future playing, face mask going, me shaking my organ(ic) body. Like many of us I’ve thought about making adjustments to my body, but for now I’ve decided to get a little more comfortable in this body right here, the way it is, minus some of the bloating, but you get what I’m saying. I kind of wanna love this version of me a little harder before making any adjustments, after all this self love thing is still new territory and I don’t wanna disrupt it by addressing my physical self before ensuring my inner self is solid. Leave a heart if you made it to the end of this and understand pretty please 🙏🏽 Inspired by: @ladysavaj and @evyan.whitney 
Song: please tell me 
Side note: the lady in me loves Ciara but the fuck boy in me loves future what can I say duality. Ladies can be fuckboys too 🤣

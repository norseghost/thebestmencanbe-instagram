“what does a chronically ill person look like? 
Most of the time our illness is invisible to the naked eye, give or take some symptoms we display during “flare-up” moments. we look like you and me. we don’t have some unicorn horn or badge on our shirt to point us out to the general population. we’re everywhere around you and you may have no idea at all. we’re secret superheroes, undercover detectives, messengers from god sent here to give the able-bodied individuals faith and encouragement that real strength has nothing to do with physical stature at all. 
strength is waking up everyday and fighting your own internal body parts before you even set foot outside to deal with the chaos of society. we have learned to work, build businesses, raise children, maintain relationships, hold space for others, exhaust ourselves simultaneously while constantly battling the only body we live inside. and oddly enough, we learn to lovingly surrender to the body, for the sake of having life. as a result, we strengthen our minds and spirit in an otherworldly fashion that nobody sees, but everybody feels.”

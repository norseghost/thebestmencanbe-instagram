Happy Caturday. I’m traveling to Carolina to sell my furniture and it’s a bit triggering for my PTSD. I had someone call me ‘Ms.America’ and say everything I’m doing is for attention or for ‘clout’. Everything I post is here is documenting my recovery through my PTSD, anxiety and depression. As a sexual assault and domestic abuse survivor, please do not judge me without knowing my struggles. #survivorstory #ptsdawareness #mentalhealthawareness #ptsd #positivevibes #ptsd #ptsdrecovery #recovery #metoo #womenempowerment #believesurvivors #domesticviolence

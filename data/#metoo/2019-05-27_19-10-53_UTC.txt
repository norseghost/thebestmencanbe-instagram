lets be real,,,,these laws aren't trying to save lives. Its never been about saving lives. If pro lifers really cared about other people like they claim they do then they would be helping out and trying to do something about all the lives in foster homes, and homeless people and those who don't have access to education. But all these laws are actually trying to do is control people's bodies. -ðŸŒ¹

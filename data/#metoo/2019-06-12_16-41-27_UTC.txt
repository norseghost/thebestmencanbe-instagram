My journey to present day 💕in my highlights for anyone that would like to listen,from 1 to 3 😊xx I don’t think we are every finished learning new things about ourselves but one thing that I have taken from the last 2 years is,that you have to strip things back and be vulnerable and find the courage to Rise again 💕and I’m definitely doing that xx Selfcare is the upmost important thing that you can do for yourself...put yourself first and then everything else falls into place ❤️and I’ve said since day one here on Instagram,if it helps 1 person sharing my story then it’s all worthwhile x #selfcare #mytruth #mystory #myrise #metoo

We support @ncardenastx in her fight against Alejandro Caceres, an abuser she hadn't seen in years. Please donate to help with the fees she is accruing defending herself in court. Venmo: ncardenastx

Alejandro is currently suing Nancy for speaking up about his abusive behaviors and even goes so far as to out the fact that she had an abortion, for someone who pretends to be a leftist, we find it incredibly deceitful that he would utilize the oppressive legal system to punish Nancy. ..
..
Alejandro Caceres should not be allowed to occupy a single inch in movement spaces while he continues to cause harm and weaponize liberalism and identity politics to deflect the righteous anger of women. Women should be aware of his manipulative ploys and refrain from associating with him. All organizations that work with Alejandro should cut ties with him until he publically admits his abuse and actively works to redeem himself..

WE STAND WITH NANCY!
We must organize working class women against abusers!

(Image description: a tweet from Dr. Connie Wun that reads last night at AAPi Women Lead launched our movement building series in San Jose. We talked about intersectionality, Asian + Pacific Islander womxn + girls, colonization, #metoo and more and solidarity work. Someone said it gave them two decades of life. In it for the long haul).

Wow, I met Eve Ensler @eveensler! She was interviewed by @idinamenzel (Actress: Frozen) as a part of @livetalksla. Eve is the Author of The Vagina Monologues - “Probably the most important piece of political theater of the last decade.” — New York Times.  Eve is also the founder of One Billion Rising (global campaign to end the rape and sexual violence against women). Her life experiences as a child led Eve to write her latest book, The Apology @theapology. “Unflinching candor...immeasurable grace...she takes us on her own journey to healing.” Anita Hill describing Eve’s latest book. 
Thank you @kristinaforca and @lindseyphorvath for the invite

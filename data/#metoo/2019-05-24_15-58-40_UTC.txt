Alanis Morissette (@alanis):
The degree and intensity of my [postpartum] depression shocked me. I am predisposed to depression, but what surprised me this time was the physical pain. I hadnâ€™t realized the depths to which you can ache: limbs, back, torso, head, everything hurt â€” and it went on for 15 months. I felt as if I was covered in tar and everything took 50 times more effort than normal. I wished I could have cried but there was no relief during that time; my version of depression is almost below crying, where there is just despondency. Amazingly, it didnâ€™t hinder the creative process and I wrote the album [Havoc and Bright Lights]. I had various therapies and now I feel all light and springy. Thankfully, it didnâ€™t interfere with the bond with my son, although I think that has strengthened since I got better in April. â€” TheDaily Mail, August 2012

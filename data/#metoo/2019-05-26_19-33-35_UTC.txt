Just a little something I wrote on how we feel on "some" days *some * times ;) Half asleep I lay in my bed,
Contemplating about how the world thinks of me,
Wondering about people's opinion of me
Who might not even matter 5 years down the lane.
Scrutinizing
If I'm not good enough.
Shattered by people's rejection I stay forlorn,
Dressing up to impress people
Only to hear I'm the one asking for it,
Confined by society's image I stand my ground.
Asking myself if I'm truly not good enough.
Fearful and nervous for my future I lay,
Contemplating if I can secure that package that they want me to?
Asking myself if I can finally be the worthy child,
Or if I'm just meant to be wild.
Work diligently, I do 
On something I don't aspire to achieve,
Just because "they" want me to.
And if I'm worth chasing the dreams,
To make me have a life, the way they want me to.
Making me afraid,
To ask myself if I'm not good enough.
Confine myself to "that person" 
Who stayed with me,
Although their presence hasn't always been a pleasure
Insecure that their absence might make me undesirable,
Thus making me ask myself once again
If I'm not good enough
Look in the mirror I do sometimes,
To realize how I don't have the perfect figure
For how they want me to look like,
Wondering what I should do? 
Not give into the lifestyle I love,
Or to live on the foods I totally hate,
Or maybe,just maybe for me it's too late!?
And then I ask myself again'
If I'm not good enough.
Confined by people's opinion of me
And their predictability about my future,
I regretfully give in to the desires that make me feel good temporarily,
Just so I can play safe all my life,
Succumb to my true desires,dreams and aspirations
So that I don't have to hear the rejections 
Which will eventually make me ask myself
If "I'm really not good enough?" ~Jasmann Singh (@jasmann_03)

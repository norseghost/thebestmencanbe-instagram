So I’m up just looking at # after checking the #lottery mega millions to see if I won the $530 million jackpot tonight. 💰 💰 💰 I did not 🥺 now the first tag I look up is #nightowl scroll through the feed like some pictures then the next tag I look for is #insomnia and that is when I get this prompt from ig. . . 
I feel they knew I was upset about not winning that $530 million tonight 😆

But all joking aside I didn’t even know that this was something that Instagram monitored let alone offered support 💗 I really think this is amazing and could save a life❣️ #suicideprevention #imhereforyou #savesomeone #savesomeoneslife #save #saysomethingsavesomeone #someonecomesaveme #someonesaveme #live #18002738255 #1800273talk #yourenotalone #youmattertome #youmattertoo #yourstorymatters #mentalhealthawareness #itsoknottobeok #survive #domesticviolence #domesticviolencesurvivor #survivors #metoo #metoomovement #stillfighting #laughteristhebestmedicine #staystrong

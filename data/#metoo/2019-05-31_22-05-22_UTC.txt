Mormonism in Utah....Women are forced to engage in incestuous relationships with the men in their family,forced to marry their cousins and produce children for as long as their body is able to. They live in constant fear of the men in their families if they donâ€™t follow rules.....This begs the question: how many more religious sects in America are forcing women and girls ( and boys) to do this???ðŸ’”ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜” #politics #feminist #feminism #london #blogger #smashpatriarchy #justice #metoo #timesup

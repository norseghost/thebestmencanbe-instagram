For #pridemonth 🏳️‍🌈 we’re featuring Queer Women in our community and their story. Meet Tiana (@teetrx) a multidisciplinary artist who uses her platform to represent Black & Queer people! .
.
“I feel that being both black and queer makes me feel powerful, yet overlooked. The intersecting identities remind me that being me is all I need to be. While discovering all of who I am I have sometimes felt estranged from both communities for not being black enough or queer enough..." We all share similar struggles. Being able to create a safe space is important to developing a voice and empowering other who share the same experiences.
Despite, the struggles of intersectionality and building confidence, “I think when you come to a point when you are honest with yourself about who are, you slowly learn to understand why it’s important to love all of who you are. It’s a long and difficult process that takes time. I’ve learned that a lot of people will try to tell you who you are when you don’t know yourself. It’s important to have pride in who you are because it celebrates how far you’ve come.” — @teetrx! 
You can meet Tee on On June 20th to 22nd at her “Come As You Are” gallery event where she shares her pride in an intimate celebration of art and love. Support her as she encourages you to be your most authentic self, and solidifies the message that you are loved, and seen. #ourwomensvoices 📸 by @photosbyzain

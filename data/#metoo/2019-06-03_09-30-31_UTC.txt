A single flower no matter the type always has me reflecting. .
The poppy for our fallen heroes and the blood that shed. And those that still protect us 🙏🏼
.
Any others remind me to keep fighting to live my own life. Even if it goes against all others. .
Shine bright on your own if needs be. .  I’ve lost people I know to Suicide. 
Youngest being a young 28yr old friend who you would have thought had everything to live for. A family farm was his future, a rocky on/off relationship. Rugged model looks that had women all over him. 
Hidden away sadly he had his own silent battles. And A pissed up night to cheer him sadly gave him the courage to end it all. On the end of his belt, at home, once alone again. 🙏🏼😢 will never forget you Rob. 💜 
And I’ve also felt and listened to families who have lost loved ones after a long fight to it, through my privileged place in the funeral industry for 2 years. .

To conclude. I Also in life before now, I have felt those strong feelings myself. Learning to shoot in itself gave me back so much more to smile about  #keepingitreal. 💜

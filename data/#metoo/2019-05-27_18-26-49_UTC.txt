Reposted from @earthlove777 -  Rp @peacebyvegan I think I haven‚Äôt really been clear about this in my content so far. I talk a lot about the animals that we eat - but not as often about all other animals.
-
The extent to which animals are exploited is insane, and they don‚Äôt just include those that we eat.
-
Eating a cake with eggs seems a lot more innocent than eating a burger or a piece of bacon, but that only plays out in our perception and the stories we tell ourselves.
-
If you care about animals, oppose ALL forms of animal exploitation, not just the ones that are outwardly obvious ‚úåüèº

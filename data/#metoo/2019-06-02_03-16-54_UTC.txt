Have you ever looked at a storm and thought "wow, that is one beautiful storm"- even though (not pictured) it may be a storm that will certainly cause some damage? .
THIS is exactly how I can explain to you HOW to get through the hard shit in your life. Take a step outside yourself, and think wow- it's a beautiful storm I am going through. There is ART and BEAUTY and surely when it passes, the calm after the storm is incredible and we move on with our lives. .
Listen, I know. I KNOW that there are just some things that feel like your heart is being pulled right out of your chest. I've experienced loss, sexual assault, narcissism, molestation, manipulation. I live with grief EVERY. DAY. it's the FIRST thing I think EVERY MORNING. But just after that I make the choice to find the art and the beauty in the story that was given to me so that I can live in peace and choose happiness.
.
Storms ALWAYS pass. Storms can be of multiple severity. But the views, the sound of the rain, the SMELL of the earth, the cool humid air- it's something to take into awe- JUST like your story of strength and triumph. ðŸ’™

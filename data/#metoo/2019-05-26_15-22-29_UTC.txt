The basic definition of sexual assault is forcing another into a sexual act against their will. Anything verbal, visual, or physical that they don’t want to do in order to meet a predator’s sexual wants. 
Does not only happen between an adult and a child. Abuse can happen between an adult and an adult, an adult and a teen, an adult and a child, a teen with a teen, a teen with a child, or between two children. It can also happen in the context of incest, dating relationships, and marriage. Forms of contact sexual abuse are: touching or fondling without consent, excessive tickling and physical restraint, french kissing a teen or child, and intercourse, oral sex, or sodomy with a teen or child. #notjustahashtagpodcast

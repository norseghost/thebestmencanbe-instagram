Even though I can't take off the veil of repercussions from my head,\nthere is absolutely zilch that I regret. Your blood constantly oozing out of the stab holes makes me want to flush all of those years of trauma into the pool in which your body stays put now. I swear I haven't been this content before. You taught me dirty games while I grew up, long long before I could label the games as 'Clean' or 'Dirty' and so\nfor years, I couldn't undress the scarf of squick. Back then, I didn't try retaliating because I didn't know how to.\nTonight,\nYou did it again.\nAlmost in the same setup,\nthe same place,\nin the same parts of me.\nBut remember?\nI had warned you that I breathe fire now and that I will burn your body with my one exhale,\nwhich has this baggage of my dead yearning and joy constantly triggered by the speckles of brewing rebuke.\nYou should have listened to me when I squealed: 'NO'\nBut you kept arguing whilst your chin was drenched with lust disguised as saliva.\nI wasn't playing hard to get, someone should have already told you.\nLook,\nWhat you made me do. I killed my Father's eldest brother. Father didn't teach me this.\nBut he taught me to not be tolerant while someone consumed you. He taught me to seek vengeance in fair ways. Maybe my way was a little extraordinary, but tell me.\nWhat choice was I left with?\nWhen you kept your fat filthy fingers still smelling of cheap tobacco, down there.\nI just couldn't bury myself again.\nSo I had to stab you exactly 15 times,\nto mark the number of years I lamented for.\nLife is good now.\nYour death is my liberation.\nNow,\nI am a free woman, for a few more hours before they punish me for a murder, this brutal.\nBut I swear,\nI am the happiest today.\n.\n~ MONOLOGUE AFTER SHE KILLED HER CULPRIT\n#rape #abuse #children #monologue #prompts #musings #poetrycommunity #afteralongtime #threat #death #warnings  #notolerance #abuse #violence #molestation #abstractart #metoo #stopchildabuse #life #poetsofIG #poetrycommunity #blood #instagood #instagram"

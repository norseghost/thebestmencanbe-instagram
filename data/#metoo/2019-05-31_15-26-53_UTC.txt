Instead of paying lip service to the MeToo movement, Bright Star Schools puts its money where its mouth isâ€”investing in 20+ hours of self defense training for each of our young women prior to graduation.  Many thanks to Dawn North for making this camp happen and to @instagrahmbaker for absorbing a horrifying number of groin kicks. #metoo #metoomovement #selfdefense #selfdefenseforwomen #healthystudents #timesup #schoolsafety #sexualassault #believewomen

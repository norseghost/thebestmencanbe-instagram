Thanks for your instalive @zacharylevi  and for speaking up about trauma. It made me cry because, well, I've been struggling for some years now. 
It's amazing how an actor I l'll never meet or get to know just spoke right into my life moments ago. Not for the first time.
It helps so much. Thank you so much for these honest speaks. 
For remembering me that it's okay to be hurt and anxious and to still move on. That it's about to TRUST through it, because that's true.
Love actually is the only key to everything.
Gby, Zachary.

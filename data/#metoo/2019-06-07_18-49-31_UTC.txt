They are exciting and give you what you’ve always longed for. The relationship builds fast & furious.
.
Except that is NOT how a good relationship builds. It takes time to build intimacy.
.
Relationships w narcissists build at lightening speed. You become best friends and inseparable. They will text you first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Some even text a lot throughout the day. This ensures they are ALWAYS on your mind.
.
This is how attachment builds and will make it very hard for you to leave. Like a drug addict you will crave this attention and “love” (fake love) when they withhold it. You’ll do ANYTHING to feel this intensity again, so you keep going back. You keep improving your behavior. You keep adjusting things so you can keep this amazing intensity which you’ve been fooled into believing is intimacy..

I’m still staring at your ghost. 
It’s taking the shape of a rape trial.
Pictures I don’t remember taking.
You took something of mine do you still remember?
I wonder what you say now I’m not around.
Are you happier?
Did you really hurt me in the way I recall?! I feel like I can’t be right this time. You are too soft. 
It sort of feels like the end of the world.
I think I hate you.
I just wish I could call you I only want to hear your voice.
I think I might still love you.

I’m not sure what to do. - passing thoughts // that have the presence of metorites

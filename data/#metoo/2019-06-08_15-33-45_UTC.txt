This was my first ever modeling shoot! As a wee 20 year old starting of in modeling not having a clue what I was doing ... was I not the luckiest wee girl in the world having @michaelleongofficial and @bazzasnaps looking after me? 
Yes I was! 
As much as I support the 
#metoo campaign, I never was in better hands. Thank you guys for giving me a helping hand into my career, being able to feel safe and able to express myself even though I was a wee country girl and hadn’t a clue what I was doing I will never be able to thank you enough. I look back at this pic with such pride. ❤️

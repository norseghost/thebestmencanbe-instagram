During the delivery of the Golden Globe 2018 Natalie in her speech launched a shortcut on the fact that in the nominations for best director only names of men appeared. I can say that I agree with Natalie, because it is true that there are many good women directors who are not rewarded because of that prejudice, which believes that certain jobs are congenial only to men.
On the internet I had read, that when Natalie had decided to direct, I think A tale of love and Darkness (but I'm not sure it was just that movie) she was told that "Everyone had to do his job" or that an actress she had to be an actress and not leave her field.
A phrase that has bothered me a lot, also because it's not written anywhere, also because an actress can turn out to be a very good director.
I find that Natalie is a very brave woman, also because it takes a lot of courage to expose yourself.
Last thing, then I eclipsed myself since I bored you enough, a round of applause for the clothes sported on the red carpet, strictly black because of the protest against abuses in the world of cinema.

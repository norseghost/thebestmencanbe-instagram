One focus of this community is to dispel SEXUAL ASSAULT MYTHS. These are commonly-held beliefs that play a huge role in nearly every aspect of sexual assault crimes. These myths are so powerful that they are partly to blame for people choosing not to file a report. Theyâ€™re also partly to blame for assault victims not getting the support they need. And these myths also contribute to how trials play out and why so many rapists do not get a guilty verdict or a reasonable sentence. This is a disempowering cyclical process that slows progress toward lasting change.

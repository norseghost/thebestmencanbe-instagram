A new Episode of @drinkinbrospodcast came out about an hour ago, and I talk about some more good/vulgar times in my life. I do have a filter, I just choose to never use it. 
At one point, I tell the story of when I was FORCED to kiss a man; and how he has trolled me on social media over the last 10 years after. It's 2019! I finally get to clear the air after all these years & put a face to the story ðŸ˜‚. Check out my newest episode on Drinkin Bros, and let me know what you think ðŸ‘‡. Link in Bio.

TOP 10 BEST FILMS OF THE 1960s

#5. Rosemary's Baby (1968)

Rosemary's Baby is a perfect movie; expertly plotted and executed, it moves along with unbearable tension until the disturbing truth about Rosemary's baby is revealed. This is horror at its most chilling.
And in the wake of #MeTooÂ Rosemary's Baby feels even more urgent. It becomes less a masterclass of nervous tension and more a feminist study on women's agency and the society that wants to control their bodies. It's a stunning achievement.

The two ladies at the centre of the film command our attention: Mia Farrow fires on all cylinders, as Rosemary disintegrates from optimistic expectant-mother to a bundle of frayed nerves fighting for her safety. And RUTH FUCKING GORDON. What did we do to deserve this performance? Equal parts creepy, hilarious, endearing, and bizarre Ruth Gordon elevates every frame she's in to greatness with a single look or offbeat inflection. Her Mrs. Castevet is nothing short of iconic and should be considered one of the great villains of the horror genre.

Rosemary's Baby is a tour-de-force that is not to be missed.

10/10

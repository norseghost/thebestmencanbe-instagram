Being a candle of love enlightened with hope,
I flutter through the air breezing behind me.
Dim to bright, I'm glowing my light
Though none bothered me at my plight.
My wax got scattered
And now I'm staggered...
Can I standby the breath of wind?

How hard I try, the nature couldn't pay
Crying for a sigh, I fear burning my own hay!

Though I get melted by time,
My flames get to the higher they can.

But, why am I scared?

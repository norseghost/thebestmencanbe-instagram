Thank you @reenaninan and @cbsnews for having me on yesterday to talk about the harassment of women at work. Clearly I am passionate about this issue not only because of my own experiences but because of hearing from so many women about theirs.  When shooting my documentary “Breaking the Silence” I learned how pervasive workplace harrassment is; it exists across all industries and across all genders, races, and socioeconomic levels. To create change we need action. The fastest way is to call your representatives at (202) 224-3121 and make your voice heard! #BeFierce #BreakingTheSilence #MeToo #FightFor15 #TimesUp @timesupnow @fightfor15

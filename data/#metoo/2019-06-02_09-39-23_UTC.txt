After 1.5 month I’m finally back to SUP yesterday. I won’t deny that there’s a moment I thought I can never go back to SUP anymore. But I finally made it. It’s good to paddle with friends that you can trust and no need to worry being sexual harassment. I think at some point, get back to SUP mean I’ve conquer that barrier in my mind, I hope I’m completely reborn. And I just want to say for those girls/boys  who have been there before, feel free to send me a message if you need a listener or need some advise. I’m here for you. #Metoo #saynotosexualharrassment .

QUIET FOR TOO LONG is out today! Solvej Schou’s passionate, loud, and raw album can now be found digitally on CD Baby, iTunes, and Amazon. You can also purchase the LIMITED EDITION red vinyl through CD Baby! Featured in @laweekly as the album of the week, they say “It’s a record that reflects this current political climate: if your nerves aren’t charged and tingling by the end...you aren’t paying attention.” You won’t want to miss Solvej’s record release show at @cafenela where she’ll belt these politically charged tunes alongside @bellanovelamusic and @theletteropeners on Thursday, June 27th!!! #girlpower #riotgrrrl #metoo #womeninmusic #womenempowerment #womenpower #quietfortoolong #solvejschou #womenwhorock #punk #punkgirl #women

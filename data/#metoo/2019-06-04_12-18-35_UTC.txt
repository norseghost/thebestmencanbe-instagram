Did you know that 87-93% of disease comes from our THOUGHTS
.
*Thoughts* become emotions, emotions become attitude. Our attitude is our reaction, and all of our daily reactions make up our *lifestyle.*
.
It all boils down to two kinds of emotions. Love-based (positive) emotions, and fear-based (negative) emotions.
.
Love-based emotions include: love, joy, faith, trust, inner strength, confidence, belief,happiness, caring, sharing, forgiveness, openness, passion, freedom, harmony, honesty, beauty, compassion, self-love, self-appreciation, respect, acceptance, and peace.
.
Fear-based emotions include: fear, anger, disgust, worry, anxiety, frustration, resentment, ill-will, blame, sadness, jealousy, negativity, and stress.
.
Dr. Bradley Nelson from "The Emotion Code" said "A trapped emotion is literally a ball of energy, and these will lodge anywhere in the body and disrupt the normal energy field of the body."
.
Sounds crazy, but it makes sense! Our emotions are stored in different parts of our body.
.
Anger is stored in the Liver & Gallbladder.
Worry is stored in the Stomach.
.
Grief is stored in the Lungs (ever experienced grief that felt like it took all the breath out of your lungs?)
.
Fear is stored in the Kidneys.
.
Stress is stored in the Heart.
.
I especially relate to worry, fear, and stress.
.

“WHEN I SAY I FORGIVE YOU, 
KNOW THIS
I did not bury the hatchet. 
I have the hatchet in my hands.
I am building myself a new house”
— @brennatwohy 
Today marks 3 years since I broke up with my abuser and just thinking about the fact that I DID THAT is still unreal to me. I never thought I’d ever get the guts to leave.
——————————————
During the first few weeks after, I was diagnosed with Acute Stress Disorder (often a precursor to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and then a few months later, I was officially diagnosed with PTSD. I spent so many nights sobbing on the floor, absolutely terrified of everything. ————————————————-————
I ended up still living with her in that tiny one bedroom apartment for about another month after we broke up (which was as awful as it sounds) and then once I found a new place to live, I had to pay for my half of the bills for the old apartment (because that lease wasn’t up until September lol) AND the bills for my new one. I was very broke and very exhausted, but it was a step towards freedom. ————————————
Eventually, I reported her to my school via Title IX (the specific charges she faced were domestic violence and sexual assault), but the entire process was a joke and all it did was give her protection (school officials told me I couldn’t tell anyone about the violence I’d endured or warn anyone unless I wanted to be charged with “retaliation”). That set me back a lot. I was constantly in panic mode and I saw her basically every day on campus until I left town that spring (shout-out to all the times she showed up at Blackbird Coffee while I was doing various group projects and couldn’t leave). —————————————
Currently, my mental health is still pretty messy and I honestly haven’t forgiven my abuser, but I have forgiven myself. It wasn’t my fault that she continued to hurt me and traumatize me. It wasn’t my fault that I didn’t know I deserved better for so long. I’m still angry at her, and I probably always will be to some extent— but that’s okay. My anger helped push me to leave. My anger saved me. Here’s to 3 years of growth and healing. Heres to finally being able to speak up. Here’s to building a new goddamn house. 🏡 💜

Perfectly  stated @Regrann from @malaika_vision - ðŸ˜¼Hey Alabama GOP this ones for youðŸ˜¡Back off our bodies bruhs. They are not under your jurisdiction.ðŸ¦…
I canâ€™t even with this country rn yall I am livid. Itâ€™s the combo of all the things on top of one another, where Trumps crazy coup has infiltrated all levels of Govâ€™t like an infectious disease. ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜­Remembering to breathe. But also remembering that anger is totally rational in the face of these double standards. Perhaps itâ€™s possible to alchemize that anger into positive action. Because I am done with inaction-itâ€™s not working! We gotta get re-centered and organized if we wanna stand up strong to this patriarchal avalanche of bullðŸ’© DM if your ready to collaborate on some political performance art.

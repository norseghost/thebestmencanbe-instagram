How to Be a Woman in a Manâ€™s World (6/6)

I write this post not to malign this particular individual or those who have behaved in this manner, but to educate because this culture of imbalanced gender dynamics is so ingrained in both men and women in today's society. Still, in the age of #metoo, it is very difficult to talk about topics that are related to this movement and this subject because of the controversy it provokes. But there are so many women who find themselves in situations where they still feel completely blindsided, as I was and feel that they are unable to take action. .

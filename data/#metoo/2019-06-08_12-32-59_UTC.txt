How is the pivoting going? 😉 As I have been working on continuing to change my own thought processes this past year, I have noticed that when I hit a bump in my plans, I immediately tell myself “pivot, it’s time to pivot”. And then I smile when I think of this scene from “Friends”.

Because I do this does it mean that I don’t get frustrated or upset when my plans of action don’t work out?  Absolutely not.  What I have found though is that I spend less time being upset, I don’t get off track, and it’s easier for me to find other options/solutions.  If you haven’t yet tried, do so.  It does take practice, but so does everything else we are learning 💜

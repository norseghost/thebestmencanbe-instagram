Good Morning My Fierce Fabulous Family  its simply Saturday here's Today's quote . Our world is a paradise with wonders lurking in every corner of it. If you are just a bit more aware and grateful for the surroundings, you will discover beauty in everything. Life does not have to be dull or morose when there is a bright sun greeting you every morning, cool breeze caressing your face and lovely nature surrounding you. Take comfort in a starry night with moon to cradle you to sleep. This is natureâ€™s love for us and it is present everywhere and every day.

I had an amazing time today at the @safe_bae consent conference hosted on SMCCâ€™s campus. I met so many amazing individuals and I absolutely loved seeing so many people come together to have conversations around topics as important as ending sexual assault and helping victims subjected to it. This conference went above and beyond all my expectations!

I learned so much about LGBTQ+ bullying and sexual assault statistics as well as ways to help cope and deal with past trauma, something I definitely think helped me to continue my healing process.
Food was amazing there as well, and so was the view of the beach (that we also got to go explore).

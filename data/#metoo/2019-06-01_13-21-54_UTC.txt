Brandi Miller (@brandinico) sits with songwriters of “He Has Time” and unravel the story behind a song that was written, in part, by two survivors of sexual abuse. They discuss the #MeToo movement and the importance of having open discussion about abuse and why the church should be far less reluctant to engage in the bigger conversation surrounding this, and other challenging subject matters. In this clip, Brandi gives a powerful, moving closing address to those who’ve been abused and those still processing the significance of this moment, this movement in history.

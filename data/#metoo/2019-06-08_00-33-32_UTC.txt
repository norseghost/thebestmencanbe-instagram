Dear Dumbass Capitalists, 
This is why I’ve said that taxing the rich is a good idea. People are dying and they’ve got so much, that they don’t even know what to do with it. Like, they don’t even reinvest into their own companies! Rather than relying on rich people, who have consistently screwed poor people throughout history, why don’t we give that unused money to the poor that need it and make everyone’s lives better? I feel like that’s a great idea and it’s much better than that “Trickle Down” bullshit that y’all keep raving about. 
Sincerely, 
Someone with Common Sense. —————————————————————————— —————————————————————————— #feminist #abortion #prolife #prochoice #feminism #womensrights #gop #republican #birthcontrol #contraceptive #condom #politics #guns #guncontrol #immigrants #refugees #murder #liberal #conservative #racisminamerica #whiteprivilege #democrat #socialism #capitalism #metoo #rapevictim #rapeculture #gunviolence #fucktrump #impeachtrump

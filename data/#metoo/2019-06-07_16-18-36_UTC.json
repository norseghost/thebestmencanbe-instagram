We went to see an elderly man who had many problems. It was time to remove his urinary catheter. I stood next to the resident to watch the removal & learn. He pulled it out quickly & sloppily, flinging it in such a way that it splattered blood & urine all over my face & clothes.\n\nI was mortified. He laughed and walked away.\n\nI stood there with my mind racing; having no idea what diseases this patient had and what microorganisms I may have been exposed to.\n\nI did my best to clean up. I didn\u2019t have another hijab or a change of clothes. It was so humiliating.\n\nI had to spend the rest of the day with this resident. He never once apologized.\n\nAbuse, #misogyny, & #bigotry in medical training are real. This is one small story that happened to me but I\u2019ve heard countless from others.\n\nThe recent scandal in the USC Cardiology department with a fellow sexually assaulting an intern is horrifying; more so its mishandling is appalling.  We must speak out. We must stamp this out.\n\nSadly I never told anyone what happened to me. I felt like a dumb #medicalstudent & wanted to hide. But it tells you something that almost 20 years later I remember the incident vividly. One cannot imagine how sexual assault victims feel even decades later.\n\nNow I wonder how many other ppl that same guy abused & in what ways. I assumed he targeted me because of my #hijab & maybe something about the way I carried myself. Victims often blame themselves & that\u2019s part of why they remain quiet.\n\nSilence is not the solution. It takes courage to speak out so we have to support one another in doing it.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#silentnomore #speakout\n.\n.\n."

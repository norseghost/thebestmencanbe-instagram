Guava ice cream, guava jam, raw guava with dulce de leche, biscuit de polvilho( manioc grissini or yucca biscuit), parmesan cheese or any white cheese such as burrata or minas frescal, fleur du sel, olive oil and basil leaves.

I keep this recipe in mind every Valentine's day

Here is the ice cream recipe:

Two or three red ripe guavas, turned into a puree in a food processor and sieved, to make it smooth and even.
Add 1 cup Monin ginger syrop and 2 cups President Chantilly Cream. Mix gently until even.
Grease ice cubes with olive oil and pour the guava mixture. Freeze overnight and serve.

Guava jam and dulce de leche are found in the market (Brazilian Products. Stores) Do not use guava marmelade for it is too sweet. Preferably display small pieces of the ingredients. Do not overload.

Good luck

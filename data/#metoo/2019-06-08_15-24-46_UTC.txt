⚠️ long post/triggering content ⚠️ I look a little different now. Most days I still feel like the picture on the left. •
I don’t know if your surgery team prepared you for the mental battle of losing weight. I’ve honestly considered going to therapy to deal with the psychological reasons why I got to almost 300 pounds. •
I was abused as a child, both physically and sexually. This abused lasted years and was committed by several different men that my mother allowed into our lives. Gaining weight became my armor. The more I gained the less interested they became in me.
•
Losing weight means I’m losing that armor. I’m getting attention from men for the first time in my adult life. It’s scary and exciting at the same time. I won’t allow myself to be a victim to the things that happened to me. •
I’m grateful for the men in my life that have made me feel safe, secure, and loved. You know who you are. ❤️ #sexualabuse #speakout #breakthesilence #metoo #mentalhealthisimportant #vsg #wls #vsgjourney #wlsjourney #vsgcommunity #wlscommunity #vsginstacrew #wlsinstacrew

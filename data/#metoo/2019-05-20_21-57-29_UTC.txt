I consider myself a foodie, but I'm really just a fatty. I came here after checking menus of different restaurants and declaring it a winner. Thai food is average. I was looking forward to the fish and chips, but it wasn't crispy or crunchy. In fact it had more of a microwaved texture which was disappointing. It didn't help that there were many ants on the table.

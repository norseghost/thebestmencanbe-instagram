This evil bitch falsely accused five Black boys who were eventually  convicted of brutally raping a white female jogger named Trisha Meili. Meili spent 12 days in a coma and woke up with zero recollection of the attack.\n\nWhat\u2019s ill is that Meili firmly believes the Central Park Five were not wronged by the NYPD or the Manhattan DA\u2019s office. This broad insists the police and DA didn\u2019t violate the #CP5 rights despite their 40 million wrongful conviction settlement or the confession of serial rapist Matias Reyes. Not only do these women refuse to acknowledge the innocence of these men, they both published very successful books and reap the financial benefit of one of the biggest racial injustices in the last 30 years.\n\nThis goes to show that not only do white women benefit from the oppression of Black and Latino men, they are also active players in perpetration of said oppression. Way before #MeToo, it was #JustUs Black men being lynched and jailed over white women\u2019s lies and misconduct. Historical events like the death of Emmitt Till and the massacre in Rosewood, Florida were engineered by white women lying on Black men. I\u2019m so happy #WhenTheySeeUs was released because white women are still lying and the criminal justice system is just as racially bias as it was in 1989 (see #KaliefBrowder and #ChanelLewis). As long as white women view Black and Brown boys as \u201csuper predators\u201d they\u2019ll continue to wrongfully convicted by a racially unjust justice system.\n\u2022\n\n#ChangingTheNarrative IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY #50cent #StephCurry #Lebron #Beyonce #Jayz  #cardib #WillSmith #TI #Worldstar #getthestrap #Hiphop #nickiminaj #migos #kodakblack #pressplay #nipseyhussle #nic"

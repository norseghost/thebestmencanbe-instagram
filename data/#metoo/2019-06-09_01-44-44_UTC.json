Please know I am okay, I'm safe and I'm coming out of the dark place where I hide with my pain. I'm learning I never should hide again. In all honesty, I've been really struggling and I often forget that I do have the strength to overcome this. \nI plan to use this account as a sort of visual journey for self discovery and reclaiming the things I feel I have lost from within myself.\n\nI'm going to be open and honest about the things I am comfortable with sharing, things that are personal to me and not involving others.\n\n@jbdfam will remain active for sharing snaps of Brooklyn and Darcy's lives. Please follow there if you just want day to day stuff. \nThis account will be 100% Jess. \nNot holding back, not feeling ashamed of who I am or what I do, or what I like, or dislike, or what I believe, and what I have lived through.\n\nGet to know me for real. \nNo more people hanging around waiting for a version of Jess that they can tolerate. It's me or nothing \ud83c\udf39\n\nSo...\nI might post 1000x a day or not at all for weeks\nI will talk about my opinions and beliefs\nI will explore my personal history, my heritage, my culture, my memories, and my mind.\nI will talk about the environment and what I believe we can and should do for it\nI will talk about animals and why I am vegan\nI will talk about textile waste and fast fashion and my journey to understand ethical consumerism\n\nI will talk about my mental and physical health\n\nI will talk about #metoo\n\nI will share obscure nerdy references that nobody understands\nI will be sarcastic and satirical\nI will be happy and energetic\nI will be depressed \nI will be clean and glowing\nI will be a messy train wreck\nI will sing\nI will cry\nI will be an adult and a mother\nI will be immature and childish\nI will be nostalgic\nI will daydream and fantasize about the future\nI will share nice things\nI will share not very nice things\n\nI will be honest.\nI will be me.\n\n#rediscoveringmyself #recovery #mentalhealthawareness #metoo #endthestigma #bpd #youmatter #lifecanbegoodagain"

Not a Victim 
Only surviving.
One of the many challenges that women face when coming out and speaking their truth is:
1. Risking your identity 
2. People no believing 
3. Getting harassed 
4. People telling you to stop talking about it and to “Let it go”. 5. Suffering from PTSD
6. Attempting suicide or having suicidal thoughts
7. Isolation 
8. Fears and Phobias 
9. Insomnia 
10. Alcohol/ Drug Abuse 
11. Fear of intimacy or having trouble of establishing healthy relationships.
12. Repeating unhealthy patterns.
13. And this list goes on..... The lack of sympathy is unfortunately the truth for a lot of survivors. Which is why small or large communities that allow women to reach out and seek help is so important. We want to heal. We want justice. And most importantly to have closure and move forward. 
Build your communities, reach out to people who genuinely care and support. Don’t down play a situation, every survivor has value and EVERY story is matters. 
Make YOU a priority.
Make YOUR voice heard.
Make EVERY appointment to heal. 
Find your passion in art, music, reading, writing & anything that makes you feel empowered ✊🏾✊🏽✊🏻✊🏽✊🏿

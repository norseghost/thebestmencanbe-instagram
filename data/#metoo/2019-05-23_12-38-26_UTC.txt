EXPECTATION. A powerful word with a heavy meaning, one of the things we most struggle with when we are younger. Trying to live up to what people expect from you or what people think you must be doing or is "better" or "suits you" is the real challenge when you are in the process of discovering yourself.

Always remember that life is a one way ticket, the decisions that you make maybe will please FOR NOW the people around you but you are the only one that will have to deal with it for the rest of your life.

Don't be afraid to speak your own mind, don't let fear make you take safe choices. Let your heart drive you to your path of hapiness, nobody will do it for you.

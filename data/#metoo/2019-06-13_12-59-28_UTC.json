Maybe it\u2019s not #objectifying to #women\n\nWe live in a world where so many people are accepting of what they see and read. It seems so many are easily swayed by the way some #celebrities #influencers and the #kardashians communicate. \nMaybe it\u2019s meant to be #alluring or #sexy. It could be said it\u2019s #cultural or it\u2019s just #kitchy not to be offensive.\n\nMaybe it started as just a cool #marketingstrategy by men in suits on a #whiteboard in the #warroom in an attempt to #empower women to spend more money on #plasticsurgery in the pursuit of looking like a beautiful doll.\n\nI \u2764\ufe0f the #aesthetic industry. Helping  others look and feel their best is amazing and rewarding in countless way. I have great respect for the #plasticsurgeons who care deeply about their #patients and who focus on #safety #service and #outcomes \nI don\u2019t consider myself a #feministactivist however I can\u2019t help but notice that it seems odd that it would be okay to refer to female plastic surgery patients as dolls. \nWhat message are we sending as #mothers and #fathers to our #daughters and to our #sons. Are we okay with referring to women as dolls?\n\nI will always be a raving fan of #cosmeticsurgery and truly believe that most of us who work in this industry are in it for the right reasons and have a true understanding of what it can do positively for quality of life. I also think that we as industry professionals have to draw the line on what we consider acceptable and start holding our colleagues to a higher standard of integrity. \nIf you disagree, I\u2019m not offended. Unfollow, keep scrolling, whatever-I\u2019m one opinion in a world of 7 billion. If you agree with me than take a step to separate yourself from what takes away from all that\u2019s good in the aesthetic industry. If we all agree to be #leaders not #followers we can get back to what\u2019s good. \nSincerely, Michelle Emmick @theplasticsurgerycoach"

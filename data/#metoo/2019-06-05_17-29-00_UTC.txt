THIS THURSDAY AT SAVVY: Rosalyn D’Mello 
In her talk „A Case of Consideration“, @rosad1985 seeks to institute into public discourse an alternative, more empowering feminist whisper network, that is not exclusively premised on the protective gesture of listing serial oppressors or predators but is instead more consciously a system of sustaining hope through an investment in the written word as a form of proliferating palimpsest. 
Rosalyn is a writer, art critic and feminist columnist based in New Delhi. She is the author of "A Handbook for My Lover", and a forthcoming artist book "The Domestic Nomad“. Rosalyn will participate in our Long Night on Partition and Partitura with a lecture.

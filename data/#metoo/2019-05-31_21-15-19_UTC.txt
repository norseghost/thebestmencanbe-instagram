Thank you to @tlcbooktours and @redhenpress for my copy of this book! What a powerful story packed into about 200 pages. This book is incredibly relevant to today‚Äôs society and culture. This book will surely stir up a lot of emotions within each reader. It‚Äôs truly eye opening how many people one unfortunate act can really effect. This story is no different. It may be hard to read for some but definitely worth picking up üíï‚Å£‚Å£

Nora Buchbinder--formerly rich and now broke--would be the last woman in Brooklyn to claim #MeToo, but when a work assignment reunites her with her childhood best friend, Beth, she finds herself in a hall of mirrors. Was their eighth grade teacher Beth's lover or her rapist? Where were the grown-ups? What should justice look like, after so much time has passed? And what can Nora do, now?‚Å£‚Å£

Nora's memories, and Beth's, and those of their classmates, their former teacher, and members of his family, bring to light some of the ways we absorb and manage unbearable behavior. From denial to reinvention, self-pity to self-righteousness, endless questioning to intransigent certainty, readers will recognize the ripples sent into the lives of others by one broken man. #thequestionauthority

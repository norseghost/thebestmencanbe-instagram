This is beyond partisan politics.\nCongress must do what they are constitutionally bound to do \u2014 and begin impeachment proceedings.\nAnd we, the public, must do what is morally right\u2026 and support removing this man from the presidency. #dirtydonald is below the dignity of the office and profoundly unfit to hold it.\nWe must keep our eyes open\u2026 and not shut our mouths when we see corruption and injustice in plain sight. \nKeep track of those in office who still support the \u201cpresident\u201d now that the Mueller Report is being made public \u2014 and remember them in November, 2020.\nDon\u2019t forget\u2026\nWE THE PEOPLE have the power. \nWE can #VOTE to end all of this vile insanity and restore normalcy. \nOur country was fooled once. \nIn 2020, more than ever, voters will want substance. #Trump will come up empty there. People want candidates who can deal with real issues\u2026 not those only capable of creating fake emergencies\u2026 The 2018 midterms were a step in the right direction\u2026 now we need the #WhiteHouse and Senate in 2020...

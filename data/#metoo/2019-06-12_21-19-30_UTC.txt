IT’S BEEN A MINUTE! Our team has taken a short hiatus to dig deep and find ways to really elevate our community. .
Much of that work lately has been conversations around safe practices in our theatre community. Join us JUNE 22nd for a time of action. To come together as a community to make change and prevent further sexual violence and assault in our arts community. 
Event info in bio. We would love to have you!!! ❤️ .

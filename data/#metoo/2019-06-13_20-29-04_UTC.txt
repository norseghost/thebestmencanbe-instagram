To whom it may concern: tell us again why you “had to.” It’s not just women targeted, it’s men, children, and the LGBTQ+ community. It is everyone. It’s not about what you look like, what you wear, or where you’re from (though sometimes it may be.)There may not even be a ‘why’ in why he/she/they chose you. We didn’t do anything wrong here. It wasn’t about us. #abuse #artistsoninstagram #metoo #everyone

The thing about Jesus that really gets to me is that he waits for us. He waits with open arms though he sees that we continually choose our sin over Him. It's as if He stands there saying "choose me. I'm your way out of this." He says, "Come as you are! I know it's hard but I will help you!" He helps us people! Please know that you are not alone. Please know that you have help no matter how "in-over-your-head" you are! NOTHING is impossible for the creator of the universe! I repeat,  NOTHING NOTHING NOT A THING is impossible for OUR God! 
Feeling lost?
Confused?
Broken?
Afraid?
Call on the name of Jesus my friend! He is your  help. 
Much love

Earlier this week, the 'Mother and Child' sculpture, commemorating the Lai Dai Han, was unveiled by Nadia Murad, the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize winner, at Church House, Westminster. 
The sculpture is available to view, along with an exhibition on the Vietnam War and the Lai Dai Han, at the gallery at 10 Hanover Street in central London, and will remain there for the next six weeks. 
If you missed the unveiling of the sculpture, you can watch it on our website - Link in bio!

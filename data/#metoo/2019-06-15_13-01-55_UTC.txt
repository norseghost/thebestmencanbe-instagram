the ones that are cut off bc I'm bad at editing read: "h&m uses sweat shops"
"mango 1135 dead in the savar building collapse"
"Levi's uses abrasive blasting killing workers"
"river island pays its workers half the minimum wage"
these are shops that advertise with feminist messages about equality while hypocritically treating workers poorly. it doesnt mean stop shopping at these places, but that it is wrong for them to exploit workers while profiting from those who want equality.

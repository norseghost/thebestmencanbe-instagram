😢 Ellen DeGeneres recently opened up about sexual assault she experienced as a teen at the hands of her stepfather. During an interview on @letterman’s Netflix series, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, DeGeneres says she was assaulted by him when she was about 15 or 16 and that he used her mother’s mastectomy as logic for what he did. “And I didn't want to tell my mother, 'cause I was protecting her and I knew that that would ruin her happiness...And I didn't tell her for a few years, and then I told her. And then she didn't believe me. And then she stayed with him for 18 more years. And finally left him because he'd changed the story so many times." Thank you @theellenshow for being brave and vulnerable and sharing your story with the world. 👏🏻 You are a survivor, you are respected, and you are 🌟 amazing! 📷: Jason Kempin/Getty Images.

I don't know what this sun is outside trying to prove, but whatever it is, YOU WON!!! HOLD YOUR HANDS UP CHAMP!!! UNDEFEATED, UNDESPUTED. Yesterday was a TKO. Today we are tapping out. Florida does not give you consent anymore so please kindly back off sir. Where is the #metoo movement for the sunshine state? You have wild animals out here knocking on peoples doors trying to get away from you. You are costing us money by making our light bill double. We need you, and love you, but the abuse must stop. 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵☀️☀️☀️☀️🌡🌡🌡🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

From getting turned away from shelters, to staying in abusive relationships because our bodies are \"confusing\" or \"unlovable,\" the increase in visibility\u00a0over the past few years has not protected us. \nTrans women are the most likely to be murdered, and meanwhile trans men are the most likely to commit suicide.\u00a0Many trans men and assigned female at birth trans people do not speak on their survivor status. \nAs an assigned female at birth trans person, I have been told many times that both my gender and sexual orientation are the result of my childhood abuse. This is not true. In fact, I would have come out much earlier as transgender had I not had my body and boundaries constantly policed. \nI would have come out much earlier about being a survivor had I not had to worry about having my identity scrutinized or limited to womanhood.\" \u00b7\n\u00b7\n#toimagazine #sexualassault #lgbt #lgbtq #lgbtq\ud83c\udf08 #trans #sexualassaultawareness #recovery #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #metoo"

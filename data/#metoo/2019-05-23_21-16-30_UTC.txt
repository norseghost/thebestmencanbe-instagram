I used to sing in the room you committed sodomy in shit there’s still kids singing in that room. A mentor who had my hole future in store
Who taught me the whole musical score. Who gave it all up because of a pregnancy scare with minor in a choir room chair. 
You were soon to be in jail my cousin was already there and heard about the whole affair. You clam at the end she was going to say it was rap if you dint keep fucking her ugly face. What were you ? Some 34-year-old bitch who couldn’t handle his shit who cheated on his wife and two kids by taking advantage of a 12 year-old kid who was sexually confused.
Shit I’ll never forget when I heard you were going to prison for 20 years.  I had a panic attack in the middle of summer camp. I couldn’t breath for 10 mins I felt like the hours and hours I spent with you perfecting my voice was no longer something to be proud of I was confused my brain was totally knocked loose. I couldn’t even comprehend the news. I looked up to you. You were my place of escape my “safe place”my every day getaway. 
You showed me a musical way to live out every day. 
Now your legacy will be nothing but shame. 
You brought me to a defining place.
I had to learn to give up on the illusion of ultimate Grace  I had to learn to cope with the world in my grief when everyone else seem to just forget about The name B . I was angry constantly
 I was totally messed up psychologicaly . 
Worst part about it was the girl you screwed would just walk around and talk about it like it was fake news almost bragging about what had happened between you two. 
I think they should’ve have put her in jail to.
At least for a couple years so she can learn some remorse and not to run her mouth without any thought of recourse. 
But of course she talks free because consent mean something different when you’re not 18.  I hope it haunts her dreams like it haunts my #dreams. .......... #angry #recovery #mentor #experience #jail #Legacy #shame #rap #rant #pro #poetry #spokenword #miners #corruption #seduction #metoo

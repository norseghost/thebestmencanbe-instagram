Repost âœ¨ This weekend, the Monument Quilt blanketed the National Mall with 3,000 stories from survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence. Thousands of people attended to bear witness to our stories. Our community joined together in learning, healing, communing, connecting, to end rape culture and white supremacy.

We mourned, we celebrated our resilience, we planted seeds of hope for our future resistance. This weekend, we truly experienced that we are not alone.

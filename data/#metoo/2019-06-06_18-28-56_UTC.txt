Queen Rania obtained her Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from the American University of Cairo in 1991. She then started working hard to improve the lives of Jordanians by supporting their endeavours and creating new opportunities for them. She is an advocate for tolerance, compassion, and bridge building between people of all cultures and backgrounds. Her efforts to simultaneously challenge stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims and promote greater understanding and acceptance between people of all faiths and cultures, have won her global recognition. In recognition of her work, Her Majesty has humbly accepted many awards, locally, regionally and globally. ———-

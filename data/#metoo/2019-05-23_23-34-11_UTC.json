                        "text": "THE WAR ON WOMEN\u2800\nWhen the punishment for aborting your rapist\u2019s fetus is more severe than the punishment for rape, you know there\u2019s a war against women. In Alabama, 25 white male Republicans voted to ban abortion in the state of every stage of pregnancy unless the mother\u2019s physical or mental health is in jeopardy.  A dozen states this year have passed or attempted to pass stricter abortion laws. Ever since Trump got Gorsuch and, God forbid, despicable Kavanaugh,  on the stacked Supreme Court, conservatives are betting that these bans will lead to lawsuits that overturn Roe v Wade which recognizes a woman\u2019s constitutional right to an abortion. \u2800\nThe most ironic contradiction of the pro-lifers is their horrific record of anti-life violence. In the 47 years since Roe v Wade was passed, there have been 11 murders and 26 attempted murders due to anti\u2014abortion violence. More than 17 people have been maimed or seriously injured. More than 7,200 acts of violence have been perpetrated, including kidnappings, stalking, vandalism arsons, fire bombings bioterrorism threats assaults and death threats. \u2800\nThe farthest right of conservatives want America to be a theocracy and modify our laws after their own religion. The next attack on the agenda is to severely restrict or eliminate birth control. The most strident of Evangelical Christians believe that men should have control over women and the most ardent aspect of this control seems to be women\u2019s sexuality. They want to take away our very right of body autonomy. This, my friends, is a war on women. We cannot allow it to prevail. We can't let this happen to us, our daughters, grand-daughters and those to come. We\u2019ve got to tell these old, rich, white men to keep their hands off our wombs. Women and all those who actually respect and love them, and all those who actually respect and love the Constitution need to fight back. Make noise, make calls, protest, get involved. We MUST go blue in 2020. @blueravenartist\u2800"

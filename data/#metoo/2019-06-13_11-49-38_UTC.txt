There is always this feeling of jumbled up nerves on the days and hours prior to a performance.
The fear of messing up, stumbling and mumbling across the stage - especially when it is a solo. 
With ‘Umrao&Me’, I have always felt all of the above but there is also this sweet anxiety within me that somewhere in the middle of the performance, Umrao will join me - humour me, mock me, laugh with me and guide me to convey her angst and story.

As she wisely says, I have to tell her story, my story and our story - again and again and again.  To different people, in different voices, through different lenses.
 So here we go again, 14 & 15 June at CCAmstel, Amsterdam, telling tales of agency, intimacy, sexuality and politics of a body of a female performer.
 Join us if you can.  Yours faithfully, Umrao&Me.

As I mentioned before, there are hundreds of popular hashtags, all with the same motive. Hashtag activism gives people who donâ€™t feel that they have a voice or an impact, a platform to speak their minds. The next hashtag that I have chosen to show is the #metoo movement.  This movement started in 2006 and has grown immensely since then. Thousands of people everywhere use this hashtag to show their support behind it.

The #metoo movement is designed to help people, particularly black women, who have experienced sexual harassment or sexual assault. This hashtag represents the support system that these victims have on their journey to healing. Not only does it support them, but it encourages them to not be afraid to share their story. The #metoo movement has started a necessary and important conversation about sexual harassment and assault. It has made people feel more comfortable to come forth and discuss this issue. Overall, it has brought a much needed awareness to the topic.

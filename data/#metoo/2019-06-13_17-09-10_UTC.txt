A part of a message from my victim advocate assigned in Strampel's case:
.
"You just never really know why jurors make the decisions they do or what happens behind the doors of that deliberation room. Regardless, this is a huge win and a message all across the nation that treating women this way will not be tolerated. I hope youâ€™re proud to have been a part of this."
.
Yes, after a day of processing everything, today, I am proud.

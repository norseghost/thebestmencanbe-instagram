Forgive me
Forgive my past
It’s quite rough

Forgive my body
It’s been quite used 
Forgive my trust issues
They have been thrown through the mud

Forgive my heart 
it’s been pulled apart if a few times

Forgive my soul 
It’s tired and worn 
Forgive my mind
It’s been twisted and blurred for far too long

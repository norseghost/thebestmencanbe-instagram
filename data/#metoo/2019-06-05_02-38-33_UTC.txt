I relive the fear, the pain everyday. Always scared, always on my guard. 
And to this day my body feels dirty.
Everyone is fighting a battle you don’t know about. Please be kind. Be kind to others and be kind to yourself. ✨🦋 I know life is hard.
I know sometimes you feel like giving up on yourself. 
I know you have good days and bad days but more bad than good or so it seems. 
I know everyday you question yourself 'What is this all for?', 'Am i making the right choices?' or ‘Am i suppose to be here, now?', ‘Why did they let me survive?’.
I know you have more questions than answers and most of the time you don't even know how to explain them. 
I know life is hard, but you have to keep going. 
You have to rise above the waters of your soul, and bloom, no matter how hot the fire is. 
No matter how many arrows you carry on your back, believe me, you're a warrior. 
You're a soilder filled with both pain and love. 
And life, well, life is just another beast you were meant to tame and there is no one better for the job, other than you. 
KIA KAHA 💪🏻

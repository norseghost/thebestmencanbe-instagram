Fallen movie executive Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein have reached a $44 million settlement after they were named in a lawsuit that accused them of sexual harassment, sexual abuse and coercion, and gender discrimination.

It’s not clear who actually filed the lawsuit, but celebrities like Lupita Nyong’o, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, Minka Kelly, and Gwyneth Paltrow were just a handful of the dozens who came forward with accusations against him.

Though he reached the settlement, he has MORE upcoming trials and legal woes from other accusers. #celebrities #celebritynews #metoo #metoomovement #harveyweinstein #bobweinstein #lupitanyongo #sexualassault #salmahayek #angelinajolie #minkakelly #gwynethpaltrow #somelikeithaute #teonnyspears #louisianablogger #justice

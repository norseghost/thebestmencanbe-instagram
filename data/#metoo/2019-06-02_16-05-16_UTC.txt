Got an opinion on that?

Good.

Women’s voices have been quashed, stomped on, silenced, demonised and mocked for many many years.

Let’s stop only hearing men’s voices in meetings, in government, at the board meeting, on TV, in court, on sports channels, in Congress.

Your opinion matters. Be strong, take on the debate, take on the critique. Speak up.

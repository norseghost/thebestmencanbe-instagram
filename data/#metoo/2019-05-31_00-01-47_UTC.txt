Our Beyond Those Bars girls class performed for their parents last night and they went in.  I’m so proud of them, they worked hard on their song/performance . We were in the mirror for hours working on their set, and they didn’t disappoint.  I love what i do, it bring me joy.  Their music video will be released next week stay tuned.  Prod by @prodbytwano and the girls!!

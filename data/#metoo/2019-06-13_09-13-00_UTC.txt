Today it's It Happened Quiet 😶 As Aurora stated about the meaning, it depends on a listener how deep they can dive in the song. I did a bit of a research for each song and I found that this song might be about rape and revenge, which in my opinion and experience fits the lyrics quite well. I used lines under the eyes as tears, line across the mouth to represent the silence and a victim not being able to speak. Feathers show innocence and fragility and bird on a forhead is an african symbol meaning "learn from the past" because that's what is the most important thing about moving on - to accept what happened, accept that this is a part of your story, but the situation itself stays in the past, and you are here. You are living now, you're beautiful and strong. 🧡

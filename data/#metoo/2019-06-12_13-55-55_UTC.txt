I believe everything truly happens for a reason in our lives. The set backs, the heart breaks, the long lonely road of uncertainties at times which forces us to reflect about ourselves from within & it teaches us to enjoy our own company too. I understand the mindset of ‚Äúget money‚Äù and wanting a luxurious lifestyle but for me being wealthy and being rich doesn‚Äôt make us happy. Money is just an energy that some use as power to leverage, distract or try to manipulate those genuinely trying to achieve their Dreams without compromising their morals & sell their soul to the devil. Becoming rich and being rich is giving back to the underprivileged. The needs of the poor, homeless and voiceless are endless in our world. So life is about our services for others. Instead of ignoring a hungry person you help them; instead of ignoring an abuse animal you help them. There‚Äôs been recent events in my life that showed me kind, compassionate and loving people still exist. I am one of them. ‚ù§Ô∏èüåû#shine #beautiful #spirituality #blessings #healthylifestyle #heart #vegan #metoo #timesup #kittens #rescuedog #rescue #dogmoms #compassion #dreambig #loveyou #love #luna #moon #survivor #sunrise #truth #integrity #intuition #payitforward #hummingbird #humanitarian

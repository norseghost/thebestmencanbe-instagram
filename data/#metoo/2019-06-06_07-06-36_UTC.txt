Great talk tonight! @celestebarber and @jameelajamilofficial covered a wide range of topics, from Celeste’s book CHALLENGE ACCEPTED, her rise as an IG star and influencer, the danger of growing complacent with #MeToo, body positivity, #hothusband and much more. And they kept everyone laughing too. 
PS: Don’t forget to use “duck’s nuts” and “dolphin’s earrings.” @livetalksla @amazonpublishing #celestechallengeaccepted #iweigh @thegoodplacenbc

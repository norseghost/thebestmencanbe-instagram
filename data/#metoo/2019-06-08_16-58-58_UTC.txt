When the symptoms are too much to bear, I withdraw and isolate myself from a world that feels scary and overwhelming.” ||You are not alone|| • ||Link in bio|| #strength #speakup #speakout #sasc #consent #columbussasc #colga #columbus #georgia #believesurvivors #youarenotalone #metoo #whyididntreport #rainn #sexualassault #sexualviolence #believe #hope #sexualassault #sexualviolencesurvivors #domesticviolence #victimadvocate #nonprofit #inspiration #trauma #ptsd #domesticviolence #dvawareness

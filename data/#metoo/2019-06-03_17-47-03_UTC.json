So obviously, I never saw his toxic traits as \"toxic\" and I never understood what he was doing and why he did it. All I know is I always had an excuse for his abusive behaviour. It is now, months after therapy I see everything for what it is.\n\nHe would use my body for his needs, EVEN THOUGH I KEPT SAYING that I DO NOT consent to this but he kept forcing himself on me. Every time I would confront him with this, he'd apologise and promise to not do it again but of course he did it again. It got to a point where I was mentally exhausted with his behaviour and I  just let him do it, JUST SO he would let me go. If I didn't let him, he'd hold onto me so tight it'd hurt me. \nI just wanted him to let me go, I didn't want any of the physical activities. but I didn't report any of this because I'm still confused if this is an attempt at rape? Or am I to be blamed for something here? I have contemplated many times about what I \"could\" have done to stop it, but it all comes back to the point where he just wouldn't let go till he was \"done\". I was always, never left with an option but to submit.. and I really don't know how to face the courts with this. The thought of \"tum thi hi ku uske sath?!\" \"Akele jane ko kis ne kaha tha\" haunts me everyday and I don't have the strength to hear that I lost a case where my body was used against my will because I don't have enough proof that whether I ever said \"NO\" clearly or not.\n#whydidntireport #whyikeptquiet #metoo #timesup\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\nYou can send us your reasons via email: habibfemcollective@gmail.com or inbox us on Facebook.

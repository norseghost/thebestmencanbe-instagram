I would be lying if i ever said you served no greater purpose in the book of my life, there is at least one good deed I can attribute to you. It was only after you left me stranded & I found myself still breathing that i knew i could withstand everything that came after you- even the tempest that rattled the hinges on all the doors & blew all the shutters off & split every tree around me in half. She was nothing in comparison to you. -The greatest of all the storms, Amanda Lovelace.

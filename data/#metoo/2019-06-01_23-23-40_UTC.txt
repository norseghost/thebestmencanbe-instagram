It’s always been about controlling women. Instead of fixing our foster care system, prison system, the school to prison pipeline, creating universal healthcare, having a living minimum wage...let’s just preach about being pro-life instead of actually taking action and caring about those who are ACTUALLY LIVING. It’s not about embryos and “the potential of life.” It’s literally about controlling and criminalizing women. 1 in 4 women have an abortion. And oh yeah, criminals can’t vote. 🧠✨

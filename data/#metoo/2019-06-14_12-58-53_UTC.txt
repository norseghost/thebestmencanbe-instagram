How well do you truly know him?
This type thing is not normal at all. We all crave attention and affection and that is why we become blinded by love bombing. Once it stops and the narcissist starts to show his true colors you will search for that high you felt during love bombing for the entire rest of the relationship and you will not get it. Sure here and there when he fucks up or you catch him cheating the love bombing will start again but it gets less and less each time because he knows heâ€™s got you. At this point you feel to special you feel too high to run but you should. Do your research on him!!! #narcissist #narcissisticabuse #lovebombing #mentalhealth #psychology #sociopath #narcissism #narcissistic #narcissists #abuse #recovery #relationships #metoo #love #danger #dating #advice

My first thought was when I went to visit my eldest brother in one of the places he was living at when he \"mutually\" agreed to move out at age 14 #itsnotachoice #gayrights #pride #equalrights #noshame #loveyourself And I remember visiting him, I'm not sure how hold he was at this point, but I remember looking at his closet and seeing all his stuffed animals up on the shelf. He always had them out before. Not necessarily on his bed, but on shelves, his nightstand, etc. Now they lived up in the closet, tucked away like a real Adult. And that's what I understood to be the first real sign of growing up. Putting your stuffies up in the closet, no longer worried they'll feel neglected or unloved... Then I remembered more as I looked at who was staring at me from the closet...#tbt #throwbackthursday #throwback #1990s #creepydolls #creepyassclown #creepyclown #triggerwarning #abuse\nTRIGGER WARNING*\n\nThis is Guy. My great grandmother made him for me when I was born. He's almost 29 years old and has survived well over 30 moves. He's pretty gnarly looking but there's actually a story there. So I thought I'd take this throw back Thursday to talk a little about my childhood. \nIt took me 9 years at least to give this doll a name and that great name ended up being \"Guy\". Real special. But he was, he was my guy. My one guy who never hurt me. The one guy I could trust and hold me. The sexual abuse started young and my dad's indifference started around the same time. There were more abusers than my family knows about. \n#childabuse #abuseawareness #metoo #sexualabuse #sexualassault #itsstillhappening #endabuse #endthestigma #talkaboutit #havetheconversation #depression #mentalillness #did"

We may search the world for gold and riches but true riches can be found only In The Man Christ Jesus. "And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.  The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;  And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone." - Genesis 2:10‭-‬12 KJV

THIS RIVER THAT FLOWED IN EDEN NOW FLOWS FROM INSIDE YOU. THAT IS WHY JESUS SAYS: "He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water." - John 7:38 KJV.

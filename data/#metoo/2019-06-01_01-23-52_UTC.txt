@Regrann from @beautyafterbruises - We know it often gets said "everything happens for a reason”, "thank your enemies because they made you who you are today”, or other similar sentiments, especially those that attribute one’s suffering to the strength they have today. For complex trauma survivors these are either the most infuriating things someone could tell them OR they're ideas that they themselves need to cling to just to help digest that someone could hurt them so terribly. They need to believe it wasn't for nothing. No matter how you personally view the “why” or “the reason” — we want to remind you not to give credit or thanks to those who put you in these situations. They may have created the circumstances where you became strong, resilient and loving, but YOU did the work. YOU did that all by yourself. They did nothing, nothing but harm.
.
YOU gave those gifts to yourself. YOU cultivated the strength. YOU learned empathy, kindness, compassion and love in an environment devoid of most those things. YOU developed your character and the set of standards for which you’d treat others. YOU dug in and learned things about the world and about yourself from the experiences. YOU discovered and exercised bravery - no one taught you how. YOU nurtured yourself when no one else would. YOU decided the kind of person you wanted to be. They didn’t give you any of that. You did it. You taught yourself, build yourself up. You did it alone. You did EVERYTHING.

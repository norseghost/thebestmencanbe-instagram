As people take to the streets to protest against Donald Trump, misogyny and the erosion of women's rights, I actually can't think of a better day to launch my recruitment drive for volunteers to advise on Rights of Women's new legal advice line for women experiencing #sexualharassment at work. 🚫❌
This work is all inspired by the #metoo movement and been made possible by ROSA and the support of @emmawatson 😱💪🏼⚖️ Please share with lawyers you know or tag someone below who would be interested. #linkinbio

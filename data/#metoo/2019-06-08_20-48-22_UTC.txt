Hahahha swipe for my go to makeup look!!! Achieve it by literally just getting stressed about absolutely anything and having a meltdown and not wearing waterproof mascara ðŸ˜‚
Been struggling a lot with nightmares over the last few weeks and theyâ€™ve really been getting me down. Iâ€™ve been feeling like Iâ€™m working so hard to control my feelings when Iâ€™m awake..but Iâ€™m helpless to my subconscious.
From journaling Iâ€™ve managed to turn this around and see the positives. By understanding that although I canâ€™t control my subconscious, with time and therapy the dreams will go and this is just part of the process. As well as realising I am so much more in control of my emotions when Iâ€™m awake compared to a few months ago is such a HUGE step for me. Even if Iâ€™ve had to realise it through difficult situations that I donâ€™t have as much control over Iâ€™m grateful all the sameðŸŒ¿

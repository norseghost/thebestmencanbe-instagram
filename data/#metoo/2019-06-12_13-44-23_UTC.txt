David Clarke at Broadway World wrote a review of FIRE GOES TO DIE that I’m gonna frame and hang on my wall. Thank you for making this girl smile from ear to ear 🌈 .

“Inspired by the #MeToo movement and being a victim of sexual assault herself, Vezilj's empowering anthem touches on those pressing topics. Yet, in the same week as the governor of Alabama signed our nation's most restrictive anti-abortion bill into law, this tune's broader themes about emboldening oneself to take control of one's body couldn't feel more timely.”

It's interesting how much we can criticize the influence of technology - but this morning I got a timely reminder by Google Photos. 
4 years ago we hosted our first Justice Conference, as the new leaders. @vickiereddy and I actually started a year earlier, but we were still living in Australia and making trips to Chicago for 6 months. My first week in the US for leadership meetings - was the week Michael Brown Jr was killed in Ferguson. We've journeyed through the rise of #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo, the global refugee crisis, the 2016 US Presidential election, and the increase in societial division - which was always there, but became more public.

I was genuinely naive coming into this, but I knew it was something that God had called us to - so our job was to turn up, be humble, listen and learn. 
We've learned a lot, and I'm truly grateful for the grace and wisdom of so many great friends who poured into our lives. That opening night 4 years ago @drcornel.west preached! It's a message which has shaped my path these last few years.

The poignancy of this seemingly random reminder - comes at another intersection in our lives. We're about to launch into a new season - which we're very excited about. More to come soon, but it not only continues this calling - it refines it and allows us to step out more boldly in what we believe. Standby.

Thank you to everyone who has taught us, prayed for us, stood with us and shared life with us. We are better for your grace and investment, and we will continue to journey through life with open hands - allowing God to shape the path. "Our job is to turn up, our lives should be framed with hospitality, solidarity and proximity, and our relationships need to be based on mutuality and reciprocity."

She was 60ish.  It was awkward - familiarly uncomfortable.  I had spent a lifetime feeling disconnected from this woman whose eyes were the first ones I gazed into as I entered this world.  And yet still, here I was -  looking for something - anything - motherly.\n\nShe looked away from me.  Gazing out the window she said it.  She finally said something. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a difficult life.\u201d The words just hovered there - and I let them. .\n\nI longed to have the guts to ask - \u201cHow?  What do you mean?

A call back from the heaviness of feeling all alone.  A call back from the nights spent curled up in the corner of my bed - tucked tight under my favorite blanket with the satin edges - cool to the touch...\nTo read more of Beth\u2019s Blog: See link in profile above.\n\n#bethsblog #riseandshine #metoo #whatsyourstory #speakyourtruth #tellyourstory #yourstorymatters #transformativehealing #believeinyourself #sharingiscaring #livelifewell #bethleas"

1 in 4 women is raped every passing moment. 
Only 30% of the rape cases are reported to to the police out of which only 6% ever get justice. 
A woman is getting raped every 2 minutes in the US. 
Only 20% of men rape victims speak out loud.
So tell me now, is this the world you want your children to grow in or are you willing to finally fight for what's right?

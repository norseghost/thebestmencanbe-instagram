Here's an update of my experience with the Samsung technician who discretely took photos of my daughter and I. 
@samsung you will never get another penny out of us. And if anyone ever asks me if I would recommend you again, my answer is STAY FAR AWAY. As far as I'm concerned, Samsung is a pervert sympathizer and cares more about protecting a sexual predator than the client who spent thousands on their appliances. By the way, I was supposed to get a follow up call... still waiting. But I'm not holding my breath! And why did you Ignore my message? Is that what you do to your customers? Did you know on Instagram it lets people know when you've seen their message? Or is this how you operate? You protect a sexual predator over keeping your word to a customer and then ignore them?

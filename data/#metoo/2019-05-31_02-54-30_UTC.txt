What is not spoken about enough in regards to sexual assault:
Stevie (Founder of @_weareher )
"Healing is not spoken about enough. It's so easy to compare ourselves to others and think they're doing great.

Healing is not about the destination; it's about the journey. And with healing comes so many other topics: dealing with effects of trauma like depression or PTSD, how and where to seek medical or legal help, forgiveness, deciding when to date again. 
Experiencing sexual assault can absolutely be life-changing. It could forever change who you are as a person, and that can be very devastating. 
Spreading awareness about all of this helps survivors understand that what they are experiencing is valid. It helps survivors understand they aren't alone. It's so important to talk about every step of the healing journey.

If you are also a survivor @_weareher is a PHENOMENAL organization that helps survivors with their recovery journey❤

THIS WILL ONLY HURT A LITTLE by Busy Philips

I didn't know a lot about Busy Philips before reading her book. I knew her from a few movies and TV shows. 
Clearly I was missing out big time and this book changed everything, and as soon as I finished it I went down a Busy Phillips rabbit hole Whereby I proceed to learn, read and watch everything I can get my hands on about the person I just discovered. 
Her book, I later discovered, offers the same unfiltered and honest stories that her Instagram followers have come to love and appreciate from her.

She shares stories of her childhood, the truth and some of the drama of her dawson Creek’ years, some thoughts on the #metoo movement and the story behind her fairly unknown involvement in ‘Blades of Glory’. This is one story that got my blood boiling - not just because I know many women who have had a similar story to share but also because I was so unaware of it. After reading her comedic memoir there is no doubt that she is a hell of a force of nature. 
I have also come to realise that I love honest memoirs of people I find interesting where you get a glimpse of what it takes to make your dreams come true, the shit most people have to put up with and the willpower it takes to keep going.

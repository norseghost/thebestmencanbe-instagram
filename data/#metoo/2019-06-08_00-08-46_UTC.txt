SourceTalk Saturday: Young Black Female Prey, Pt. 2: The R Kelly Factor

Yes, one of #DaBay area's most SERIOUS natured gatherings is BACK! After a brief hiatus, we return with part two of a topic that is now receiving a tremendous amount of attention by way of the #SurvivingRKelly documentary, the popular #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, and countless accounts of famous Men being accused and convicted. The predatory behavior of Grown Men preying on Young Black Females.
••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
Since the R. Kelly documentary release, and his well publicized sit down interview shortly thereafter, this long overdue conversation has been occurring over and over throughout the city, and nation. It's a MUST we deal with this ordeal NOW, and get to the SOURCE of what is Truly going on, WHY it is happening, and WHAT behaviors and motivating factors are serving as the catalyst to this destructive pattern.
••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
We are calling on the ENTIRE BLACK COMMUNITY, and ALL CONCERNED SOULS to come out to the #SeminoleHeightsLibrary (6/8/19, 6-9p) to assist all of us in getting to the bottom of this, in the name of #Improvement. In order to #Heal properly, we need to be open and Honest. If you cannot attend, or are located outside of the area, this LIVE community discussion show will be streamed WORLDWIDE (where applicable) via #FacebookLive. Food provided by @VeggdOut. Give thanks and hope to see you there.

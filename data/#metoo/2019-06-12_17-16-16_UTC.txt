Well - tomorrow I’ll be in NY! Speaking to the graduating senior class on healthy choices and big leadership as they move into a new life chapter!

It’s been an amazing school year for speaking, and for me, this audience and speech is an awesome way to wrap it all up.

Congratulations to the seniors at Cornwall Central HS! I hope this “final lesson” on your last day is a great one! 🎓

Until September... ! 🎙✨✊🏼

LOOK AT THESE BAD ASS WOMEN!!!! they are collecting trash from on top of a mountain! Over 500 stairs of narrow limestone steps on Lying dragon mountain. They do this every day!  it boggles my mind how our society lacks value for the female body and spirit when women are the ones who care for the world unlike any other. With all that is coming to light on women’s rights, I cannot sit and wait till the next #internationalwomensday to show my appreciation for all the incredible women who’s hard work goes unnoticed. These women are incredible and I am in awe of them. Thank you to all the women who endlessly work hard for their friends, families, the planet and for strangers! Thank you to all of the women who feel under supported, neglected, unappreciated and over worked, I am sending you love and devotion and I couldn’t be more grateful for who you are and your journey towards who you will become.  I am sorry that the world has been so unfair to you and I am sorry that the majority of men ignore your value and beauty, but we’re working on changing that. .

I’m SO proud to introduce IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT! This short film was written, directed AND produced by @jabreewebber. Thank you @jabreewebber for giving me the opportunity to help share this impactful piece of art to the masses. #detroitgirlshustleharder. This film sheds light on #prochoice and #metoo by giving a realistic depiction of what this country will be if we continue to allow states to pass these #antiabortion laws.  Y’all...this country can’t afford to go backwards. Follow the journey and lend your voice to the conversation @ihonfilm.

With states passing anti-abortion laws that contradict women’s rights, #ItHappenedOneNight gives a realistic and shocking view of what the future of America could be as these new state laws pose a severe threat to overturning Roe v. Wade...We can’t afford to go backwards, we MUST move forward.

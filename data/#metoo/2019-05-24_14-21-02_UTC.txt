Enough is enough ❤️ #rotterdam #happyweekend

Mother Nature did it again
Even in the city of Rotterdam
She forced a woman down
Well, with my stubbornness I can’t blame her
It had to be done 
Within an instant I collapsed yesterday 
My period had come
Heavy cramps and nausea 
Making me vomit and do other dirty stuff 
From every opening of my body
Toxic waste and heaviness poured out 
And with every wave I saw people and situations leaving me
No other choice than to say them all goodbye 
Unable to do anything else
I repeated this cycle all through the night 
It’s unbelievable how much shit can be stored in cells 
Before it takes you out 
Right now I feel so empty 
No idea what’s coming up 
So this weekend I take it easy
Time to recover and truly understand Mother Nature’s lesson 
Which at this point I can only describe as:
Enough is enough

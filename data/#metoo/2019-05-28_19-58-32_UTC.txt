Weâ€™re excited to announce that The New York Center for Children won Second Prize in the 2019 Morgan Stanley Strategy Challenge! NYCC is incredibly grateful for the terrific pro bono consulting and analysis that our Morgan Stanley team provided and we're excited to use this plan to treat more children who have suffered from abuse. #MSGivesBack #StrategyChallenge

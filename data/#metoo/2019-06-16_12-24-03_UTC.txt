Happy Father’s Day to all the dad’s out there who have committed to raising their families in peace and love. Happy Father’s Day to all the men who have taken the role of father in the lives of the fatherless. Thank you to all the grandfathers who do the same. 
I wrote a blog post called, POPS: Second Chances, to tell the story of the man I learned true fatherhood from as my own father was my perpetrator. It’s a messy and marvelous story and I hope you read it. Check out the link in my profile. .

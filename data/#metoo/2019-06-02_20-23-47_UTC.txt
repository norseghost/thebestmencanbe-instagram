Stand with Working Women with #KuToo !
It’s a mix of the Japanese word for shoes – Kutsu 靴 and the important #MeToo anti-sexual harassment movement. #KuToo has been appearing more and more in Japanese social media platforms but it doesn’t just apply to people looking for jobs. It’s also the cry of women working already in jobs that require them to wear heels all day.
What do you think about wearing heels all day long ? 👠

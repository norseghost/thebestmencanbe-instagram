I’ve been working to process some trauma more recently and this is a piece I did a few weeks ago so I figured it would be good to post it. Also reminder that there is a poem about my sexual assault on my website at makluzart.com/poetry. It’s the first one. (sorry about the weird cropping—some of the image got cut off. I’ll be posting the full version on my website soon here so keep an eye out.) Please remember that you are not alone. #metoo #art #painting #poetry #acrylic #makluzartandphoto #sexualassault

ðŸ—£Domestic violence and abuse. 
Now I have your attention, a friend has started a movement. It may be small at the moment, but it doesnâ€™t matter. 
Domestic violence and abuse affects us all. We all know someone who has a story, we all know a survivor. ðŸ’ª

These T-shirtâ€™s were an idea to express how we feel and to bring awareness to every day life. 
From sexual, physical, emotional, mental abuse.. to being told what we can and cannot do with our bodies in regards to fertility, pregnancy and the like. 
The T-shirtâ€™s are $17 (plus postage) and are priced at cost. The more orders the cheaper they get, and any profits are given directly to DV Connect, an amazing organisation who so many rely on. 
T-shirtâ€™s are 100% cotton and come in sizes 8-20 (womenâ€™s style) and sizes S-XL (menâ€™s style). To order send an email to bellabookgirl@gmail.com

Letâ€™s get behind this great cause and send a message to the general public that we are NOT ok with this treatment. ðŸ‘•ðŸ‘šðŸ‘•ðŸ‘šðŸ‘•ðŸ‘šðŸ‘•ðŸ‘šðŸ‘•ðŸ‘šðŸ‘•ðŸ‘š #domesticviolence #domesticabuse #domesticabusesurvivor #domesticabuseawareness #domesticviolenceawareness #domesticviolencesurvivor #metoo #respectwomen #respectmen #saynotoviolence #violenceagainstwomen #mybodymychoice #mybodynotyours

Why isn’t class defined as a protected characteristic? Could this be why unconscious bias towards working class employees remains? And perhaps why tackling social inequality and encouraging social mobility continues to be a lower-level priority on the workplace agenda?⠀
⠀
However, as Human Resources Expert Regina Hartley brilliantly conveys in her Ted Talk Why the best hire may not have the perfect resume, those who have fought to achieve the same level of experience, knowledge and qualification as their more privileged peers deserve as many opportunities in the workplace. This potential talent pool certainly should not be overlooked. Indeed, in describing some of the world’s most successful business leaders, Hartley explains:⠀
⠀
“They don’t think they are who they are in spite of adversity, they know they are who they are because of adversity. They embrace their trauma and hardships as key elements of who they’ve become, and know that without those experiences, they might not have developed the muscle and grit required to become successful”.⠀

As HR professionals and employers, we can do our bit for social inclusion – starting with your D&I strategy.⠀

From the recruitment process – the writing of job descriptions and person specifications, the application selection process and interviews – to opportunities for training, promotion and rewards for achievement, as well as cultivating your workplace culture – attitudes towards employee worth and values of contribution – class needs to be considered.

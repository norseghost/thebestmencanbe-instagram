** Trigger Warning - Sexual Assault**
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I woke up today, two years ago (the week this picture was taken) with 13 bruises on my body.  13 bruises on my body which proved that last night wasn't just a nightmare, that I FOUGHT, that I was now a statistic. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It's been two years, to the date, and I still struggle with today.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I struggle putting into words just how much one day could affect my life - my relationships, my mental health, how I view myself.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
My story is full of moments like this one, things I never thought I'd recover from.  But day by day He is faithful.  Day by day He has rebuilt me, held me, and showered me in His promises.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
YOU ARE MORE THAN WHAT’S BEEN DONE TO YOU. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Your story isn’t over yet.

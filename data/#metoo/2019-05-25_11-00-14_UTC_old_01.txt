Another woman’s death, witches. Almost certainly murder, tho not confirmed. And we barely know what to write, because it keeps happening, and we KEEP DYING. .

Of today’s unendurable tragedy, though, one recurring issue is that we’re desperate to educate the the media and authorities to STOP FUCKING VICTIM BLAMING or, at least, STOP FUCKING REPORTING IT. Today, a guy said this:
“North Park Tennis Club head coach said more lighting was needed in the area. ‘It is fairly dark in the morning. When I open up here [at the tennis courts] it's pitch black’ he said.”

So AGAIN, a woman’s murder is blamed on LIGHTS. We’ve a man (who he is doesn’t matter; it’s not about him) who has NFI he’s VICTIM BLAMING. And who has NFI this DIRECTLY LEADS TO MURDER, BECAUSE PERPS SEE THAT WOMEN WALKING IN THE DARK ARE FAIR GAME. .

Most painful of all is that A JOURNALIST SAW FIT TO PUBLISH HIS WORDS. We don’t CARE if it’s relevant: THEY EDIT WHEN SUICIDE IS INVOLVED, WHY NOT WHEN IT’S *JUST* A WOMAN’S KILLING? FUUUUCK. .

Rape culture, witches. RAPE. FUCKING. CULTURE. When will they learn calling for more lights doesn’t stop the violence, IT ONLY STOPS IT WHERE THE LIGHTS ARE. If you call for more lights, YOU’RE TELLING WOMEN THEY’RE ONLY WELCOME WHERE THERE ARE FUCKING LIGHTS. And if you tell women to only walk near lights, you’re not saving A SINGLE WOMAN: because you’re telling perps to KILL THE ONES WALKING IN THE DARK. .

How does that help a woman whose CAR BREAKS DOWN AT NIGHT? Who has to park in a DARK CAR PARK? Who CAN’T FIND A TAXI? Who HAD TO WORK OVERTIME AND IT GOT DARK? Who was murdered by a partner WHO DELIBERATELY CHOSE THE DARK PLACE TO DO IT. THEY’RE ALL **BAD** WOMEN WHO DESERVE TO FUCKING DIE? WHY NOT JUST KILL US ALL NOW AND SAVE SOME FUCKING TIME? .
.
We’re fucking DONE with this. DONE. TIRED OF EXPLAINING IT, AND FULL OF SADNESS. And still, IT NEVER FUCKING ENDS. 
Sorry for the shouting, witches. We’re done. And SO FUCKING TIRED of explaining. What the FUCK will it take? .

Taking in this day... it was big. I made a grounded thoughtful choice to share my personal story, and how surf therapy saved my life. Speaking candidly to break the silence for my personal healing and to give voice for others navigating life with the impact of trauma.. for a segment on the Today Show! Never could have predicted this. Itâ€™s been a long arduous road... and now I rise. #surftherapy #vitaminsea #motherocean #ptsd #delayedonsetptsd #cptsd #surf4life #surfing #surfsisters #ohana #brave #authentic #nothingtoprove #metoo @groundswellcommunityproject @todayshow

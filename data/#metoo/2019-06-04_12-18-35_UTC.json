                        "text": "Did you know that 87-93% of disease comes from our THOUGHTS\n.\n*Thoughts* become emotions, emotions become attitude. Our attitude is our reaction, and all of our daily reactions make up our *lifestyle.*\n.\nIt all boils down to two kinds of emotions. Love-based (positive) emotions, and fear-based (negative) emotions.\n.\nLove-based emotions include: love, joy, faith, trust, inner strength, confidence, belief,happiness, caring, sharing, forgiveness, openness, passion, freedom, harmony, honesty, beauty, compassion, self-love, self-appreciation, respect, acceptance, and peace.\n.\nFear-based emotions include: fear, anger, disgust, worry, anxiety, frustration, resentment, ill-will, blame, sadness, jealousy, negativity, and stress.\n.\nDr. Bradley Nelson from \"The Emotion Code\" said \"A trapped emotion is literally a ball of energy, and these will lodge anywhere in the body and disrupt the normal energy field of the body.\"\n.\nSounds crazy, but it makes sense! Our emotions are stored in different parts of our body.\n.\nAnger is stored in the Liver & Gallbladder.\nWorry is stored in the Stomach.\n.\nGrief is stored in the Lungs (ever experienced grief that felt like it took all the breath out of your lungs?)\n.\nFear is stored in the Kidneys.\n.\nStress is stored in the Heart.\n.\nI especially relate to worry, fear, and stress.\n.\nThere are so many essential oil's that I use for myself emotionally. Lavender I use on the daily but there are others I use when life gets real, such as White Angelica\n\nUsed for:\n\u2728emotional balance \u2728protection + security\n\nWhite Angelica essential oil is comforting, strengthening, grounding, balancing, and stabilising. Use this oil to help seal and support your aura, and reserve emotional energy.\n.\n\u2728How to use:\n* Apply to shoulders, ears, throat, spine, wrists, neck, abdomen, or feet to promote emotional wellbeing and balance.\n* Diffuse to create a comforting and grounding atmosphere.\n* Add to bath water to help relax the body and mind.\n* Use White Angelica when seeking power, protection, and strength."

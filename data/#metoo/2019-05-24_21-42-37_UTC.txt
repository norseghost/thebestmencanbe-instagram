So the video from the 80s is bad. It was a different time - a time when one of the most popular British television shows of all time had a character refer to the local shop as a “paki shop” - but yeah, it makes tough viewing. You do wonder though, in 30 years’ time will we be pillorying people for once driving petrol cars? So hard to judge a less informed era with a modern rule book.

And then anyone who has followed @tonyrobbins knows that he dishes out tough love at his seminars, pushes people’s buttons to change their state, can sound aggressive. It’s sad that some shitty digital tabloid has thrown a #metoo angle at this because it is SUCH an important movement and making a movement about rape and sexual assault look like a movement against people trying to pick up women in the pretty distant past is so damaging.

Tony’s video about raising standards and turning shoulds into musts is the foundation stone on which my abstinence is based and, although it’s too complicated to explain, he’s also the reason I volunteer at my local youth group, which has been a fantastic addition to my life for the past 3 years.

Trump winning the presidency, the Leave campaign achieving Brexit, the passing of laws against a woman’s right to choose - the world can be a shitty place. The last thing we need is a witch hunt against one of the truly great people. #truthispower

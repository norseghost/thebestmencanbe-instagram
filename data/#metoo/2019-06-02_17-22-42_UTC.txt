If we scorn the tears of the rape survivor, because the survivor is gay, we scorn the heart of Christ. If we turn our backs and close our eyes to discrimination and persecution, we close the doors of our hearts to Christ. If we mock the victim of violence and harassment because the victim is Trans, we are no better than the soldiers who crowned Christ with thorns. #sundaymeditation #chooselove #monthofthesacredheart #pridemonth #metoo #timesup #churchtoo #christendomtoo #christendomcollege

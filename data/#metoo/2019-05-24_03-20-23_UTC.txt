I’m proud of myself. I walked into North Forney for the first time since I stopped going to the GED classes. I told myself at the start of the new year that I would get myself to a place where I could go up there again with 2 younger family members who seem to look up to me starting there in the fall. There is some regret I couldn’t go up there earlier. I was more hyper vigilant than I typically am but I survived. Being in a room that both brings me joy from performing in Annie Jr. 5 years ago plus from being in Choir and anxiety from the fact that it was a place where I first assaulted was pretty hard. Godspell itself did not inspire me in the traditional sense and even slightly annoyed me with a mention of heathens(which if I remember refers to basically any non Christian). It was a step in my recovery and honestly brought up fun memories of the last Christian church I was in. (I’m probably going to make a point soon about graduation. Well. Probably 2)

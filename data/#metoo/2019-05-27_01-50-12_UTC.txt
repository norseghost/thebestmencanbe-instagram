If we are feeding our bodies chemicals and toxins, disease and bacteria will grow inside of us. However, if we nourish our bodies with organic fruits, vegetables, and grass-fed and finished meats, life abounds.⠀
⠀
As I researched the correlation between food and cancer, I immediately decided to revamp my diet.  I eliminated all sugar (including honey and maple syrup), caffeine, grains, gluten, alcohol, and most dairy products.⠀
⠀
The dairy that I did eat was very limited and was only organic, raw dairy per the Budwig protocol.  My diet primarily consisted of fresh vegetable juice, veggies, healthy fats, and some lean proteins like some turkey and wild-caught fish. I alternated between two juices every day. ⠀
⠀
My first juice was eight ounces total of red cabbage, kale, romaine lettuce, green bell pepper, Swiss chard, celery, and lemon.  The second juice was eight ounces of ¼ green apple and carrots. ⠀
⠀
I alternated between the two for a total of thirteen times a day. I was also advised to eat a cup of fresh okra every day because of its powerful cancer-fighter properties and high antioxidant levels. I also had 4 slices of red beets, three times a week while incorporating the Budwig Protocol.⠀
⠀
The first step in nourishing your body is to flood it with micronutrients.  Micronutrients are going to be vitamins and minerals that can only be found in living foods.⠀

I’m detailing more of this in my new book, “How I Beat Cancer in 90 Days.” Right now the only place until August that  you can purchase the printed copy is at:

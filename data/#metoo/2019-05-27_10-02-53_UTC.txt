Part 1 (English Follows Japanese)
オシャレをしてミニスカートを履いた日に、それは起こった。二年前、留学に行く友達の送別ディナーからの帰り道に、男の人に後をつけられた。彼は私に話しかけ、道を聞いたりした。しかし、私の学校がどこなのか聞かれたとき、とても怖くなった。私は近くのコンビニに逃げ込んで母親に電話をした。どうすればいいかわからなかった—母は地球の反対側に住んでいたし、かといって私の近くに住んでいる祖母を呼んで、彼女を危険にさらしたくなかった。「レイプされたらどうしよう？連れていかれて、痛めつけられたら？」という考えが頭から離れなかった。静かな裏道を通って家に帰っているとき、その男の人がまだついてきているのが見えた。いつもと違う方向から家に走って帰って、鍵を閉めた。その間ずっと母に電話で、無事を知らせていた。今はもう大丈夫だけれど、あの後しばらくはスカートを履くのが怖かった。

It happened on the one day I decided to be cute and wear a short skirt. Two years ago on my way home from a farewell dinner with my friends going on exchange, I was followed home by a man. He started talking to me, asking me for directions. But then he asked me what school I go to and I got really scared. I ran away from him towards the closest combini and started to call my mom. I didn't know what to do — my mom lived halfway across the world so she couldn't help me, but if I called my grandma that lives here, maybe he could hurt her. These thoughts started running through my head: “What if he’s going to rape me? Take me away and hurt me?”. When I took a quiet backstreet to my house, I could still see him following me. I ran home from a different direction and locked the door. This whole time I was on the phone with my mom, reassuring her that I was safe. I’m okay now, but for a while I definitely had a fear of wearing skirts. -Anonymous 📸: @tobeprecise 📝: @mishadesu

I Admire Great Women.
Hypathia is one, in case you haven't heard of her you should. To achieve under the great sexism of the time was courageous. Of course it eventually cost her her life. There is a 2009 movie about her called "Agora". But there is so much more to her story. Absolutely fascinating.

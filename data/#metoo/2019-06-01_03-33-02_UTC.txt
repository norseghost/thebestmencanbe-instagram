It's been six years already!!!! I'm celebrating an anniversary of breaking my silence.  It was THE hardest thing ever, but such a huge relief.  Six years ago, I embraced adversity and ran with it. I never knew life would take me on this path, but, I'm glad it did. I thought I was going to be a news reporter but God saw fit to have me in another area. Accepting that I was molested took alot of courage and can talk about it so easily now. God has helped me along this journey and I've had a great support team over the past six years. Looking over some of the things I wrote in 2013 just blows my mind. Last night I read a line that said, "Feels like I'm not alive." 😥 But look at me now!!! I AM ALIVE, AND IM FREE!! So when you see me living,  just know that I have so much to live for and so much to do! My adversity allowed me to give birth to my five year old baby, One Touch Transformation!! God is so good! 🙌🏼 ok, I'm finished, for now 😁

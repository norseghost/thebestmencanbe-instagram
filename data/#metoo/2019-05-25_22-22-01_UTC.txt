@ellefanning , though!! I remember @festivaldecannes as being a place where actresses came to show their “artistic” side by smoking, wearing lots of black leather, not smiling for pics, not shaving their ‘pits, and trying très hard to be #trèssexy.

This year had such an air of triumph, magic, and innocence to it. I like to think that the #metoo movement has lifted a suffocating weight off of women in entertainment and is manifesting in #fashion as what I’m now calling The New Exuberance! #thenewexuberance !

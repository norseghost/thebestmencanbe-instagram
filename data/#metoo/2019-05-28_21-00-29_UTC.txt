Tbh I didn’t even know heightism was a thing until  one of my friends told me about it and tbh I see this happening so much in the media. Like, Kevin Hart and his wife and him being shorter than her. Like people are literally scrutinized for being too short if they’re a male, and too tall if they’re a female.

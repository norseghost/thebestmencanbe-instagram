This is what an abused woman looks like. This video was filmed while I was in the abusive situation. In fact, the person who abused me was sitting behind the person filming. I was about 20 years old. My photography career was starting to do well. I was shooting for magazines, flying to different cities, and photographing celebrities. This is how people saw me. Smiling and working away. No one knew I was being abused. How could they know? Due to grooming even I was unaware. I had no idea what psychological abuse was and never imagined that abuse could be “invisible”.⁣⁣⁣

If I asked you to describe how someone who’s being abused looks or acts, is this what would come to mind? Something life has shown me over and over again is that we never really know what people are going through behind closed doors, even those with whom we may interact on a regular basis.⁣⁣⁣

If approximately 51% of Canadian women have experienced physical or sexual violence, that means it’s all around us, whether we are conscious of it or not. It can be overwhelming to take that in, to get an idea of just how much pain and injustice is occurring, constantly. But just as we may not know the depths of any given person’s suffering, we also do not know the impact our simple acts of kindness can make. ⁣⁣

When being abused brought me to a place of isolation and hopelessness, it was random acts of kindness shown to me by strangers that restored my faith in humanity and changed my life. I’ll share those stories soon, but in the meantime I hope you keep this in mind as you go about your day. We don’t know the impact our actions might have on people so if the opportunity to be kind presents itself to you today, choose it. It may make more of a difference in someone’s life than you will ever even know, and that’s a beautiful thing.⁣⁣⁣

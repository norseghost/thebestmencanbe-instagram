Lifting has and probably will always be my best therapy. It helped me through some of the hardest times in my life. Three years ago, after I had my own #metoo story, the gym was the only place I felt safe and strong. After a hard day, I usually can’t wait to get my hands on a barbell. Two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds. Put a barbell in front of me and suddenly my only problem is if I can lift it. Nothing compares to how powerful I feel with a barbell in my hands. This photo means a lot to me. I can see my mother, father (of course he’s standing...he’s even more competitive than me) and brother in the background. All three have been huge role models in their own way to me, and I was so happy to have them there on my competition day ❤️🏋🏻‍♀️

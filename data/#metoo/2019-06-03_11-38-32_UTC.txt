Consent is not a transaction (A drink does not mean you get sex in return). It must be freely given without bribery or coercion. Buying someone a drink does not mean they ‘owe you’ anything. When buying someone a drink never expect more than a ‘thank you’. #consent #metoomovement #metoo #thegeminiproject #timesup #endthesilence #endrapeculture #thisisnotconsent #consentculture

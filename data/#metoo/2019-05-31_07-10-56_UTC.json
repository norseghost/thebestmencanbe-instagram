Not having a topic meant, you just never knew what would be the discussed but we had a great time. \nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do the discussions justice but some points from last night.\n\n1)Dating: we talked a lot about dating, how we need something different with minimal effort and stress to fit into our busy lives but also how what we are looking for at 40 is not what we were looking for at 20.  There was an interesting debate about where you find truly single men! And also where is the right forum to use as they may not be active on social media. \n2) Wealth: so many other communities, Jewish, Indian etc set up family owned and run businesses, creating wealth for the next generation, while in the black communities we seem to have been brought up to get an education and then go get that \u201cOffice job\u201d by yourself.  How do we change that for future generations? \nInteresting comment that even though we know that going to university does not necessarily strongly correlate with wealth creation, we would still expect our kids to go. \n3) Justice: This was about the injustice of Sentences for offences for people of colour.  I.e. Harvey Weinstein not going to prison but paying compensation to his victims, while Bill Cosby was jailed.  There was also a discussion those black people who are successful and how they chose to support or be vocal about certain movements like #MeToo but stay quiet on #Blacklivesmatter  This links to the 2nd point about supporting our own communities.\n\nWe need more MEN to get involved in the conversations and bring other points of view!!!!! #DiveIn #diveintalks #comedivein #blackdating #blackwealth #blackjustice"

Nature, Walking and Pok√©mon go are just some of my new grounding techniques. #healingvibes #shepersisted #ptsdawareness #notalone #metoo #ptsd #ptsdrecovery #ptsdsurvivor #ptsdsucks #anxiety #anxietysupport #depression #narcissist #narcissisticabuse #domesticviolence #domesticviolenceawareness #recovery #realrecovery #selfcare #selflove #itgetsbetter #stepforward #stronger #therapy #mentalhealth #mentalillness #mentalhealthawareness #naturephotography #nature

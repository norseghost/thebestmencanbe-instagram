*TRIGGER WARNING*
.

.
So I've never fully spoken up about the sexual abuse, or any abuse, that I've been through. I finally decided to report the last...incident after 3 months because I see him a lot everywhere and it drives me nuts and I can't live like this. I hope this all goes well and he goes away and he learns his lesson and I get justice and peace. I joke this helps with my courage so I can stand up for myself and against the other people who raped me so they can do their time and lose opportunities to continue bothering me and/or hurt other women. I'm finally getting therapy and I'm finally going to be fully and completely vocal about these things. I can say "I was raped" but actually saying and describing what happened...that wrecks me all over again, but I'll never get better and it'll never get easier until I take a stand and I start talking. I want it to be out there and as out there as I can stand because I want women who aren't as aggressive or assertive to see that they can stand up for themselves and it's never too late to speak and no matter how it happened your story is valid and you deserve justice. I'm excited for healing and justice. I can't wait to be free

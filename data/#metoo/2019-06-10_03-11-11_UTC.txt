#magicallife as I followed the flow out here in my visit to #norcal.  The sat morning #ecstaticdance #santacruz with my friend Daniel Mollner and community had me buzzing even more.  Then I ran into a friend at #newleafmarkets - a friend who we had decided it just wouldn‚Äôt work out to see Sat.  Guess the universe had other planz!

Then at the beach this lost pup sea lion comes ashore.  I used body language to give him some company, reassurance and support as we waited together for the Parks people to come.  Mirroring his body language (I named him Oscar), the young pup got within about 5 feet of me.  When I made a slight reach to him he got scared and backed away quickly.  I just continued to be calm and offer my presence for him. 
Unfortunately the park ranger was more fearful of him and said that she thot he looked fine. I felt he was injured and separated from his mom- but she didn‚Äôt seem to hear and have authority to do more than leave him there ü•¥. In the end, it was another practice in #lettinggo as I sent him love and hope his mama would find him. 
Still so freakin‚Äô magical to hold an energy of ‚Äúi am safe‚Äù and know how to use #bodylanguage in order to connect to a wild creature.  The eye contact with Oscar was amazing, breath-taking!

If you’re going to tell a company or celebrity or athlete to “Stay Out of Politics”, then you’re probably also someone who feels that your 1st Amendment rights have been violated after being told to shut the fuck up because you’re being an asshole. By the way, if you’re telling that company to shut up, you probably should too. And another thing, no one cares that you aren’t giving them your service because they are a multimillion dollar company that doesn’t want your homophobic service anyway. Kudos to @axe for actually trying to support the gay community, not just slapping rainbows on everything. —————————————————————————— —————————————————————————— #feminist #abortion #prolife #prochoice #feminism #womensrights #gop #republican #birthcontrol #contraceptive #condom #politics #guns #guncontrol #immigrants #refugees #murder #liberal #conservative #racisminamerica #whiteprivilege #democrat #socialism #capitalism #metoo #rapevictim #rapeculture #gunviolence #fucktrump #impeachtrump

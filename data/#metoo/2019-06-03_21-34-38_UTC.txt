Help me join @doctorlaurel in supporting the conversation around what #consent looks like. Consent is about asking before you start and stopping when you are told to stop. Consent isn’t exclusive to sexual activity. And while consent culture doesn’t apply to just women, stats show 90% of rape victims are women. This both says we need to encourage men to feel comfortable to share their stories as well as educate them on what consent looks like from a woman’s point of view. |

Whether you purchase a shirt from @spiritualhoneys (proceeds go to @thejhf to end the backlog of untested rape kits in the US), open up a discussion amongst your community about why consent is so important to you, or post/like/share #consentculture content yourself, all of these actions collectively help us overcome our barriers to safe and healthy relationships. |

When will we stop being embarrassed to ask if what we’re doing is okay? When will open dialogue and communication be not only accepted, but required. When will we learn to respect another human’s boundaries? When will we accept that someone can change their mind and that is okay and should be respected? |

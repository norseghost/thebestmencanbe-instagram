Need I say more? I think I need:

How do we feel about these abortion bans fam? How do we feel about being told our #metoo is a joke? How do we feel about prisoners being given lupron AS A PUNISHMENT when we’re told it’s a “cure”? How do we feel about all the doctors who said it was all in our heads? How do we feel about the wage gap? How do we feel about being told to sit down because we look too young?
HOW DO WE FEEL AS WOMEN?!

I’ll tell you - I don’t feel good about it. And it’s even WORSE for women of color. It just breaks my heart.

It’s unfortunate that in times like these we HAVE to write our senators, representatives, and congress. Because if we don’t, behaviors like the ones listed above are just going to continue.

I used to ask ‘what can I even do for something like this?’ - WRITE A LETTER!!
Then I used to say ‘A letter takes forever to write’ - well fortunately (unfortunately) there are A LOT of examples out there we can use as templates. So use that google device you have in your hand right now and look one up! We HAVE to speak up and be loud because if we aren’t, our BASIC HUMAN rights will slowly dwindle away.

There’s so much I have to say. I understand that there are still clinics open, I understand things have been put in place. BUT SOMETHING IS STARTING.
They say a picture can say 1000 words so there you have it.
SCREW YOU AND YOUR OPINIONS OF *MY* UTERUS!

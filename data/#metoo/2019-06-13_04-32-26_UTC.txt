Sometimes things just hurt. You might feel broken, you might feel lost, you might get stuck in a memory of the past that keeps pulling you back in and twisting you up.  It's okay to not be okay sometimes. I can tell you you don't have to continue to live that way. 
You have the power to change and to be different. To have a different outcome in your life when you decide that you're going to do it.

💬 New Blog Post Alert 💬 ⁣
⁣
Have you read my new blog post yet? Click the link in my bio to read why the UK Government is now banning NDAs & their illicit uses. ⁣
⁣
Too many victims of abuse, misconduct & discrimination are being silenced by their employers with the use of NDAs. ⁣
⁣
Employers shouldn't be able to cover up their crimes with a simple document, it strips the employee of all of their rights and can cause serious psychological & physiological distress. ⁣
⁣
The time is now for companies to be held accountable for the wrongful acts carried out by their employees. In my opinion, forcing an employee to sign an NDA where abuse, misconduct or discrimination is concerned, is a clear admission of guilt. ⁣

What are your thoughts on the use of NDAs? Let me know below 👇🏼 ⁣

Brain wonâ€™t shut off.  Tomorrowâ€™s ruling is rattling around in my head and even the Valium isnâ€™t helping ðŸ¤¬
Insomnia has been the worst part of the PTSD and depression for me because it has so many adverse side affects.  Yes Iâ€™ve tried it all. Meditation, exercise, music, sleeping pills, apps.... even drinking until I can just pass out.  But sometimes none of it works.  Just gotta remind myself itâ€™s temporary ... it will pass. Until then... fuck them, fuck the system and fuck the process.  Womenâ€™s rights are human rights, assholes. .

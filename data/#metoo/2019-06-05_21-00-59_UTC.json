Ok, listen, I \nhate this too and I don't \nwant to end up totally hating \nthis poem, so PIVOT \nto my apartment \nand my life both can be quite \na mess, not just because \nI remain the anointed \nguardian of the dirt and \nshame, but no, of course \nyou didn't ruin \neverything! but I degress \nfrom my intended digression: \nyour house and your cars and \nthat replica of a bookshelf that \nsomehow manages \nto make real books look like \nplastic replicas nifty! Here, \nmy dusty books, the \ncastles of cobwebs the \nold poems and ancient electric bills \nall in one silly absurd \nmess. Better, \nyour central vacuuming house and \nagain, is that really \na bookshelf with real \nbooks just TRYING TO \nlook \nplastic? PIVOT: s'pose \nyou pose sez the camera, going \nto catch that all \nmay be-been \nthere but didn't maybe really \ndo that!?central vacuous smile, \nsmile! then just got to clear up \na bunch of \npesky old parking tickets \none of these \ndays, so there, all\nis fair. /mr\n#poetrynetworks\n#poetryofinstagram #poetrycosmos #poetrycommunity #beatpoetry #beatpoets #spilledink  #metoo #siblings #shame #poemsofinstagram #poetryporn #kittiesofinstagram"

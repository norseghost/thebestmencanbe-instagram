ðŸ—£Justice for Lai Dai Han seeks to raise awareness of allegations of widespread sexual violence by South Korean soldiers against Vietnamese women during the Vietnam War. JLDH enables political and community leaders to connect with the victims of sexual violence to understand their suffering first hand, and is creating public art "Mother and Child" as a permanent reminder of the plight of the Lai Dai Han.

Next month, we will be unveiling the commemorative sculpture, made by artist @rebeccahawkinssculpture . ðŸ”ŽLook out for updates on our socials over the next couple of weeks!

The Daily Beast posted a review of the interview, which details how West opened up about his fear as a man during the #MeToo movement and why he thinks liberals \u201cbully\u201d Trump supporters \u201clike [him].\u201d\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nThe hour-long conversation consisted of many topics surrounding the often controversial artist, including his mother, his old beef with Drake, battling bipolar disorder and life as an influential being. But one of the most noteworthy moments of the interview was West defending his support of #DonaldTrump. \u201cThis is like my thing with Trump\u2014we don\u2019t have to feel the same way, but we have the right to feel what we feel.\u201d When he wears his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, he says it\u2019s \u201cnot about politics,\u201d West explains. He went on to say his reason for wearing the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is not because of politics but instead to break down the stigma around supporting Trump. West also says he didn\u2019t vote for Trump, nor has he ever voted. \u201cThen you don\u2019t have a say in this,\u201d Letterman replied.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nAt one point, West ignores a point Letterman makes about it being problematic to support an individual who directly harms various groups of people with their words and actions. Instead of acknowledging, West says he cares about Trump voters who are \u201ctreated like enemies of America because that\u2019s what they felt.\u201d \u201cHave you ever been beat up in your high school for wearing the wrong hat?\u201d he asks eventually. When asked who is doing the majority of bullying in America right now, West says, \u201cLiberals bully people who are Trump supporters!\u201d....\u2026to read the rest log on to BallerAlert.com (clickable link on profile)"

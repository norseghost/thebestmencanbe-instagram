In the week that Harvey Weinstein got a provisional settlement of $44 million with victims of his sexual misconduct, in Amsterdam, the shooting of Clinch came to an end. In this post-#MeToo film, the focus is on life after sexual violence. The filmmaker is eyeing the international film festival circuit.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

“A lot of films focus on the attack itself,” says Cíntia Taylor, writer and director of Clinch. “We wanted to tell a sorry about the overcoming of sexual violence. How do you move on after rape?”⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Clinch is a 15-minute-film about a professional violin player who wants to take revenge on the man who attacked her. During her training in a boxing school, she realizes that it’s not about a physical pay-off. She must learn to accept that that incident is never going away and that it is now part of her life story.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

Taylor particularly wanted Clinch to be an alternative to the image of women that is still too common in films. “Women in pain are seen as witches, irrational beings. While in fact, they’re living in a bubble of pain. The main character of Gone Girl is portrayed as a lunatic. But also Glen Close in Fatal Attraction is a maniac who is out to destroy a man’s life.”⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

The film is currently in post-production and the premiere is planned for Autumn. “We received funding from the Amsterdam Fonds voor de Kunst to send the film to international festivals. We would like to bring local centres supporting victims of sexual violence in contact with festivals where the film will be shown. The most important thing is to promote conversations around this topic.” .

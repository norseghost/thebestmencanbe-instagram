So excited to be giving an author talk at @pottershousedc 
If you live in the area, or will be visiting the area on July 16, 2019 please stop in to hear me read excerpts from my book as I discuss women's rights in the age of #metoo and share my own experiences with the justice system during my sexual assault case.

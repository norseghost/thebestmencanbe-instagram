                        "text": "Follow @curmudgeonreviews for my book reviews...\n\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\nTHE POWER by Naomi Alderman (fiction)\n-\n-\nReview: I think the Me Too movement is definitively net positive. I also think that a lot of the most vocal supporters of the movement have made so many mistakes, alienating potential male allies, hurting real and future victims, and disempowering women by stripping them of agency. But what I often come to back to is men\u2019s inability to envision an existence in which you are nearly always physically weaker than the opposite sex. This feels especially glaring in the early stages of dating, when you don\u2019t even really know the other person. That has to significantly impact your worldview and behavior, and because most men would never knowingly exploit this physical advantage, they just don\u2019t think about it. This book reverses that power dynamic. And thank god I knew that in advance, because the cover says, \u201cA fierce new power has emerged\u2014and only women have it.\u201d (Yaaassssss!!!) If I\u2019d seen that first, I\u2019d have never picked this up. So, women tap into a dormant electrostatic power, akin to that of an electric eel, that they\u2019d somehow lost over the centuries, and the world turns upside down. I was really curious to see how this would go, and it started out promising. But I just didn\u2019t care about the characters at all. And for every two flashes of brilliant writing, there was a clunky thud that took me out of it. Great idea, disappointing execution. It goes from interesting sociological thought experiment to glorified vampire movie...which will be good for Alderman when they inevitably adapt this into a movie. Just wasn\u2019t what I was hoping for.\n-\n-\nRating: 3.5/5\n-\n-\n#thepower #bookreview #books #reading #women #yougogirl #yasss #femaleempowerment #metoo #thecurmudgeonreviews #curmudgeonreviews #thecurmudgeon #curmudgeon #repost"

We Are the Evidence educates, validates and empowers people who have been sexually assaulted. Our mission is to shed light on the truth about sexual assault, destroy society’s myths and the stigma associated with being a victim of this violent crime and make lasting changes in the justice system. 
To achieve our mission, we’re creating a safe community where you can learn about your options moving forward and make an educated decision about whether or not you will report the crime and testify. It’s also a community where you can share your stories and regain your power by using this dark, traumatic event to empower yourself and others to influence change. 
Together, we can educate people about sexual assault; teach friends, family, and co-workers how to be supportive, and dispel the myths and half-truths that lead jurors to deliver not-guilty verdicts. Sexual assault is not only a crime against individuals—it’s a crime against humanity that hurts all of us.

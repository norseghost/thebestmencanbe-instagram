We have been saved and been victorious. I am not any better person from those who follow me, for those who live on this earth, I humble myself to know that no matter how good things go in my life when the bad occurs I cant dwell in it but know I'm being forged to be better. Yet I have to chose that within myself, God our father knows how great we can be. The battles we face each day is a choice for all of us. We all try to help others but forget to ask help for ourself no matter how much growth you gained. I pray for all those who follow me and those who dont souly because we are a church and even tho you have no faith I have faith in you as our father does, God has always has had his faith in you! #armorofgod #armorofgod_counsel #willofgod #dailydevotion #faithfullness #fruitofthespirit #earthenvessels #believer #IIcorinthians #nkjv #focus #face #help #metoo #pray #church #gains #forged #choice #growth #follow #strength #god #father #trust #deal #holyspirit

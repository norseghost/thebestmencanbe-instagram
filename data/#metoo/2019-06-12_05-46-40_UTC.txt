Rainbows, Unicorns and sprinkles. Had a play in the kitchen today, rainbow cupcakes with strawberry kiwi icing, rainbow jellys, and chocolates. Every so often I'll test out something new. Doing stuff for others always makes me happy, and I get to use my daughter's schools staffroom as my guniea pigs 😂😂😂

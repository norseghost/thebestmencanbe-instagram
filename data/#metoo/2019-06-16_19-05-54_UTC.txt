Meet @_ashley.simpson ðŸ’™ðŸ’œ Sheâ€™s doing a #SurvivorTakeover on our account tomorrow 6/17.

Ashley and I connected at the beginning of the year. Since meeting her, Iâ€™ve been so inspired by her willingness to help others and bringing awareness to what itâ€™s like growing up as a childhood sexual abuse survivor.

She often blogs about mental health and healing. I saw her post about PTSD the other week and knew she needed to do a takeover for us. She has so many good things to say and I know youâ€™ll all be touched by her kindness and strength.

Please join me in welcoming Ashley!

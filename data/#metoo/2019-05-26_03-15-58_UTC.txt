The Love Necklace is so much more than a sweet accessory. This is an artisan crafted piece of fine art. It is a sculpture. It is the statement that the woman who wears it stands against abuse, and stands beside her sisters, supporting those who are on journeys back in into places of love and light. This necklace is a statement that community matters... that support matters... and that showing someone that they are cared for can make all the difference.

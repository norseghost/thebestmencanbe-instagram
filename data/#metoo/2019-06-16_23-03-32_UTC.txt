Look what I found! These are the people that robbed me on an advertising deal, as well... I paid these people to advertise my February Black History Event and Black History themed clothing line, and another company of mine, and they failed to do so in their "Go Urban Las Vegas" Magazine Publication. See something say something. You can only do wrong so long before someone says something out loud. This is Blacks hindering Black business. What is done in the dark will come to light. #metoo #dadbusiness #craftydevils #blackchamberofcommercelasvegas

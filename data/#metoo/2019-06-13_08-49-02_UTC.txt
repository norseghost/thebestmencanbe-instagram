Does two "photoshopped" women and 15 men mean you are reflecting wider society? ⠀
I should say these women did attend they just weren't in the original picture.⠀
⠀
"The photo, posted to Instagram by Italian fashion designer Brunello Cucinelli and taken at his home in Solomeo, Italy, shows a group of entrepreneurs including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, and Dropbox co-founder and CEO Drew Houston."⠀
⠀
"Also pictured are female executives, Peek CEO Ruzwana Bashir and Sunrun co-CEO Lynn Jurich, however, as pointed out by BuzzFeed reporter Ryan Mac, they were not actually present for the picture - but rather added in after."⠀

“Laws that restrict access to abortion are not an effective way to end or greatly reduce the number of abortions because people will continue to have abortions regardless of the law. We actually know how to reduce the number of abortions. Most of those ways involve being honest about how and when people have sex and giving people the information they need to have sex responsibly.
Yet most who favor these highly restrictive laws do not seem terribly interested in pursuing policies that would do any of these things.” — Katherine Kelaidis (an anti abortion Christian)

If you would have told me in 2011 when I was winning pro-life speech contests that I would be marching to fight for reproductive rights a few years later, I would have laughed at you and called you a liar. But life’s funny that way, huh? It teaches you a few things and you grow if you start paying more attention. I heard a lot of powerful stories yesterday as I proudly stood with a lot of powerful women 💪🏼💕

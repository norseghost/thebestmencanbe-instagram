Consent, Gender and Self-Ship (self-care and self-love) - Saturday 1st June 2019, 2:30 PM – 3:30 PM @ Stour Space, 7 Roach Road, London E3 2PA

During the workshop, we will touch on definitions, myths and stereotypes and the additional barriers black women and girls face when accessing services designed to support survivors of sexual violence.

We are also an empowerment and support group for female survivors of any form of sexual violence, as well as a refuge space for black women and girls. 
We provide emotional and practical support on a daily basis through face-to-face, skype, facetime or telephone meetings. Our online live chat is also available every day of the year. 
CeeBelle provides a confidential Outreach Service across London to black women and girls aged 13+. In 2018, we expanded our remit to include Female Genital Mutilation (FGM/C). This FREE event has been organised by Kanchelli Iddrisu. Please register your interest on eventbrite.

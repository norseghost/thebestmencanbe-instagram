The moment you see things coming together.
The flower that stood out alone ( beautifully bright) is now surrounded by others as equally bright and beautiful. Don’t be afraid to stand out, to step out and just be. . .
Supporting others ( There’s a bee on the flower, maybe one I saved. Very slim chance admitted .) . Supporting the flower just doing its thing. 
You don’t always know you matter, be surprised by the strength and support you can give others by just doing what you do. They don’t need to tell you. Just know that you matter xx .

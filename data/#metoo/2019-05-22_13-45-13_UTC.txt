Ordinary people can work towards change.  Putting on this shirt from @theandrehenry puts butterflies in my stomach,  yes I’m a bit nervous.  Wearing it to my job where I interact with hundreds of people forces me to speak up, in person (not just on social media). If we don’t start and then keep talking, nothing changes.  Silence=complacency. Each one of us has a choice on how to view the world and the people in it. It doesn’t have to be this way.  #itdoesnthavetobethisway #idhtbtw #blacklivesmatter #lbgtqlivesmatter #translivesmatter #metoo #antiracism #socialjustice #change

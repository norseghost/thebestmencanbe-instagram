Just in case I accidentally portray that I have even the slightest bit of my life together ever...
.
Today was a day...
.
I had way too many expectations on my plate, and met mostly none of them.
.
I completely lost it with my babies once or twice.
.
Had some hard truth spoken to me, to be offended by it, then to realize I was offended because it was true.
.
Let God help me get okay and back on my feet, for a while at least.
.
For the bill people I was on hold with FOREVER and never even spoke to anyone to make me flustered AGAIN.
.
Have to last minute rush out the door to run some errands and rush the kids and get even more flustered.
.
To get overwhelmed with the weight of life in this season in the car.
.
Have a last minute meet up with some friends that was overwhelmingly God ordained and totally needed. .
To come home, chill, reflect on the day, learn, grow, relax and just breathe.
.
I’m only human, I get nuts over everything sometimes(often times), have to apologize for everything to everyone, and be okay with being called out. I’m a mom, a wife, a woman. Today was a “real life” day, no fluff. .
For everyone who’s human and has days; me too!

Growing up in a patriarchal global culture, we’ve been given a very clear message about what ambition should be. In a man’s world, ambition is about achievement — your success wins you validation — which acts as the necessary fuel to keep you perpetually moving up the “ladder.” It’s productive, hierarchical and — it’s monetized.

While this definition of ambition is designed for male participation, it leaves little room for the feminine. So when assertive and confident women adopt these masculine-associated codes of ambition, they are oftentimes perceived as being “aggressive” “bossy” or “boastful.” Rather than walking around in clothes that don’t fit, what would it look like if we tried on a version of ambition that was tailor-made for us?

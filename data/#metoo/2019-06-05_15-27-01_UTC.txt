Here’s what our daughter has learned during her time at Journey School in Dripping Springs.
A boy has been tormenting her, hitting, kicking, and spiting on her almost every school day. The school has done nothing until Monday night. They kicked her out. So now she thinks when she speaks up for herself, and tells on the boy to the teacher and mommy and daddy, she gets punished by not being allowed to go to school with her friends anymore. 
We spent all yesterday trying to explain to her that she did nothing wrong, but she doesn’t understand why she is being punished and neither do we.
Thanks Journey School. Starting the little girls young to accept being abused and keeping quite. Shes only 4. Maybe it has something to do with the boys mom being one of the teachers?

“The opportunist pro Israeli Apartheid,  Democrat Cory Booker is ready to piss on Human Rights so he can make sure the misery of the Democratic Party that  has abandoned  the Foundations of our Democracy, Human Rights and Social Justice for all will become a legacy of this party. But thanks to the new generations of progressive Democrats such as newly elected Congresswomen, there is a slight tiny hope that those of Democrats who have sold themselves to AIPAC will not succeed in staining the US Democracy🗽🇺🇸 with the blood of innocent Palestinian children.”R.F.

I loathe lying! As a DV survivor, I spent years living in a web of his lies. Too many decades lost. I listen to those who now spin their weaves of lies upon me and their inconsistencies. I am hyper observant. I may not give in to what I see, however I will slowly eliminate those from my life. I canâ€™t afford those whom deceive me in. Honesty is always the best policy with a DV survivor. #dating #loveyourself #loveshouldnthurt #happilysingle #empoweringwomen #strongwomen #publicspeaker #publicspeaking #dvsurvivor #ncadv #metoochallenge #metoo #stopviolence #bookme #tristate #newyork #newjersey #unstoppable #powerfulwomen #njdvmovement

And what may be a minor irritation for some can easily send you into a panic or reduce you to tears.\nToday I\u2019m going to talk about a very sensitive, current serious issue in our society. That\u2019s \u201cHarassment\u201d. \ud83c\udf1fHarassment covers a wide range of behaviors of an offensive nature. Wether physical, verbal, written, or any thing that is unwanted and unwelcomed and can offend or humiliate an individual.\nHarassment is commonly taken in a physical sense. But it can be of any kind. Like verbal, personal, psychological, cyber bullying, sexual etc..\n\u2796Infact sending Good morning texts to a women is also a harassment. & so much so if someone is constantly asking u for a cup of coffee thats also a kind of harassment. Also this could be abusive comments or jokes, graffiti or insulting gestures.\n\u27a1\ufe0fAnd one more thing most of people, when they think of harassment , their mind immediately jumps to an image of a woman being harassed or propositioned by a male coworker, supervisor or boss.\u00a0Both genders are being effected by harassment. \ud83c\udf1fwhat harassment does? It is so toxic to mental & physical health. Survivors of sexual assault experience a wide range of reactions.\u00a0Like Shock and numbness, loss of Control, fear, guilt & self blame, isolation, distrust, sexual fears, Anger etc..\n\ud83c\udf1fWhat can we do to stop \u270b\ud83c\udffb this? \ud83d\udd3aSpeak up, tell them that u are not okay with it. \ud83d\udd3aDonot delay. \ud83d\udd39 Don\u2019t wait to seek help. \ud83d\udd39Share with your friends and family don\u2019t hide this anymore.\n\ud83d\udd38 You should file a case against them.\n\ud83c\udf1fAs it is said that \u201cLittle drops of water make a mighty ocean\u201d\nSo from today onwards let\u2019s promise each other to pay our part in elimination of this \u201charassment\u201d. \ud83d\ude42 \u270c\ud83c\udffb #metoo #timesup #believesurvivors #whyididntreport #harassment #tothegirls #harassment #whyistayed #heforshe #imwithher #nevergiveup #speakyourselftour"

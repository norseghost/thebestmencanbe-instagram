This world needs women! Women who will stand bravely in their power to create change. You and I can make huge shifts in this world just by showing up and speaking up. What may seem like one small step is actually one huge step for humanity. Lets get more women into powerful political positions, more female CEO's, more female law makers, more female judges, more female policy makers, just more female everything! Let's fight the pay gap, fight the inequality, fight the discrimination, fight the patriarchy, fight the misogyny, lets be brave, be strong and be fearless! I got you sisters, lets do this together! ðŸ“· by @lovetoodesign

“The steps you take don't need to be big; they just need to take you in the right direction." - Jemma ❤️#iahsay #AgentsofSHIELD ——————————————————
I heard this while watching one of my favorite #Marvel TV shows, Agents of SHIELD , and it just really resonated with my struggle to stay congruent and focused on goals that I’m passionate to achieve. 
As I am laid up on the couch with a swollen fibula, worn tendons around my ankle, and extremely tight muscles that have twisted up my leg to my hips from walking incorrectly for years while in pain and unbalanced with chronic ankle instability, I can’t help but think about my dad... After his car wreck, he was bedridden for nearly 4 years. Cannabis assisted him in his emotional and neurological struggles to where he found himself capable of using an electric bike once in a while, swimming as often as he could, and heading out to our family farm in Texas to visit his brother. However, the pain and agony of the pain was one thing, losing his independence was truly the icing on that fucked up cake. At 31 and having always taken care of myself when not well or feeling broken, it’s not easy to ask for help. Especially from my partner who has triggers around being “bossed around” by his family. I don’t think I’m at all “bossy”, even I was a business owner and an ACTUAL boss I wasn’t even bossy... but, triggers are triggers. An experience can be simply similar to a triggering past situation yet our subconscious will accept it as the exact same circumstance and react unless we actively #practice #emotionalintelligence (#EQ ) and awareness of triggers. 
Anyways - please send #healingvibes as this is quite a thing to heal from after so much damage for so long and is keeping me from connecting and working with others, for now. On the flip side; this gives me an opportunity to focus on my book 📓✍🏻! Happy Thursday to All & remember... i am human | so are you 💜

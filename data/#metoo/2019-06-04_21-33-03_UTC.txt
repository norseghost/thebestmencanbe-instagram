After I finished Sonali Dev's Pride, Prejudice, and Other Flavors, I still felt as if I was in the world she'd built. She took the most essential parts of Pride and Prejudice and transformed them, building a modern world in the midst of an Indian family living in America. Dr. Trisha Raje, the protagonist, has been (sort of) disowned by her family after a mysterious mistake that threatens her brother's political career. When she meets DJ Caine (DJ stands for Darcy James. Ha!), their relationship seems to be built on immediate repulsion. But of COURSE (because it's a Jane Austen re-telling), that initial conflict is hiding something more. Dev uses the class conflict that lies at the heart of Pride and Prejudice and embraces the horribly awkward misunderstandings that characterize the protagonists' relationship. Over the course of the novel, she addresses the pros and cons of assimilation, the medical field, the art of cooking, the #metoo movement, racism, and police brutality . . . and so much more. And all of that is wrapped up in a subtle, complex, yearning romance that is just gorgeous. I'll definitely be reading more of Sonali Dev's catalog.

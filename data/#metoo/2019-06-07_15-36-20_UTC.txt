This book tells the true story of the struggle to free and exonerate Alfred Dreyfus. In the late 19th century he was found guilty of high treason and lived alone in imprisonment on ‘Devil’s Island’ for four years. A Jewish man, Dreyfus was the victim of antisemtisim which had always been rife in France and the rest of Europe. As I read this book I teared up at the suffering he went through and his bravery and continued loyalty to his country. The ‘Dreyfus Affair’ divided France and people such as Emile Zola worked hard, often at their own expense, to bring justice to his cause. He was eventually reinstated as a major in the French Army where he served during WWI.

I would like to recommend this book, but after researching it and discovering that Harris wrote the script to a movie directed by his ‘friend’ Roman Polanski, I can’t do that. Having Polanski attached to this project is morally repugnant to me. I don’t ever write reviews like this but I’m fed up with this type of crap. Please support people who aren’t known child abusers or their friends.

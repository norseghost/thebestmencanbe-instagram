A birthday wish 🎂...
.
.
Anybody that really knows me knows that I don’t like to announce birthdays.  Believe it or not I don’t really like the attention.  But really, as a survivor of PTSD this day has layered meanings.  It’s another year of life but also a reminder of those that I’ve lost and the sobering thought of why I get to keep on living and they don’t.  It’s a triggering time for me.  So I pretty much went on throughout my life avoiding it.  I know my life has meaning, I know I have an amazing daughter to love and live for, and I know it’s all a work in progress...but it’s trauma and it’s a messy process.  I will have to wrestle my way through this for probably the rest of my life but if there’s one thing I know it’s this...I’m happy to be alive, I’m grateful for the people in my life, I’m thankful that I’m Brooklyn’s father, and...I will never give up trying to do whatever I can to make the world a better place.  Cuz in the end that’s a life worth living 💜🤴🏾

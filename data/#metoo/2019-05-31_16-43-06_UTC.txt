Choked on the words I couldn't let out
Screamed at the walls 
Cried to the clouds
.
No one heard them
I couldn't let them out
I didn't know what happened
.
Numb
Dumb
.
Was it my fault?
Was it good that I called out?
No one believes
.
I'll forever be afraid of New places
I'll never trust new faces.
.
You don't want to see the things I couldn't see.
~Myself, with everyone

Always remember you have more strength in you than you ever thought possible, and you can get through, and overcome anything. ~
You will be believed, the truth will out......those that hurt and lie always get found out and caught in a web of their own making
~
I smile because we have got through, survived.....and justice will be done. ~
Going through a court hearing, having to re-live experiences that have took a long time to come to terms with is one of the hardest things I'll ever do. But I did it, it's done, I'm strong......

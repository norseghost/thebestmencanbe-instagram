What Biden said may seem harmless to you. Take another look. What Biden is communicating to these boys is that a man’s job is to regulate the sexuality of the women in his family. Not only does this deny a woman’s autonomy and ability to make her own decisions regarding her body, but it also makes men think they can and should control a woman’s sexuality as though she were property unable to make her own decisions. It’s old school benevolent misogyny, and it’s not okay. Lastly, as women across the country are losing their rights to decide whether to bare life, if you don’t think Biden’s antiquated behavior is a problem, you may be the problem. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk! 👍🏾 #Biden #MeToo #Progress

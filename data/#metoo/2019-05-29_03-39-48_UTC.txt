I'm not holding back dear #metoo and #timesup and #femisitmovement and #newmedia y'all have a #problem #problem. This man #martinlutherkingjr has been dead for 51 years. His wife been dead for 12 years. Y'all have the gualls to say he had affairs and a friend raped someone. I see y'all have nothing to do. What is real news dying out??? I refuse to let you bury and #destory #martainlutherkingjr  #legacy. You hated him when he was alive you rewrote his image and speeches after his death. Now you want to do this. I get it Y'all got so hard off from getting #cosby locked up y'all can't control y'all selfe it's like sex to them. This is the second dead black man this year the media and the rest want to take down. Y'all wanted to #cancelledmichealjackson. Now this bull shit.  Come on leave #martainlutherkingjralone. Let the man rest in peace y'all took. Him from his children and his wife and from us. No more of this no more.

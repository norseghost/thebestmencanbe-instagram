🌟RISE🌟
For #mentalhealthawareness month I thought I would open up about my toughest part of my journey...my mental health💛
I Like how in this pic I don’t look super happy and actually more tired bc what it actually took to RISE was moment to moment choosing what I was going to believe no matter what I was going through. Oh my gosh was this by far my biggest nightmare. 
I’ve learned now...and I’ll share to give HOPE to others or even if you have kids what to look for...I’ve learned now that I have all the markers in my blood work for “PANDAS” or “PANS” which means all those times I had strep throat that it went into my brain. It caused me to be Super OCD and I never told anyone bc I had nothing to compare it to but I chewed the same amount of each bite of food on both sides of my mouth before I would swallow each bite all through my childhood. I had high highs and low lows. I wouldn’t wear shorts bc when I sat down they were uneven. I had to have everything even, if I didn’t I would overreact...even if I didn’t tell anyone and just overeact inside. I also zoned out all the time but would know everything being said. I’ve learned this was repeated strep that went to my brain.
As a teen I suffered traumas and a life changing (brain changing) cheer accident from a basket toss stunt that left me homebound, in physical therapy, learning to walk again, back spasms, and doing class at home. The drs said I would never dance again...I’m strong willed and I was determined to prove them wrong🙌🏼
After this w added trauma I developed ADD and depression. I attempted suicide at 17 after rape and injury etc. I ended up in a dark and then darker place. I put my all into helping and loving others bc I didn’t love me. I went to therapy,counseling, got on many high dose psych meds etc. one of the meds gave me intrusive thoughts and psychosis...my first experience w that.
As an adult I got off meds for psych bc of so many side affects and was determined to do things naturally. By this point I learned self talk helped a lot...eating clean..exercise..making myself be around others when I wanted to isolate..lots of time w God and letting Him heal my hurt..etc. continued in 2 comments

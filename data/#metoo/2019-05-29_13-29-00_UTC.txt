Well Instafriends, I finally made an Instagram for Recognize Theatre! Please follow us @recognizetheatre (we got our handle! I was very excited)

I started a theatre company so I could produce work that I thought was important. Work which started a conversation about gender and sexuality. Since creating the company I've found that artists and audiences are both starved for an outlet to discuss these important aspects of our lives and I can't wait to continue the conversation! Keep up with us on Instagram and Facebook!

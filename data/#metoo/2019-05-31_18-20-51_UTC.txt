Lmao via @tracih68 this might be too much for the normies to handle. It's all true!! Ha! But taking all that aside, lets "believe" a woman accusing a man of rape 30 years ago with NO witnesses NO proof. She never went to local authorities concerning this "rape" she went to Diane finstein. Amy Coney Barret better buckle up. The Dems are pure evil. The #fakenews made you believe this. But what about Fairfax of Virginia? #democraticprivilege if you're a dem you can beat and or rape women all day. #metoo is a joke. #feminism is a joke. #wakeupamerica #garth ðŸ¤¢ I know this is an old story, I'm sorry I couldn't help myself. Iâ€™m just very frustrated that this woman is off with her go fund me money and not brought up on charges

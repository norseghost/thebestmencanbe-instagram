Posting this for anyone who needs it. I wish it was that simple for me. I honestly don’t think I’ve had one day where I haven’t been stressing about something. This week has been worse. Stressing about my abuser’s release date, stressing over flashbacks, stressing about what’s wrong with me where people can’t keep their word. I could go on & on. #survivor #MeToo #SupportSurvivors

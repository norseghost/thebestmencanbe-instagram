Today I don’t have much to say/ except I am extremely grateful for aging. I’m extremely grateful for times in my life that hit my lowest of lows so I could enjoy the highest of highs. Some of my projects I am doing right now are HARD guys, and I don’t mean that in just a technical and process way, but also in subject matter. One of my series is focusing on sexual abuse and sexual harassment/ and or unwanted encounters. BUT, through this project I have gotten to connect, to empower but most importantly, to listen. I have spoken with men and women about hard experiences but always always walk away feeling so.. connected and empowered, but not for me, for them. I can’t wait to show you what I’m creating behind the scenes. I can’t wait to show you all how these instances will change us, grow us, but never define us. #apaigephotography

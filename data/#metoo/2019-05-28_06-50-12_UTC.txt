Friendship is what love aspires to be. Without dependency, proximity, sexuality or intimacy, true friendship suffers no loss of authenticity. It is permanent, and even the creation of another true friendship cannot shake it!
I don’t know where I would be without my friends, but I know it wouldn’t be a good place.
And here’s one of them.
Love ya’s. Thanks for being there. I hope you know I’m there for you too 👊🏼♥️🤙🏼 Always.

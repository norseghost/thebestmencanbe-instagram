What an awesome, yet paradoxical interview; a white liberal interviewing a black trumper. #hmmm, for most blacks it’s hard to digest. •

#DavidLetterman, legend in Late Night Television now @netflix phenomenon Interviews rap superstar #kanyewest on his #netflix original “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman .” #S2, first I watched #Ellen’s interview E2, found @letterman’s interview style skilled and comforting: she was in good hands👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿. Still a bit hesitant to watch Kanye. S2E3, now #tiffanyhaddish’s 😭👌🏾 so brave and relatable. So, I was inspired to be brave and watched S2E1. ✨✨✨

I didn’t want to watch because of his #tmz “sounds like a choice to me” ‘rant’, though I think he was taken out of context. Me, being so tied up in public opinion; excommunicated him from my creative atmosphere. Then I heard him say “ My power is the ability to not be influenced.” In my living room I applauded. My applause goes to people that despite public perception live their truth honestly.•

I then realized, we can’t want  a world where freedom is rule, then label someone crazy because they exercise that freedom.

Midway the interview, he did it again, he expressed his opinion and concerns about the inability to have a conversation in the #metoo movement. “Men in powerful positions are like, what did I do for the last 30yrs- that level of fear took place.” People understand that as a predator sympathizer, discounting the pain of the victims. But, I understood him from the perspective - there is so much fear in society to not be seen as a sympathizer that the presumption of innocence that we all have a right to, for men has been invalidated.
I have many opinions on that, but I understand  that’s his owned stand point.

It’s so funny that David lettermen was my medium for clarifications on Kanye. Lol. This interview gave me a glimpse into the creative genius that informs his music. #ye is 🔥🔥🔥 @kanyew.est have the album on #replay. You’re back for me, creativity through a brand new lens.. #independentmind 
Side note- I love #krisjenner‘s Camino. 😝 #mutha!!! ✨✨✨

To every man reading this, we're so sorry. ðŸ’” We know it's hard to share and be vulnerable because you've been taught the wrong definition of manning up by all of us. We hope you find guidance and someone you can talk to, whether professional or among friends/family. Here for you. We believe you.

Your mental health is important.

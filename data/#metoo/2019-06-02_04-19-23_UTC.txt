I didn’t want to make this public because it feels extremely violating to my personal privacy but she decided to make this issue public by spreading malicious untrue defamatory rumors about me. Not only has she spoken ill of me during and after our friendship but she has violated personal boundaries that I made clear, and verbally abused to the point that I had a panic attack. I am only making this to defend myself and speak up in case anyone believes her lies. I am not your silent victim, I will speak up and speak out. You have went to far and I’m done. I’ve been nothing but respectful towards you, never once did I utter any insults or untrue statements about you. I will be taking measures for my personal safety starting now but I will extend the issue farther if she takes her abuse towards me farther. I attempted on multiple occasions to resolve the issue amicably but she has made it clear that it is not a possibility because 1) she becomes aggressive and abusive and unable to talk to and 2) she will completely disregard my boundaries and 3) even a year later she persists her harassment by coming over announced and behaving rudely and spreads rumors about me. Keep in mind these are not just petty rumors, they are serious rumors that I have spoken about in the text. I have no ill will, I just went her to stop. I will gladly take this post down if she accepts to stop bothering me, I won’t require an abuser to acknowledge their abuse because they usually don’t.#metoo #emotionalabuse #toxicrelationships #survivor

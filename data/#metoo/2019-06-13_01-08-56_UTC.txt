In women, there is an authentic empowerment & love for ourselves + others that organically emerges when shame is unveiled. Shame is a concealed, contagious, & self-deteriorating emotion. It detours you from the truth of who you are at your essence👑
⠀⠀
You’ll notice in very small children, there will be an innate sense of freedom & innocence in their bodies & self image. As we've grown up in society, we've soaked up the strong underlying current of immense shame for our bodies & womanhood. Since we don't meet the expectations of advertisements, media, & porn, we assume "something must be wrong with me. I'm not enough. I am too much." Each part of our body has a different story about how it should be more perfect. And through socialization, we are affirmed some of this, creating even deeper wounds💔
⠀⠀
So of course it makes total sense that we forget the truth. We forget our unique beauty. We forget our worthiness. We forget our belonging. We forget we are imperfectly perfect. We forget our unconditional love. We forget our power.
⠀⠀
We long to remember 
because at our core, we do remember!✨
⠀⠀
🌜We remember when we give the different parts of ourselves the love they need.
🌜We remember when we choose our own story about human bodies, sensuality, & sexuality.
🌜We remember when we create embodied experiences in our physical reality that affirm our body’s intelligence & normality.
🌜We remember when we see the unique beauty in women and when they see the unique beauty within us.
🌜We remember when we receive & give loving support to our insecurities & judgments.
⠀⠀
Let's re-remember the truth together. We did not come to this earth forgetting. We came knowing. It's within us.👭👭👭

(Just a rant)
A real apology requires:
•Truly admitting your fault.
•Fully taking responsibility.
•Humbly and politely asking for forgiveness.
•Immediately changing *or try to change* behaviour.
•Actively and considerably rebuilding trust.
But if these are not the ways a person who hurt you is apologizing and instead showing you signs like victim-playing, taking you on a guilt trip, changing narrations in front of others, trying to cut off people in your life by manipulating them, trying to turn your friends against you, trying to be the 'more mature' ones and blaming the hurt on you,.... just know that right there you're dealing with a narcissist and there's NO WAY you can make them realise of what they did to you. 
They'll give excuses and justifications to people around you and try to make you the bad guy. 
They'll keep on telling you all the things they did for you and would never care to acknowledge your efforts because let's be honest, it was never about you. .
If you're a narcissist just know that:
•It's manipulative and ugly to tell a person that their hurt is not valid, that they're just being 'dramatic' or it's not that big of a deal.
•You don't get to choose if your actions or words hurt a person or not, all you need to do is consider that action of yours, take responsibility and apologize for it- not for the sake of not letting the person be happy with someone else, not for the sake of just saying sorry, not for the sake of bragging later of how mature you were, not for the sake of holding this incident as a leverage anytime something goes wrong- apologize only when you mean it, when you care enough to look at your mistakes, when you care enough to change your ugly behaviours for the person you love.
•And if you can't do that, I'm sorry, but you should let them go. Don't hold them hostage of your hideous personality. Let them be loved by people who offer them the love they deserve, let them fall in love with themselves, let them be free to make their own decisions in life, let them live.
•Your ways are suffocating and you are preying on someone else's happiness, which makes you the shittiest of all.

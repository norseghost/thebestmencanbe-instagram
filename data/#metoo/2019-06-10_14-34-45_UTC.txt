just because we donâ€™t see as much in men (we see it a lot still) doesnâ€™t mean it doesnâ€™t exist. ALL body shaming is wrong.  never ever do it. also now thatâ€™s it is summer, donâ€™t point out any stretch marks, cuts, sweat stains, anything. donâ€™t make people feel uncomfortable. we cool on that? great. ~ðŸŒ·

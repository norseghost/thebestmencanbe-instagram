❤️Thank you @lasanchiz & @mariasoriaortiz for believing, for encouraging me to immerse myself embodying this amazing, heartbreaking & especially overwhelming life story of the strongest woman, mother, female, still loving, still capable of being SUCH, after being raped by her own son, told by the one and only Wajdi Mouawad. 
To every being out there who’s ever and in any way, been forced against their will: I EMBRACE you with all the strength, love, beauty, life, breath, beat, kindness, humanity, spirit, peace and energy that my being can possibly carry.🙌🏾

Do you believe your #imagination is just wishful thinking?  What if your imagination was wishful thinking from the #5D world that simply has yet to #manifest into the #3D world?  And what if the only things stopping your imagination from becoming real is:
1. Holding onto the belief your imagination is bogus? (Where does that belief come from anywho!?!?)
2. Thinking you know how your 5D creation will look once it comes down into 3D?

If this is true, why are you stopping yourself from believing in your imagination? 
If this is true, how wildly would you allow your imagination to roam ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜‹ðŸ’«ðŸŽ‰ðŸ‘Š!?!?

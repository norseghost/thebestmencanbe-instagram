Song: Polygraph Eyes
Artist: Yungblud

Meaning of song: By writing from the perspective of a man taking advantage of a woman, rather than a woman taken advantage of, Yungblud brings attention to the creepiness and unacceptable nature of 'lad culture.' Although the song ties into the #METOO movement that has gained traction in recent years, Yungblud has mentioned that he recalls seeing these sorts of behaviours when he was as young as 14. Yungblud has stated several times that this song has a lot of meaning to him, and has stated in a video that he believes this song 'should remain on the forefront of our minds and needs to be talked about to make the issue obsolete.' Pros: Strong message, good rhythm, powerful 
Cons: None 
My overall opinion: Everytime I listen to this song, I find it more and more emotional. 
The vocals are absolutely spot on, and Yungblud has an emotional tone to his voice in this particular song. 
The beat of the song is also emotional, especially with the violin, making the song more dramatic and having it be more powerful

Rating out of 5: 5/5

PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder)
-
It affects more people than you know.
-
It includes our children or adults who have been affected by violent homes and/or neighborhoods, sexual assault or abuse and many other traumatic events.
-
I battled this as a 15 year old sexual assault survivor and it affected my academics and personal life.
-
Mental health must be maintained just as much as you do your annual check ups.
-
Address trauma by connecting your children or yourself with the help of medical professionals to get to tools to maintain a piece of mind.

Teens are being lured into sex trafficking all around us and many parents still don’t believe it can happen to their child!
We continue to implore you to talk to your kids about the dangers that lurk in public spaces, even familiar spaces like the mall and school. These traffickers are not the weird looking guy in a van. They look like “regular, nice guys” who say the right things to make a girl feel special.
Parents.....talk to your teen girls about not engaging guys they meet at the mall. Even if you think your teen would know better than to leave the mall with someone they don’t know or eventually meet up with a guy they met at the mall, HAVE THE CONVERSATION ANYWAY. Teens make poor decisions all the time - they are still kids.
Also, while this article says they don’t know if one of the suspects used his access to students when he performed at local high schools, it is very possible that he did. Therefore, we encourage you to talk to your kids about how other students and “young guys” also use schools as their feeding grounds.
This is very real and we have to take it seriously. We can’t afford to be naive and act as if it can’t happen to our kids. Race, religion, nor financial status excludes you! In fact, traffickers have said they prefer girls from “good homes with money” because they want to prove they aren’t soft. Others say they go after the girls who seemingly don’t have anyone because they are looking for love and acceptance. No one is exempt.....
Do you know where your teens are and who they’re talking to? Better yet, do you know who is trying to talk to them?  #childsexabuseawareness #stopchildsexabuse #childsexabusesurvivor #parentsofchilldsexabusesurvivor #sexualassault #endchildsexabuse #endrapeculture #childabuse #sextrafficking #atlanta #ATL #Georgia #church #girls #teens #awareness #rapevictim #victim #children #prevention #trafficking  #survivor #tips #blogger #speaker #metoo #advocate #volunteer  #socialmedia

I’m working on letting go of the residual hate, fear, shame, anxiety, anger, and negativity that I’ve felt as a result of experiencing bullying (online and in person), harassment, abuse, betrayal, trauma, assault ...generally I try to keep this account positive and full of love, but I’m taking a moment to acknowledge that real life is gritty and tough and not always so pleasant...send me a dm if you’d like to discuss! Thanks for reminding me of how far I’ve come in this journey called life @saraerenthalart ! #wcw #honesty #artgram #art #streetart #urbanart #cityart #graffitiart #graffitiporn #graffiti #grateful #greenestqarth #nyc #nycart #instagram #metoo #instagraffiti #love #trippy #psychedelicart #not_just_walls #feminist #rsa_graffiti #dsb_graff #jj_urbanart #streetarteverywhere #nycstreetart #streetartglobe #letgo #dsb_noir

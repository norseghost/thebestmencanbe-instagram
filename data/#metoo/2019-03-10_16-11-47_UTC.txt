When I was at school, the boys used to play a game called ‘Fire-Truck’. They’d place their sweaty finger tips on my knees and begin running their hands up my thighs. ‘Say ‘red light’ when you want me to stop’, they’d say. I’d quickly gasp ‘red light’, to which the sickening response was ‘fire-trucks don’t stop for red lights’.

I don’t really have much to say about this. So many feelings spring to mind, but no words. Someone reminded me of this recently and I was shocked. Shocked to learn how accepting I was of this. Shocked to learn how early toxic masculinity was instilled. Shocked at how soon the idea of consent was diluted and mocked.

Consent needs to be taught, learned and respected. Consent is not a joke.

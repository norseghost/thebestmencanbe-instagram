Fairly disappointed in the #usitt exhibition at #pq2019 
According to the exhibit, it was meant to showcase America's "immigrant roots," but featured the work of primarily white designers.

Situated next to Mexico's politically charged exhibition, it was embarrassing to me as an American to see absolutely no obvious visible acknowledgement of the violence that we've perpetrated against Mexico, and no reflection of the work of marginalized groups who have risen up over the troubling past four years through movements like #blacklivesmatter, #metoo, and #transvisibity

It made me realize that as theatre artists in the U.S., we have a long way to go before we catch up to the rest of the world in terms of expanding our narrow definition of scenography and performance.

Seeing the Brazilian and Hong Kong exhibitions shut down in solidarity with political activists at home makes me wonder why we weren't doing the same?

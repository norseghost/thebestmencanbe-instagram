| SUMMER TBR - 2/3 |

How do you choose which books to buy? I have a very trusty group of friends who have very similar literary tastes. We are always telling each other about the amazing books we discovered and draft up a TBR. They are to blame a lot for my over the top expensive and extreme book buying over the last year. We are always urging each other to buy our favourite books, especially when Amazon or Flipkart have great deals. A lot of the books on my Summer TBR, divided into three parts, have been bought at their express recommendations. Here is Part II.

Putney is a contemporary spin in the age of #MeToo along the lines of Nabokov's Lolita and talks about consent and the abuse of power. Of Birds and Birdsong is a collection of essays on nature and ecology of India centred on the vibrant variety of birds on our subcontinent. The Way to the Spring talks of the everyday struggles of Palestinian life under the Israeli occupation. We Crossed A Bridge collects intimate wartime testimonies and poetic fragments from Syrians whose lives have been changed by revolution, war, and flight. Romantic Outlaws explored the trajectories of a pair of visionary women, a mother and a daughter. Wollstonecraft and Shelley should have shared a life, but they instead share a powerful literary and feminist legacy.

The Vagrant Trilogy is a post-apocalyptic series which melds the elements of fantasy and science-fiction. It features among other things, sentient swords and ancient demon technology. Borne is a thrilling vision of life in its most radical forms and explores the question of non-human sentience after the biotech apocalypse. Norwegian Wood is the story of Toro Watanabe, a Japanese college student and his relationship with the fragile, wistful and melancholic Naoko. Orlando is Woolf's pioneering novel, a trans triumph about a hero who becomes a heroine and loves men and women alike. Dear Life, my first Munro, is a vibrant collection of stories about moments of change, chance encounters, the twist of fate that leads a person to a new way of thinking or being.

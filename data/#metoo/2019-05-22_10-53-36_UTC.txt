Todayâ€™s thought:  Taking beauty from ashes, means life continues on after a disaster. It is how we take those ashes, if we begin to rebuild from our heart and soul, it is then we have all we ever wanted or needed!  The pain becomes a memory, taking your beauty your ashes means starting fresh and new. Sometimes it is taking your experiences through those times, helping others going through a similar hurt, you will begin to heal. You build your inner strength from the courage you took to rebuild what was lost.  You may be different from the disaster or situations that was put into your life, but still amazingly beautiful if you allow your heart to guide you back. You will draw people in, some you help, those to support you and lastly people who will help you.  After time building the beauty, your vision and purpose becomes so clear!  Building beauty from my ashes had me seeing what was wrong, what was I necessary in my life to leave, where I needed to go and what was most important to me.  I still have frays and holes in my life that still are undergoing the repair process. Relationships that shouldn't have been broken but are beyond my control. Those relationships I pray for and I know once the truth is learned, the repairs will begin.  Once I changed my thinking to stop seeing the ashes, but the beauty that came from it, I know I am completely free to grow and have an open heart to whatever God puts my way. My first photo is a columbine a flower that symbolizes faith, hope and love.  It wasn't any surprise it was on my path walking up to the castle ruins. What a blessing to be able to see it and photograph a beautiful and unique flower!  I appreciate every day many blessings!! XO Mary

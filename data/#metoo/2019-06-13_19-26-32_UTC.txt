What do you think?

When I heard our guest on Episode 2 of #BecomingHER pose this question, my heart stopped. And my mind starting darting for answers. I don’t know that I have an answer, but I do know in my personal life that I give some toxic people more grace than I give others.

For example, I would say that my ex-boyfriend didn’t really love me. Of course, we had our good moments, but his toxic ‘love’ is not at all how I want to define love.

Yet, with certain toxic family members of mine, I would say that they do love me—that they’re trying their best even if their best is toxic or abusive.

I wish I had the answers, but I don’t. What are your thoughts?

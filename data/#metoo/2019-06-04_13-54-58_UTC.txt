One of the men who sexually assaulted me is in court today. "Things were *different* then..." (in the 90s) he, and others, have said. Actually, non-consensual penetration has NEVER been OK. The abuse was painful, and being told by my family to keep silent about it, equally so. 
External events in the past year prompted me to take the matter to the police and there's enough 'contemporaneous evidence' for him to be prosecuted. Court isn't an option for everybody who has been abused, but it's crucially important not to bottle up such a degrading experience.

I urge everyone to try and find their voice by whatever means possible. Now that I have broken my silence I am letting out a rush of feeling in my stonecarvings, and find that art is powerful and healing.
(This sculpture was made from a broken kerbstone-- the break is still visible on top. I used the remnant as a base).

Men still offer me lavish vacations thinking that on the condition that they pay for everything, they will receive a gift. 
While they are after something that is sacred, their eyes can‚Äôt see beyond the many gifts that I carry.

I thank God for showing me my gifts, because I am able to judge them... by the fruits that they carry; most of the time they lack what I carry.

My gifts aren‚Äôt on the market.  It‚Äôs for the Kingdom and deserving for one King‚ù§Ô∏è Naw I‚Äôm not who they told you I use to be... I know better now‚úçüèΩ #luvher #iamher #metoo #selflove #selfcare #womenempowerment #sistercircle #sisterhood #sistersquad #sisterhood #iluvher #godisreallove #women #love #healing #healher #powher #powerfulwomen #powherful #spiritualhealer #healer

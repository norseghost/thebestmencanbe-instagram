OK!
•
I am going to be totally blunt with those who abuse social-media platforms, such as Instagram, just to name one; as a place to sexual harass, bully, troll, etc. back the ₣U₡ƙ Ø₣₣!
•
In fact back the ₣U₡ƙ λ₩λ¥ from anyone you feel should be your victim.
You were not born with some sort of innate power that enables you to abuse others.
In fact, this sort of thinking and behavior shows how powerless you really are; and how you cannot control yourself urges.
•
I am speaking on behalf of everyone you have hurt or want to hurt, we are not here for your own personal gratification.
And We Will Not tolerate being verbally abused by those of you, who have in some sick way, justified your sick behavior to mistreat any of us.
•
I am not an option, nor is anyone else!
•
We are human beings, we are daughters, sons, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, wives, husbands, friends.
•
After many years of not feeling deserving of love, I’ve spent an extended period of time reversing that way of thinking and have learned that I very much was born to be loved and that I am deserving of my own love.
•
It feels so good to accept myself just the way I am and to know my self-worth.
•
With that being said,
I am a lioness ready to bite the head off of any predator who sees me as their victim and tries to pounce on me.
•
If you find yourself constantly scrolling and trolling for someone to get your quick fix, do society a favor and seek help.
•
Not One Human Being breathing the same air as you is an option!
• 
We are all here for a purpose, and that purpose IS NOT for you to be a jackass

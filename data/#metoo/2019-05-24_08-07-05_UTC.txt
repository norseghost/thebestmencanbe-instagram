Three women have come forward with allegations of sexual abuse by teachers while they were high school students, inspired by revelations in The Teacher's Pet podcast: "Ms Hood said she had lived with the shame and guilt of the experience throughout her life, but after listening to The Teacher's Pet podcast she was inspired to tell her story.

The Teacher's Pet is a podcast by The Australian's Hedley Thomas that investigated the alleged murder of Lynette Dawson in the early 1980s.In the series, it was revealed Lynette's husband Chris Dawson, a teacher at Sydney's Cromer High School, was in a relationship with one of his students. The podcast also details a 'culture' of abuse against Cromer High School students by their teachers in the 1980s. ... Ms Hood spoke to her friend 'Nicole' — who wished to remain anonymous for this article — and started a Facebook page called Teacher's Pets Released, offering support and encouragement to other students who may have had a similar experience at the school.

Nicole said the response to the group so far was overwhelming. 'We've got a spreadsheet now to keep track of the volume,' she said. 'To date, we've got about 40 former students who reported either their own experience, or someone else's experience close to them, that involves approximately 13 teachers so far,' she said."

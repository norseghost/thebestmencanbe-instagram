This brings me back to school. .
.
I see this quote at the office today. My heart bursted. .
.
I have been taught to much. I have learned so much. It is now up to me to give back. To provide people with the education that they need. .
.
Not only that it is up to me to use the tools and resources effectively. .
.
Life isn't about having your path drawn out for your. Or paved for your liking. It's all about the unknown. But you have to take that step in.

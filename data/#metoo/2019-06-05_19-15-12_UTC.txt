“How are you so strong, Chelsea?”
.
This is a question, I hear time and time again.

But…
.
The question you should be asking is…
.
“WHEN DID YOU DECIDE YOU WASNT?”
.
See the thing that I notice is, we look at people who share their story, who stand up and show their vulnerability, those who stand in their power… as a strength!

Like they have pure courage and bravery to be themselves and go after what they want.

However, when we turn and look at ourselves to do the same thing, the thought of being vulnerable… somehow it becomes a weakness?

As if it’s a battle we lose by showing the things that make us vulnerable…
.
Vulnerability isn’t about winning or losing.

Vulnerability is about having the courage to be seen, as you, your true self.

Being prepared to put yourself out there with no control of the outcome.

If more people did that, we wouldn’t feel so disconnected.

We could be honest when we are struggling or not afraid to go after the things we want, without being worried about the judgment of others if we fail.

What could you do if you realised you don’t have to be invincible…or perfect?

What if you realised that by being vulnerable you can uncover your true strength and true potential?

What could you achieve if you decided you were strong too?

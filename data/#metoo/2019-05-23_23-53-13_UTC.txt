A new study from Lean In has found that 60% of male managers said they’re uncomfortable working closely with women: "Even before Me Too, men were more likely to mentor or advise other men, said Rachel Thomas, president of LeanIn.org. Men were also more likely to 'sponsor' more junior male employees... That men are doing even less of this work in the wake of MeToo adds 'insult to injury,' Thomas said. 'If men want to be part of the solution, then pulling away from women is the wrong thing to do.' ... Some men also like to claim that women are fabricating claims. Those fears are largely unfounded, Thomas said. She points out that the same myth surrounds sexual assault. False accusations make up a very low percentage of reported rapes, according to several studies — in line with other types of crime. When you factor in the percentage of sexual assaults that go unreported, the proportion of false reports goes down even more.

And considering the negative attention and career risks for women who speak up — I have spoken with dozens of women who’ve lost jobs, or have been blacklisted from entire industries, or even wind up homeless — the idea that women voluntarily make up harassment for personal gain seems even more preposterous. ... 'My real message is: Get over it,' Thomas said. 'You know what respectful behavior is. If for some reason you’re still reticent, don’t use that as an excuse. There are easy ways to give women equal access and support.'" Read more: https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/me-too-backlash-getting-worse_n_5cddd96de4b00e035b8ce786

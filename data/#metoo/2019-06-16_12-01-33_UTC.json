                        "text": "Essentially Shaft is a \u2018black\u2019 film, and surprisingly a bit \u2018old school\u2019 for the #metoo generation, as Samuel Jackson is as usual rather winning as Shaft.  The \u2018run down\u2019 is that Shaft (originally Richard Roundtree, who shows up later) has a son Junior Shaft one would suppose.  He\u2019s an FBI employee and is somewhat \u2018square\u2019 compared to Jackson\u2019s Shaft who hasn\u2019t seen his son in 20 years.  When the young man meets his dad again, to enlist him in the mysterious death of a friend, our hero Shaft is singing the virtues of the more sexual aspects of a woman\u2019s persona.  Jackson is from another era and is aware of the revisionist culture storm that surrounds an older black man of his note.  He won\u2019t go down without a fight.  There are some laughs in this, although you could feel some of the more cautious members of an audience button up at such antics!  Jackson\u2019s familiar voice and tenor are pretty much this entire production, and for the most part it works.  Black culture from way back seems to have never left Shaft, he\u2019s certainly tough, but this is a tongue in cheek production mostly, light and relaxed, shootings and fights are certainly skimping on reality when it\u2019s Shaft\u2019s turn to shoot.  The bullet always seems to hit the mark!  By the time legendary Richard Roundtree shows up it\u2019s any wonder it took quite a long time to get to him.  The three Shafts essentially give the bad guys the Shaft.  Only that the story here doesn\u2019t feel all that essential to the film, Shaft Jr.\u2019s best buddy dead of an OD feels rather distant and unimportant by films end. \n6.5 Out Of 10\n\nIf you know \u2018the hood\u2019 as they say, you might find Shaft to your liking, if you like Samuel Jackson this film is one you won\u2019t want to miss.  Mr. Jackson\u2019s winning enough as it is, and Shaft just may have more to say in our future, as the three Shafts: Roundtree, Jackson and Junior may be the start of a new and beautiful friendship. \n#CLAYSMOVIEREVIEWS #movie #movies #film #films\n#cinema #instamovie #instamovies\n#moviefan #moviereview #review\n#critic #filmcritic #critical #moviecritic\n#rated #cinema #reviews #moviereviews\n#SHAFT #SAMUELJACKSON #BLACKSPLOITATION\n#BLACKFILM"

Do you still think about what someone said about your looks years ago?
•
I just got an email from a woman telling me at 17 she overheard boys saying another Sara was hot but that Sara (her) was ugly.
•
A few years later a boss told her she “wasn’t pretty enough” to be an event planner.
•
A couple years ago I complimented an acquaintance on her arms + she immediately told me she’s self-conscious of them bc of something a girl said in junior high.
•
In my 20’s a well-meaning boyfriend told me “not to lose too much weight or my boobs would get smaller”.
•
I’m so thankful for the #MeToo movement around physical assault, physical touch, sexual innuendos.
•
And I wonder if the layer beneath is that words can haunt us for just as long; that they don’t have to be sexual, can be about our body + our beauty, + be just as damaging.
•
May we choose our words carefully.
•
May we teach our kids how damaging one comment in the lunchroom can be.
•
And may we release those unkind words, not continuing to give power those individuals.
•
This week’s @yourewelcomepodcast is LIVE NOW + on 3 lies about our beauty. It’s the encouragement + true words your soul needs. ❤️

PS Do you have a comment you still recall? (In sharing, let’s let it go.) Or if it’s hard to share just a “❤️” below that we’re not alone.

"One thing Iâ€™m super grateful for, is for the gift, excitement and empathy to tell peopleâ€™s stories." - @mirabellemorah

WHY?

Because itâ€™s just crazy! Really. Itâ€™s just provided me with the experience of many things, and Iâ€™ll always be grateful that stories have let me view and understand the world differently, itâ€™s let me spread peopleâ€™s ideas, tell people about other peopleâ€™s experiences, and helped me discover stuff about my own self.

And this 2019 â€” with major help and advise from Her Network of course! â€” I wrote down this list of things I thought I wanted to majorly focus on. Then I set out to work on them, but I was pretty hard on myself for the first half of the year.

Looking back at my plans to work/focus on my storytelling and communications skillset, itâ€™s amazing to see how much growth I made, how much new knowledge came in (it was really frustrating learning a lot of new concepts and still not understand what I was learning) and how much it made me diversify into working on some other exciting fields related to digital communications!

Saying yes to consciously building this gift/skillset this 2019, was like saying yes to purpose, and Iâ€™m grateful for this.

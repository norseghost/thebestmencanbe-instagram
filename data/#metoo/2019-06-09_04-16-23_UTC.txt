i wonder what you find so funny about forced sex and silence dissent - rape jokes
i mean, is it really that hilarious that as a 9 year old, a 20 - something year old with two kids and a wife - shoved his hand down the front of my skirt and into my underwear? i guess i can see the joke - its me as a child too young to recognize what was going on and unable to verbalize my wishes for him to stop; my lack of capability is embarrassing, right? & im still waiting for the cameras to pop out of my closet and the tv host to announce how ive been pranked - because its so funny it should be everyones entertainment. when i was 19 my boyfriend took advantage of me when i was upset over my grandmas terminal cancer and shoved my voice into the pits of my stomach before twisting my insides in estranged directions. i wish i had photographs of x-rays showing the scars in my insides that he left me as a parting gift because theyre just so fucked up its funny and i mean, i guess i can see the humor in my bodies defense reaction that rendered me paralyzed - it was like how an animal plays dead so they wont become prey but i guess it doesnt work the same for humans because i was still his food at the end of the day. so aim your pistol towards me and remove the safety, open old wounds that took me 10 years to heal so i can relive that pain all in the name of comedy. pull the trigger and remind me that women are still not and will never be equal to the status of men; that women and their struggles will forever be the punchline.

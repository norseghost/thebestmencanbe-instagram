Michelle Williams spoke these bold words on a panel with other women discussing changes in the workplace thanks to the #metoo movement.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

"Now, I'm greeted with a handshake instead of a morning grope," she said, and her fellow panel members nodded in agreement.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We want to see more women like Michelle feel empowered to share their stories. We're curious: what changes have you seen in daily life and in society since the start of the #metoo movement?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

I become frustrated when I overhear someone calling rape “non-consensual sex.” It’s not sex at all. It’s rape. And I know it’s considered “a dirty word” so people don’t like to talk about rape, but GUESS WHAT? Rape happens, it’s very real! So we should be making people more aware about how wrong it is instead of pretending it’s not even a word. #rapevictim #rapesurvivor #starttheconversation #metoo

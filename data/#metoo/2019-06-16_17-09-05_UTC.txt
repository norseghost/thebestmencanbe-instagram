An impression of Art Basel - such diversity in terms of EVERYTHING! Such beautiful arrangements, interesting stories, dreamy paintings, intriguing sculptures and thought provoking writings (the #metoo story board just blew me away and was so eye opening!). I loved to see where the galleries were from an New York, LA and Berlin seemed to be the TOP three from what I could tell.

With two huge halls there was just too much to see and experience though- and after about 5 hrs our legs were begging for a break! But we got our steps in and enjoyed a quick bite at one of the nice food trucks! .

I love this sticker.

I see it as both a call to action against career abusers like Ailes and Weinstein, but also as a simpler comment on opening up about how we communicate to each other about sexual behavior.

I'm grateful to live in a time and place where sex isn't as morally taboo as it was for most of history. There's a vocabulary for it now, and a way to identify welcome behavior from unwanted. It takes out the guesswork. 
I've wondered where we might be if schools taught consent with as much focus as they do cursive.

Consent is an unmistakable, enthusiastic, freely given affirmation to participate in sexual activity. It can be reversed, and is specific to certain actions. 
The point being, talk to your partner! Make sure they're comfortable with what's going on. If you sense there's something wrong, check in.

I do a lot of travelling dinner shows and in rural areas I've heard many a Boomer say a racy joke and sarcastically cry, "Ugh, I can't say that since we're in the #MeToo generation now!" I mean...respect has always been a positive quality. Consideration has never been something to frown on. Understanding how your actions might make someone uncomfortable is just part of being in a functioning community.

I feel like #MeToo is understanding that abuse is way more common than people thought.

I should know. I've experienced it.

I've had time and made peace with it now, and I feel it's something important that I don't mind sharing. If only to make someone feel less alone.

But I also know that it's a highly nuanced issue. There are degrees of intensity and patterns of behavior. There's intentions behind actions, and each person's unique set of circumstances which made them their present selves.

But you know what? We're finally talking about it.

And that's the best part.

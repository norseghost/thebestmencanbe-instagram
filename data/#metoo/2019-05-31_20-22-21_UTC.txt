84% of indigenous women have experienced physical, sexual or psychological violence in their lifetime. In 2016, 5,712 indigenous women and girls were reported missing, but only 116 were logged by the U.S. Department of Justiceâ€™s federal missing persons database. Finally, the federal government is beginning to pay attention with the passing of the Not Invisible Act of 2019, which creates a committee to combat this violence.

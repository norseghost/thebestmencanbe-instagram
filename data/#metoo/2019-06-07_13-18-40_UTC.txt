“Na China, um vídeo viral desencadeia um desafio para a cultura do estupro”, é a matéria em destaque no site do The New York Times.

As imagens foram feitas para exonerar Richard Liu, o magnata do e-commerce.

Eles também ajudaram a alimentar um movimento nascente de #NoPerfectVictim .

Confira abaixo a transcrição de um trecho desta matéria: .
Richard Liu, the Chinese e-commerce billionaire, walked into an apartment building around 10 p.m., a young woman on his arm and his assistant in tow. Leaving the assistant behind, the young woman took Mr. Liu to an elevator. Then, she showed him into her apartment.

His entrance was captured by the apartment building’s surveillance cameras and wound up on the Chinese internet. Titled “Proof of a Gold Digger Trap?,” the heavily edited video aimed to show that the young woman was inviting him up for sex — and that he was therefore innocent of her rape allegations against him.

For many people in China, it worked. Online public opinion quickly dismissed her allegations. In a country where discussion of rape has been muted and the #MeToo movement has been held back by cultural mores and government censorship, that could have been the end of the story.

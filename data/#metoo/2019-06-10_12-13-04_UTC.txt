You are not alone. Sometimes our struggles make us feel invisible, alone and helpless; but nothing could be farther from the truth.

Sharing our battles is hard. Explaining our scars, both physical and emotional, is frightening. It requires us putting ourselves out there and hoping someone validates us. Shame makes us feel like we’re the only ones suffering - and you know what? It’s a lie. Can anyone say #metoo?

You are not alone. You have people around you that have been there, that can help and give perspective. There are trained professionals that you can talk to that will help you find a way out. You are not alone. You are enough. You are loved.

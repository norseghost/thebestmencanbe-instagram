“Courage is grace under pressure,” said Ernest Hemmingway, the great journalist and war correspondent who witnessed young men becoming heroes on the battlefields and frontlines of World War II. As a descendant of one of the brave young men who turned the tide of the war in the greatest battle known to man – D-Day Invasion at Normandy Beach on June 6, 1944, I join America in celebrating the 75th anniversary of D-Day today. My Grandfather, Ysidro P. Betancourt, 2nd Battalion Army Ranger on Omaha Beach, was one of 90 survivors out of 225, who crossed enemy lines in the early hours of the morning after going in on a boat hitting the beach of carnage under the crack and fire of cannons and scaled the shear cliffs of Pointe du Hoc to eliminate the enemy and free Europe from the Nazi regime. My Grandpa Sid returned home with two Purple Heart medals. His courage to liberate people from tyranny and rage to survive against the odds lives on in me, pulsing through my bloodline and body. Though, he has passed on, I hear him call me to go in and take down this evil among us now. But this time it is an invisible, pervasive and insidious enemy wreaking havoc on our bodies – in particular the pelvis – the loaded gun raping our boys, girls and young women and men of their lust for life.
This enemy lives among us. And, we keep silent. We turn a blind eye. But, the pelvis doesn’t lie. It holds the crime scene. I detect the aftermath of these violations and shame in the pelvis of children, boys and girls, men and women, fathers and mothers. These sexual violations and moral injuries to the body masquerade as the slew of puzzling diagnoses that plague our nation in pain. The wounded pelvis triggers the trauma posture that I so often see driving chronic pain, autoimmune disorders, addiction, painful sex, inability to maintain healthy relationships, and disorders such as ADHD, bi-polar and OCD. The pelvis tucks inward to contain the secret and protect itself sealing off the life force in the body, while predators run free to inflict and spread more pain. 
Keeping these violations a secret ensures that someone else in your family will fall victim to it.

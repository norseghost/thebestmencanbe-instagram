Reports show that the majority of rape survivors know their perpetrators. In fact, a report shared by the National Institute of Justice showed that : ‘About 85 to 90 per cent of sexual assaults reported by college women are perpetrated by someone known to the victim; about half occur on a date.’ There a notion/myth that rapists are these strong, criminal looking men or women who take advantage of their victims and cause extreme physical harm. While this may happen in a number of reported cases, a large number of rapists are normal looking men and women who are known by their victims. Rapists do not go around walking with a general stereotype, they can be anyone your father, your aunt, cousin, workmate, worship leader, nduthi guy etc.

Happy Pride Month to all my LGBTQ+ friends and followers. May we continue to try to create a society that is more accepting and open to those of all genders and sexual orientations. Homosexuality IS natural and occurring. Gender is a social construct. Sex and gender should not be conflated. Oh, and love is love is love is love. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜

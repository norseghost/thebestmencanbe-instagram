Englanninkielinen Yle uutisoi #MinäMyösSynnyttäjänä-kampanjan hedelmistä: "'Women should not be coerced, harmed, left feeling helpless or denied help. They are entitled to participate, self-determination and access to information,' Bildjuschkin explained. She added that research into women's treatment in the delivery room needs to be approached from several dimensions. 'Historical aspects, birth experience satisfaction, real risks to the health of the mother or foetus as well as the mother's participation in childbirth. If our mothers are saying that this doesn't feel good, then of course we need to pay close attention. It's time to look into the root causes.'" Ruutukaappaus: yle.fi @yle.news @yleuutiset

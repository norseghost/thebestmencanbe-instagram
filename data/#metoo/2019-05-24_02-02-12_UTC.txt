#14 they also have trouble admitting their mistakes. #6 on here my Moms bf who raped me and abused me for 7 years, He would go around telling people that When he was 16-24 that he was a #underground #merchantmarine and that he served a president in #elsavador and had to kill about 800 + men, women & children... I never truly believed him but, He did cause me to live in even more fear. Because to me, although I already knew he was #evil I felt anyone who could make up a story like that, is capable of anything else other than rape/abuse....Now, That I am away from him and not #brainwashed anymore...I literally #laugh because it's like #WOW but, see... that is what #narcissist do. They #lie all the time. #ptsd #sexualassault #rapesurvivor #abusesurvivor #metoo #nomore #gethelp #mentalhealthawareness #arrogant #irresponsible #mean #survivingsatan

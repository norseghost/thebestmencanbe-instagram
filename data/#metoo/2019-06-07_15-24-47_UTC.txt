Second such article in less than a month about the extreme levels of violence against women in Honduras. A womanâ€™s body is an opportunity for ownership, with the same body violated and discarded when it no longer serves purpose. Leaving is the only option because staying means death. We have #metoo here in US that has seen many powerful men be sentenced for their crimes, but in politically corrupt countries there is little justice for the little girls and women who are violated and broken. @jillfilipovic (@politico) wrote it so much more eloquently. .

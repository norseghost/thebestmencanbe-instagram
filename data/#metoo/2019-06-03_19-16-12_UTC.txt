Sometimes people go through tough times. And I've learned that negative people around you make you negative. We shouldn't be influence so much by our surroundings, but we care and love these people so much we absorb their negativity and drain our energy stores, lowering our coherence and resilience. After a very stressful, difficult and exhausting few months, I've noticed still unfortunately, no matter what you're personally going through, there are still selfish people out there, making your tough times even tougher.

I guess what I wanted to say was fuck them. Fuck their negativity. Fuck their selfishness. And I'm not letting anyone rain on my parade, now I'm trying to get back into my routine I had at the start of the year before my personal trauma.

And guess what? I fucking feel good. I don't need them. Fuck them. 🖕 🦁🧡👊 #metoo #fuckyou #pride #redhead #selfie #gymselfie #stress #mentalhealth #health #wellbeing #mind #spirit #positivity #mondaymotivation

I come as one. I stand as 10,000. The sisterhood has become such an incessant focus in my life, especially since we started to open up to each other after the #metoo movement began. Women and those that identify as such are mobilizing now more than ever and I am so proud that I feel like I’ve been baking a music meal in the kitchen for years that y’all are ready to EAT! We’ve had more sisters showing up at our gigs than ever before and I AM HERE FOR IT. Let’s keep sharing, connecting and telling each other our stories. Ladies, you give me strength to ROAR! 🦁

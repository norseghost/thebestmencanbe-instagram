CANNES 2019 | Nina Wu, Midi Z

Jordanâ€™s opinion: Nina (Wu Ke-Xi), a young Taiwanese actress, hopes to land the role that will launch her career. But how far is she willing to go to achieve her dream?
In line with the #MeToo movement, Midi Z takes us into the worst side of the movie industry. But in a soul-crushing world where glory comes with a price, Nina perseveres and keeps on fighting. We follow her on shootings, in her daily life, in her dreams and her nightmares, prey to a biased, irrational and crazy reality. Still Nina resists and moves beyond the scandal to write the story of a struggle.

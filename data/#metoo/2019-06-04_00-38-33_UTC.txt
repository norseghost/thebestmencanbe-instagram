The desires of this world are fleeting. Things that make us feel good never satisfy us. Not a relationship, not money, not a job, and not material things. The only thing that truly fills us with satisfaction is God's word. The more we allow His word to grow deep roots within our hearts, the less we need any recognition or validation from anyone else. The less we will worry about what may happen, the less we will fear about the future, and the less we will covet what others have that we don't have. I encourage you my friends, fill yourself with His word, that is better than honey from a honey comb, for it satisfies our souls deeper than anything in this world ever could.

This is a very heartbreaking post but I am standing with my friend in bravery and courage. You can read about her story on her Instagram, I have her tagged below. She and her employees resigned from I Love Juice Bar’s Turkey Creek location in Knoxville TN because they were assaulted and threatened by the new management. Unfortunately corporate did nothing. The new management is still there and also owns another location in Knoxville and the employees were “terminated”. Too many times this situation happens and we think the fight is not warranted. Side note...I, more than most, understand that this happens to males as well and I wish people would see this more as a humanity problem and not just a gender issue.

Employees should never be threatened, harassed, or be put in a position where they do not receive pay. (In the state of TN, an employer can withhold your last paycheck for 21 days if you are terminated.) Today, I am standing with Ashley and against Juice Bar as a company. Shame on Juice Bar for not addressing this issue and for not creating a safe culture for their previous, current, and future employees.

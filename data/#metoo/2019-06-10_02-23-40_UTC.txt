So excited for my first thigh piece- done by the awesome Sara at @moonlighttattooseattle today during the flash event to benefit the King County Sexual Assault Resource Center! They didn’t have time today but I’ll be going back to add the matching GRRRL banner on my left thigh! Riot Grrrl was a 90s female punk band/movement, from Washington, that helped spur on the intersectional feminism third wave of the feminist movement 🙌🏻 #riot #riotgrrrl #feminism #metoo #riseupandshout

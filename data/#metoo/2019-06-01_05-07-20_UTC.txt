Bright Star School’s Launch to College teaches our rising graduates the social skills they’ll need to navigate the next phase of their lives.  Combatting sexual assault, abuse, harassment, antiquated gender norms, and toxic shame requires us speak honestly and openly with our young men and women about boundaries, sex, and healthy relationships.  We’d love to include you in the conversation.  #metoo #metoomovement #timesup #toxicrelationships #socialemotionallearning #schoolsafety #selfdefense #lifeskills #collegeready #financialliteracy

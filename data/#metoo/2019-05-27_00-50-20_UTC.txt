‚ÄúIf it couldn't see that the girl just wants to be left alone with Marx and Engels for a while‚Äù üì∫‚úçÔ∏è #TVconcept #scriptidea .

I would love for #JoeFlaherty to play this role, but I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs in retirement. This character is purely fictitious.

Lecturer Lorne Mackenzie wasn‚Äôt well liked, but kept his job because he was a colorful columnist at the New York Spectator (NYS). He wanted to be called Lorne, but most people called him Mac, which he hated since it sounded less English & more Scot or Irish of a low birth. Lorne really didn‚Äôt have to work since his family was part of the clubby elite in Canada, but was goaded into taking a news job in ‚Äúthe States‚Äù after a drunken friend accused him of cowering in the safety of being a big fish in a small pond.

If you were to characterize Mac, he‚Äôs the guy always rooting against the underdog. He had a masters in economics and was decidedly stuck in 1990, espousing the same neoliberal fauxconomics with so much cut and paste. He thought of himself as a Renaissance man, now commenting on things in which he had scant expertise (politics, society, & culture), but his Boomer common sense shtick played to a specific audience. Canada was easy, but New York was merciless and his sloppy punditry was roundly ridiculed by peers in journalism & academe.

His students nicknamed him Zissou & was known for his out-of-touch takes on things. He had a dartboard with Malcolm Gladwell on it & his office was disheveled & unkempt. The College kept him on because of his ties to the NYS, but the rumor was he went from office to office to avoid people and work at both places.

Caitlyn ran a podcast at the College and despised Mac. She was having lunch with her parents at Le Bilboquet in Midtown & saw Mac having lunch with the journalistic disavowed: Charlie Rose & Matt Lauer. ‚ÄúOMG, this is like the Merchants of Death scene in ‚ÄòThank You for Smoking!‚Äô‚Äù She pitched doing an expos√© on Mac as possibly a sexual harasser. Surely, a guy full of himself reeking of privilege with a vaguely misogynistic tone on social media must have some #metoo skeletons in his closet. Alex, the digital editor listened patiently to the pitch...

Itâ€™s estimated that between 40-50% of marriages in the U.K. and US end in divorce.... WOW ðŸ˜®

Iâ€™ve heard lots of women speaking to themselves very negatively about being divorced - and Iâ€™ve also heard the judgement towards divorced women. ðŸ‘‰ Many women are ashamed that they couldnâ€™t make a marriage work
ðŸ‘‰ Some women think people will think they werenâ€™t a good enough wife, which feels embarrassing
ðŸ‘‰ Some people say nasty stupid things, like they would never date a divorced woman
ðŸ‘‰ People say divorced women have too much â€˜baggageâ€™

Divorce is usually not taken lightly by those invoked. Frankly, I think itâ€™s a bloody miracle if you manage to stay deeply in love and perfectly matched to the same person you married 10+ years ago.

We all evolve, grow and change as life goes on. Divorce is simply the end of something that once worked, but now doesnâ€™t for whatever reasons. Live the truth, love is not always forever ðŸ–¤

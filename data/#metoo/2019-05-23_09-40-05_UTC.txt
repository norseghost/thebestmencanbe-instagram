"I thought the workshop was well thought out, engaging, and heavily researched. Matt and Liz were both passionate about the topic and gave us so many great resources and references to learn more on our own, while also equipping us with useful graphics/research to take back to our companies. I also loved the space and the openness you felt with within the group to share intimate experiences. Learning from others who are as passionate about diversity and inclusion work as me, if not more so, is always inspiring and makes me that much more motivated to lead the change I wish to see in my organization as well as my daily life." -Allies & Advocates Workshop Participant

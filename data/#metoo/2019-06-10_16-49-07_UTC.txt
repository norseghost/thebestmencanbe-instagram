meat eater: where do you even get your protein?!
vegetarian/vegan: why do you care where i get my protein?!
love the impact we have made! this is in no way hating on non-veg people, a few keep us balanced, but to many isn't okay. this is to show being vegetarian and vegan is okay and even good for the ecosystem. stop hating on veg eaters and supply more veg options and restaurants and fast food!! we want to eat too!!ðŸ’žðŸŒ±~ðŸ§¡

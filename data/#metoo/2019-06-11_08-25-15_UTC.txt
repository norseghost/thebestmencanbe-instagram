â€˜Words are important- to fight silence, alienation, and violence. Words are flags planted on the planets of our beings; they say this is mine, I have fought for it and despite your attempts to silence me, I am still here. Just as important, words help us find each other and overcome isolation that threatens to overwhelm and to break us. Words say we are here.â€™ - Mona Eltahawy

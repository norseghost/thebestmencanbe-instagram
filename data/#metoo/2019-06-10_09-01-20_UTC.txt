Amrita Sher-Gil, who has been called the “Frida Kahlo of India” for her vibrant mashup of Eastern and Western styles, lived an all-too-brief but fascinating life.
Born in Budapest in 1913, she was the daughter of a Hungarian-Jewish opera singer and a Jat Sikh aristocrat scholar. Her early childhood was privileged, and she received formal painting lessons until financial disaster struck the family and led them to return to India. There, she blossomed artistically, finding inspiration country’s people, subjects that would earn her a reputation as a pioneer of Modernism.

In her lifestyle, Sher-Gil was wholly unconventional. As a child, she was expelled from school for declaring herself an atheist. She engaged in numerous affairs with both men and women, married her Hungarian first cousin, supported Gandhi’s politics despite her family’s ties to the British Raj, and even entertained an intimate friendship with the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru—whom she refused to paint on the grounds that he was too handsome. (Her father burned their letters, so the extent of their relationship is lost to history). At 28, just days from the opening of her first major solo show, she fell into a sudden coma and died soon after. Though the facts are uncertain, it is believed that she succumbed to an infection after a failed abortion.

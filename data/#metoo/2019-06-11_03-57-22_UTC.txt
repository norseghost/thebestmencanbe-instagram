I often experience random fits of guilt, whether it is over a specific event or an assaultive meltdown I had when I was twenty or from bumping into a wall and worrying that I hurt the wall's feelings... It becomes very overwhelming at times and it often enters a point where I cannot think about anything else and I become convinced that I am a horrible and disgusting and dirty person... This becomes shame and shame is the stickiest and most unbearable emotion... ---Hannnah... #guiltcomplex #mentalillnessawareness #actuallyautistic #autismacceptance #autismawareness #mentalhealthawareness #depression #shame #ptsd #trauma #metoo

The other evening Max and I were talking and the topic of sexual harassment somehow got brought up (I think we were talking about something in the news) - anyway I ended up explaining to him that I didn't think I had any female friends who had not experienced some form of sexual harassment at some point in their lives. He was completely shocked. And while I knew that he and his close friends have always been the type of guy who are extremely respectful of #women it made me realize that the degree to which women have been harassed and abused is still -in this modern era- not well understood or acknowledged. So much is being done now it's true- HUGE progress; the #metoo movement etc. but this conversation reminded me how much work we still have. It is also strongly tied to the current #abortion rights debacle. Regardless of where you stand politically or religiously, the act of regulating women's full rights to making decisions about what happens with their bodies is inherently and unequivocally tied to thousands of years of #sexualharassment and debasement of women. Every women to and of and for herself ‚úäüôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è
And thank god and grace for the incredible men who are helping hold the torch and loving us deeply, such as my fianc√© ‚òÄÔ∏è

A song for my fellow sexual assault survivors. A sexual assault deeply affects your life and the way you comprehend the world. But you’re stronger than you think you know, you’re loved so much more than you can imagine. It is so important that we speak openly about this topic to help people understand that they are not alone in this world. It’s not your fault, you weren’t asking for it, it had nothing to do with your clothes, it’s YOUR body 💕

This is by far the most personal song I’ve ever written. I was never ready enough before to speak openly about these issues. But music can heal and writing this song has been very cathartic to me ❤️ If you would like to see a video about sexual assault to gain some more insight on how you can help someone who’s dealing with it I can totally do that! 🌟 -

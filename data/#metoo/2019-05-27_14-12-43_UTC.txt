Blower’s Daughter (II/II)
Everything about this song smells of lingering nostalgia somehow. The melody weeps, the lyrics caress and the song lifts. 
But beyond the philosophy, being able to sing this song without step downs feels like an achievement to me.
So here’s @eternalramblings’ and my cover of this beautiful song by @damienrice, this man is divine, for sure.
Our coordination with the background is purely coincidental :P

Head over to @eternalramblings for part I/II 
And if you like it, do share 😁

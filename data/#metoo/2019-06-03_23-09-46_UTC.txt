confession. i took a little break from my sexual assault awareness film project as i was going through some things that required my attention and i was having more flashbacks. which, makes sense given this project is very heavy and it can be taxing on me. it’s going to take longer than i wanted to get done but i don’t think it should be rushed either. especially when i need to make sure i’m taking care of myself too. i’m still not ready to share my stories, but one day i will. it wasn’t my fault, even on bad days when i think maybe it was, it’s not.⁣⁣

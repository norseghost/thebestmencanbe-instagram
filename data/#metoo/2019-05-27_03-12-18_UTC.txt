Airplane #reading. Possibly my favorite Alisha Rai to date? I truly love seeing current events in my #romance (#metoo, CTE in football, 2nd CTE this year: see Fumbled by Martin). I borrowed the NYT from my neighbor (with whom I also talked libraries and book clubs!) and it was on fire today. @stella_jay Pic 2 is for you. @linzer_ann Pic 6 is for you. Pic 3 is for @librarianguish (and me, due to mind meld). Pic 4 made me laugh. Consequences indeed! Pic 5 is missing a key word at the end there: Prodigy. I promise I'll get a new phone soon that doesn't blur everything. ðŸ˜¢#bookstagram #amreading #newspaper #romancenovels #librariansofinstagram

@hannah_gadsby has provided me with this motto for my own reclamation of my body as like her, I spent much of my life as an undiagnosed autistic girl and women and have been abused and assaulted by men many times... She is so beautiful and magical and her comedy is revolutionary, in its finale and in its triumph, in the recognition that a joke never resolves and without resolution, the truth of an experience is lost... I love how she is able to weave her special interest into her comedy, how she teaches us about art history and mental health and LGBT Culture and what it is like to be a broken woman at the same time that she makes us laugh... Comediens, like tragedicians, are those that conjure an immediacy and urgency of expression, that use tension as Gadsby describes, to pull the emotional strings of an audience and Gadsby does this beautifully... She is able to make us laugh and weep at the same time... ---Hannnah... #hannahgadsby #actuallyautistic #metoo #autismacceptance #autismawareness #autisticbrilliance #autisticgirls #femaleautism #latediagnosedalwaysautistic

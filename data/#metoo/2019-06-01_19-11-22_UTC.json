I can say what ever I want!\u201d Listen, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find anyone in this country who *doesnt* believe in free speech. \nBut...I just can\u2019t shake this crazy notion I have that the founding fathers had something different in mind. I just can\u2019t shake the idea that the intent of the first amendment WAS NOT to give people the right to act like assholes, any more than the intent of the Second Amendment was to condone murder. \nThe free speech primal scream in the 21st century democratic-but-currently-heavily-divided United States sounds like an excuse for bad behavior. Yup. Like the college freshman that makes an asshole of herself at the frat party and writes it off as intoxication. (And yeah, yeah, I\u2019ve been that girl once or twice before.) But it\u2019s not something I strive for. And neither should you. \nAnd as a mom...I\u2019m totally blown away by the fear and confusion of this message we are passing down to our children, consciously and subconsciously. \nShare your toys. Be nice. Love thy neighbor. And if someone disagrees with you, remind that idiot that in this country we can say whatever harmful, hurtful thing we want. \nAnd wanna know the kicker? These are THE SAME parents who organize school events to remind kids to \u201cEmbrace kindness\u201d and \u201cBuild Bridges\u201d and \u201cSupport Your Favorite Charity.\u201d These are THE SAME people who will block anyone on social media who says something they don\u2019t like. THE SAME people who whisper and nudge in secret, conspiratorial-esque groups and accuse *everyone*\ud83d\udc4f *else*\ud83d\udc4f of prejudice and racism and bigotry. \nSo how about we try something different: How about we use that rallying \u201cFree Speech!\u201d cry ONLY when someone else needs help having their voice be heard?  What if we were to remind ourselves \u2014 with our inside voice \u2014 that my right to free speech is equal to yours. Could we try to remember that different or conflicting opinions falls within the boundaries of free speech \u2014 \nEven. If. You. Don\u2019t. Like. What. They. Say. \nP.S. Happy Pride Day! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99"

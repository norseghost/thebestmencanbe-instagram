The owner released a video statement saying he is "committed to avoiding future animal suffering", but repeated rape, separation of mother & babies, and murder are a part of the business😑🗑The only way to end this is to STOP PAYING FOR IT.

@worldanimalnews_ - (SWIPE 👈 LEFT) As WAN previously reported today, the largest undercover #dairy investigation in history is being released with video evidence documenting systemic and illegal abuse at @FairOaksFarms in FairOaks, Indiana. 🐄💔
-
#FairOaksFarms is one of the largest dairies in the U.S. and produces dairy products for the @Fairlife milk brand - which is produced, marketed and distributed by the @CocaCola Corporation.
-
Undercover investigators from @ARMinvestigations confirmed abuse virtually on a daily basis and that male calves are in fact transported to veal farms (Midwest Veal and Calf Start), despite the corporation's claims that it does not.
-
ARM calls on the CocaCola Corporation, which claims to have a progressive stance on animalwelfare, to end their relationship with Fairlife Corporation and cut their ties with the veal industry.🙏

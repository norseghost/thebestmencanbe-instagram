Jai ma. Sometimes concepts and memes, and institutions, and universes, just need to die so that real love can be reborn. The wrathful mother uses tough love to kill the abberated ego, off in its own delight land of addiction to freedom. Freedom in commitment, liberation in surrender, absolute in relative, delight in overcoming disgust. Facing fears is not pleasant. Stop pretending it is.

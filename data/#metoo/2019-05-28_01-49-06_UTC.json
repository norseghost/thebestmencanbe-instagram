                        "text": "7 years ago today I left my husband, the father of my kids and the only life I\u2019d ever known. I needed an AVO and police intervention after years of domestic violence including verbal and physical abuse. When I left him I luckily had a lot of support around me but I had zero self esteem and had no idea how I would manage life as a single mum after being with him since I was 15.\n\nIn the last 7 years I have been raising 5 kids by myself and doing a pretty good job. They\u2019re all good kids and I take all the credit for it.\nI\u2019ve taken them to the snow, on several cruises, on their 1st overseas trip and across NSW camping and fourbying. We\u2019re roadtripping to Uluru in a few months too!\nI go to school events, footy games, netball carnivals, take them moto riding and love them fiercely.\nI got divorced, finalised property settlement, worked my ass off and sacrificed a lot to buy my exhusband out and keep the house to give my children security and stability. I then renovated the house, sold the house and moved down the coast in search of a better life for us. We found it. It\u2019s gorgeous down here.\nI bought a block of land and moved into our brand new house 12 months ago.\nI\u2019ve graduated Uni with a Bachelor of Community Development and currently at Uni studying Law to maintain my employability and ensure our futures.\nI self published a book on my DV experience, sold copies around the world and about to start collaborating with a company who shares my vision.\nI\u2019ve lost 5 kilos, worked on me and my healing and gained self confidence and self esteem I never imagined I\u2019d ever have. I\u2019ve learned to love who I am, flaws and all, and so damn excited for what the future holds.\nI\u2019ve never been happier \u2764\ufe0f"

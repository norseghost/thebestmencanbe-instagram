They say the first step to adulthood is graduation, that being said I’m still just a kid who’s afraid of the dark.

Thank you to everyone who made my high school career a success.

My Parents who always pushed me to achieve great things, whether it was in basketball, school, or work.

My sista who always helped me in homework out of the kindness of her heart, or cause I made her.

The Boys who always got my back no matter what.

The Ballers who motivated me to be better in basketball. 
The Friends I have met along the way that I am so happy were apart of my high school life.

And above all, the biggest thanks goes to the Man upstairs.

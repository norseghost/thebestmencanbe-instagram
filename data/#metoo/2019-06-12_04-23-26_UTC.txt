A few days after the breakup, they’re posting pictures with someone else. Someone you’ve never seen before. They make no effort to hide their latest conquest. In fact, it feels like they’re showing the new target off. They feel no embarrassment and no guilt. You know it’s a bad idea, but your curiosity gets the best of you. You start peeking around, discovering that this new person has been interacting with your ex for a while now.

Find a comfortable place to sit.  A place where there is silence.  No distractions.  Get comfy.  Relax your shoulders.  Unclench your jaw. Take a deep breath in.  Hold.  Slowly exhale.  Close your eyes.  Turn off your brain (this can sometimes take work). Listen to your heart. .

What is your heart telling you?  What does your heart - not your mind, your heart - what does it want?  What does it feel?  What does it yearn for?  What makes it content? Healthy? Happy?

Take a deep breath.  Hold.  Slowly exhale.  Repeat.  Slowly open your eyes.  Write down the answers to the above prompts.  Now, make plans and set goals to make this a reality.

If it looks like I’m about to cry— #accurate. ⁣

Tears of joy though. I’m still amazed by the little things I find I’m able to do with my “new ACL”, like 70# RFESS. 😃⁣
⁣
And Nordic Hamstring Curls. ⁣
⁣
And 9.5 mph sprints on a 7.5 incline. ⁣
⁣
Baby steps to the Brute Force Mile, trail running, and ski season (and also 5 o’clock) but whole-heartedly enjoying the recovery process! ⁣
⁣
...Maybe not so much the knee aches from the extra stairs in our new house. 👵🏻 ⁣
⁣
Yesterday’s aforementioned exercise clips are up in my stories. If you think my face looks miserable here, wait till you see those Nordic ham curls. 🤪⁣

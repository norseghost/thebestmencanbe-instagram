Women Rights are Human Rights 
We All women's want respect, Freedom to live our lives . To go where ever we want to. Without any intimidation Or harassment . 
Let's discuss some general issues of this society 
1.

WomenÂ are just not good at driving a car (or at least, thatâ€™s how the stereotype goes). An extensiveÂ BBC researchÂ suggests that womenâ€™s â€˜lack of hormonesâ€™ could be a strong reason why they are able to judge the road with more accuracy than men

Ahh I didn't mean to say that mens are not good at Driving. Everyone needs to become a better driver. But please stop judging 
Because it happens with me alot of time 
Larki ??? Gari challa rahi hain deekho deekho ... Agar challani nahi ati tou ground ma jao. Fazul ma peechay sa horn  karna ... batamizi ka sath overtake karna .. etc 
2. 
Verbal and physical harassment of women is common on Pakistanâ€™s streets, with little recourse for victims.

My friend  was going to her coaching . A men on a motorbike coming from behind slowed his bike near her grabbed her Hips and ran away it happens in a second . What the hell ??? Tummara ghar ma maa bhen nahi hain ???? In Saab ka blame last ma os larki ko Diya gaya jeans pheni thi tumna OMG .. phir tou yehi hota hain .. Baji hum tou Apni beti  ko Abaye ma bhejtay hain coaching .. fazul ma loogo ko battay bana ati hain .
Jeans pheni thi koi short skirt thori tha . 
Larki ho chup raho bhai ka samna .. Abbu ka samna.. husband ka samna .. chup raho larki ho sharam nahi ati ???? ðŸ˜‘

Yeah obviously it happens with me . You should be confident in the way you are what ever you are wearing.. koi kuch bolta hain na bolna dou kutto ka kaam hain bhookna .. koi kuch karta hain tou cheeko !! Maro peeto Duniya ka nahi soochna ka loog Kiya khaygay .. Rukna Nahi aj rukgai tu samaj Lou haar gaye hum !!! RESPECT WOMEN they can be your mother, sister or wife

                        "text": "#triggerwarning for rape & sexual assault. This is a cute take on a sadly deadly serious subject. Supposedly men are super nervous about being called out because of #metoo #metoomovement .They fear false accusations, young men\u2019s \u201clives will be ruined\u201d with zero regard to the women that survive their assaults. Even other women will defend bad actors because they like them or are related to them. Some suggest that only eight to ten percent of women report their rapes to the police, leaving at least ninety percent of rapes unreported. False accusation fearmongers stir the pot. But something no one considers. While an estimated two to eight percent of sexual assaults or rapes are falsely reported, this number only affects the number of REPORTED rapes; therefore, the amount of false reports in comparison to the total number of sexual assaults and rapes is likely closer to .002 to .008%. Statistically, it is overwhelmingly more likely that a person alleging sexual assault or rape is telling the truth than making a false accusation. Youngblood\u2019s, it\u2019s not rocket science, be respectful, be courteous, unambiguously consensual sex is amazing. And, if you\u2019re not sure you have consent? You DON\u2019T. Stand down. Ive already stared conversations about consent with both of my kids. Unfortunately, America\u2019s fear of talking about Sex leaves many ignorant. Realize the unique risk for women and be sensitive to it. It\u2019s not a game. It\u2019s not about you feeling rejected or lead on. Fuck your feelings. At any time, she can change her mind. So can you. \u201cWhy do men feel threatened by women?\u201d . . . \u201cThey\u2019re afraid women will laugh at them.\u201d . . . \u201cWhy do women feel threatened by men?\u201d . . . \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of being killed.\u201d Second Words: Selected Critical Prose, 1960\u20131982, Margaret Atwood.  #beliveher #consentissexy #consentalways #letstalkaboutconsent"

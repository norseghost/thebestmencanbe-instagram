To all the obsessive ex - anything's--
To all the toxic people who were finally cut off but still feel the need to force themselves and their ideals into the other person's life.

YOU SHOULD NOT need multiple rejections, reminders and legal contracts to stop contacting, harassing, manipulating and threatening someone you are angry, jealous, envious, and/or obsessed with. 
__
You. Are. Not. Entitled. To. Shit. 
You are entitled to absolutely NOTHING of the people you've hurt.

My life, her life, his life, their life, IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS EVER AGAIN.

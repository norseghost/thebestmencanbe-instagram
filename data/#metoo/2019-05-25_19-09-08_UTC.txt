Let’s do something different today ~ let’s work on believing in ourselves.
.

I know you are a perfectionist who thinks things need to be “just so” and that you are quick to find faults in yourself. .

What would happen if we realized that we all have faults and things cannot always be “just so”? What if we had the same rules for ourselves that we did for our best friend?  What if believing in ourselves, just as we are, was the prescription we needed to begin being happy, content, and fulfilled?
.
One way to do so today is to look in the mirror and smile at yourself.  Or, write down 5 nice things about yourself.  Try one of these today ~ and do it again tomorrow and the next day.  Let’s start believing in ourselves 💙🦋💙

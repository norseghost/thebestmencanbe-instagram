Print by Alexis Lampley for @creativeactionnetwork's campaign with @WorkingFamilies. On May 25, 2007, President George W. Bush signed into law the Fair Minimum Wage Act, which gradually raised the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour. It was the LAST time that the federal minimum wage was raised. Use this anniversary to talk about the need to change this to create economic opportunity for more Americans through a liveable wage. Cite the values of Economic Security and Community. #FightFor15 #LivingWage #MinimumWage #MeTooMcdonalds #metoo #timesup #activist #econopp4all #lowpay #wagegap #worklife #womenwhowork #wendys #unionsforall #workerpower #workersrights #laborrights #humanrights #fairpay #wagetheft

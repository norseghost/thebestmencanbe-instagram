#KorraObidiDean is Unapologetically living life on her terns and we're #InspiredbyHer. Korra's life goal is to create a 'shift in her people' and she's putting her actions where her words are!

From moving to shangai (where she met the love of her life), to going to L.A (together) to follow her dreams, @korraobidi isn't letting anything stop her... not even pregnancy.

She Auditioned for a spot on #soyouthinkyoucandance and though she didn't go beyond the auditions, she left an impression that will last a very long time.

Korra is happening to life, an epitome of "The world makes way for the (wo)man who knows where (s)he is going... and we're here for it! 😍

P.S: Shoutout to @drjustindean... a King who supports his Queen. #IStan

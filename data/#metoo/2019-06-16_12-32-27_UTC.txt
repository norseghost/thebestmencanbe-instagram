Happy Fatherâ€™s Day to the dads and stepdads who are actively involved in their childrenâ€™s lives.  And, to the Momâ€™s doing double time and being both mom and dad, I see you and keep doing the great job you are doing.
.
As with Motherâ€™s Day, today can be an emotionally charged day.  To those who have lost their dads, never knew their dads, or are estranged from their dads, I send you lots of love. ðŸ’™

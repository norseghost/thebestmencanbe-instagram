That was the basis the entire company was built on.\n\nWylie has previously told MPs at a British select committee that the EU referendum was won through fraud after Vote Leave allegedly used a network of companies to get round election spending laws. He said he thought there \u201ccould have been a different outcome had there not been, in my view, cheating\u201d. He also met privately with House Democrats in April, but Wednesday\u2019s hearing was his first public appearance before US lawmakers.\n\nOlivia Solon\nThe Guardian\n\n#marketing #trending #profit #political #success #collective #ootd #politics #trending #metoo #timesup #trend #strategy #feminism #finnishgirl #freedom #graphics #future #lifestyle #journalist #journalism #psychology #god #fashion #trendy #hygge #blogger #influencer #business #lgbt #concept"

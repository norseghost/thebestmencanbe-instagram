It repeatedly refers to the events as \u201csexual harassment\u201d rather than \u201csexual assault\u201d\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nYou want to know how I feel about this?\u2063\nWell, \u2063\nFUCK YOU USC and FUCK YOU anonymous op-ed writer\u2063\nYour article and your opinion is bullshit\u2063\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u2063\n\u2063\nHow convenient you use the term \u201charassment\u201d when you very well know it was SEXUAL ASSAULT. While the former is egregious, should never happen in itself, and is an illegal violation of civil rights, the latter is a FELONY. A program that fails to act to protect its trainees from repetitive FELONIES is NOT a program that should be allowed to have trainees. PERIOD.\u2063\n\u2063\nEvery 92 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted. Only 5 out of every 1,000 perpetrators will go to prison (rainn.org). As a Gyn, I have sat and cried with many sexual assault victims - some who I saw soon after, some who told me years after, and some who never told anyone else but me. \u2063\n\u2063\nWomen such as Dr. Meena Zareh, do not want to be heroes, but they are.\u2063\n\u2063\nWE MUST BELIEVE AND PROTECT WOMEN. Why is this so fucking hard to do? And doctors who can\u2019t do this are a special kind of asshole. I am disgusted by this op-ed, disgusted by the responses, and disgusted by USC\u2019s failure to protect women.\u2063\n\u2063\nSo I ask Mr Anonymous, which is worse: the inconvenience of finding another program (which, by the way, is being offered at the same institution) or the very real risk of being sexually assaulted by one of your colleagues??\u2063\n\u2063\n24/7 800.656.HOPE"

I’m caught up 🙌🏼😂💙😍 (and a week late) BUT our BIG boy is 3 months!!! He is the happiest, smiliest baby. He is so spoiled and LOVES to be held ALL.THE.TIME. He is a mommy’s boy for sure. He loves to be talked to and sang to... he loves Eason and Leila’s attention! He so badly wants to sit up and move around! Soon and very soon baby boy! He is only mad when he is hungry or tired #metoo - I think our little roly poly is weighing about 14lbs 😳 where’d my itty preemie go?! 😂 he has started playing on his play mat, he wears 3mo and some 3-6mo clothes, only wakes up once a night (mostly), has big blue eyes like Bubba did, favors sissy’s baby pictures but has a personality all his own! We could love his more or feel more complete! We love you #davisdean #3months #bigboylilbro

@ptiofficial A distraught father goes to the police in Pakistan to report on his missing daughter, but instead is met with hostility by the present police officer because the family is poor. The officer then informs the distraught father that his TEN year old daughter probably eloped. Yes. A police officer said that... and then proceeds to treat the family like the hired help by asking them to clean his office,move furniture, run errands for him, and buy fruit for his Iftar. The officer has since been suspended. The daughter Farishta was abducted, raped and murdered....
That is how you are treated if you are poor in Pakistan....
Truly heartbreaking...ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’” #politics #feminist #feminism #london #blogger #smashpatriarchy #justice #metoo #timesup

You do not have to forgive your abuser to heal. The most important thing is forgiving yourself. Ive been pressured to forgive by so many ignorant people and it makes me sick. If your abuser keeps pressuring you to forgive them then that only shows that they havent forgiven themselves and that is their problem and not yours. .

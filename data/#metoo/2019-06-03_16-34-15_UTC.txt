ðŸ¤”Maybe I shouldnâ€™t even call it â€˜badâ€™ skin.
ðŸ¤­Maybe Iâ€™m just as blinded by the social pressures as everyone else!

When did you last see a big red spot on a moisturiser advert?! Or a blemish on a model in a magazine? Or dark spots on a womanâ€™s face in a music video?

Women are bombarded with highly filtered and perfected faces. Skin smooth, bump free, spot free, glowing, no redness. So thatâ€™s what we are all meant to aspire to yeah??? Ridiculous. Did you know up to 80% of people aged 11-30 will have an acne break out at some point? And who gets that same pimple every time they get their period?

If youâ€™re struggling with your skin, you are not alone. You are not the odd one out. Most of us have problems at least now and again.

Your skin is a wonder really! Think about what it does! Love it, appreciate it. Whatâ€™s really important is much deeper ðŸ–¤

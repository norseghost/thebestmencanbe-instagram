Ms. Song crying over the death of her puppy, Chibi. It happened right after she came back from China, a trip to trace back her memories of “comfort woman” with camera crew. As if Chibi would be waiting for Ms. Song’s back, Chibi died right after her arrival at home. 
During the war time, Japanese military took her to several places in China and forced to be a sex slave for Japanese soldiers. 💠please support our cloud funding to have a photo exhibition “Ms. Song next to us” in July 2019 in Tokyo.

It's been wonderful working with director @calumrobshaw on 'The Carnalval', a one woman show I wrote about 1.5 years ago. It presents women in society, the sexual repression and objectification they endure, in a dark, comedic, cabaret manner. To finally get to perform it in London has been a great feeling and I'm looking forward to riding out the rest of this wave. Thank you @lushcabaret for having me and 'The Carnalval' and to @theburlyphotographer for these shots! Definitely more to come.

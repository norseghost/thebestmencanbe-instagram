I wrote this to a beat made by @melissayork  I heard it once and this song poured out. Produced by me and @rogerpaulmason •

“Easy Target” is about finding your own sense of self-worth, strength and pride in the face of adversity.  Because women are often criticized more intensely and more often than men, this song is about knowing who you are anyway.  Although I wrote this based on my own experiences, I send this out to Anita Hill, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, @taranajaneen , the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, and the countless women who stand up and tell their truth! 📸 by @shervinfoto •

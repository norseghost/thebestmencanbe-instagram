In light of the Andrea Bowers #MeToo debacle at @artbasel, I’m thinking about the #DocNow project, which is about prioritizing ethical practices when working with social media content. They’re thinking through complex issues like how you honor the rights and safety of content-creators, especially when you are creating an archive that might contain thousands of tweets. Andrea Bowers only had to engage one person. “Open Secrets” could have been an amazing artwork—maybe even more interesting and powerful—if Bowers had thought through the ethics of the piece.

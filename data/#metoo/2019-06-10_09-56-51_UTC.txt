STOP RAPING!!! Every day we get to know about a rape case..
It's not about politics. It's not about religion. 
It's not about feminism.  But yes it's about humanity. 
Why my country has such high rape case percentage?  Why men can't control themselves?  For how long do you expect girls to hide themselves?  For how long would you ruin someone's life? 
From an ancient time women have been facing such things.  Even men nowadays are not safe. 
Who are these people that rape? 
We do candle marches and rallies to raise voice against rape.  But the rapists is free. 
Every month there's a new case. 
Isn't it disgusting? 
Recently I saw a girl who said I hate to be an Indian.  And actually a lot of girls say that. 
What is this country giving to us? Where there is a backward thinking of stating men superior and women inferior. 
Still in some places women are considered as an object.  Just raised to look after kids and make kids. 
And in fact women are the reason for all this.  Some women too encourage men to do this all.  For example- you have all heard cases about abortion and etc.  Where elder member of family needs a boy child. 
Women don't support women. 
And in some areas men support women. 
I don't want to say that men are wrong.  I want to say that sensible men can encourage others to stop it.  And women can tackle other women who encourage rape and misuse of girls.

Lies of Men by @dana_killion_author // Reviewed by @cansail for Reedsy Discovery.⠀
⠀
Verdict: ★★★✩✩ — A journalist discovers disturbing intersections between her own past and the story she's investigating, with a surprising twist at the end.⠀
⠀
"The narrator is a journalist/sleuth dealing with men who, at best, are not listening to her; at worst, they are trying to silence her and steal her company. This book could be a fictional tract for the #metoo movement, and every woman is—in one way or another—abused. At times the "message" comes on too strong; fortunately, the story is saved from caricature by a token "baddie" on both sides of the sexist divide."⠀

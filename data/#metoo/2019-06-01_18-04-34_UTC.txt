I've had people say similar comments to me, or ask, "How have you recovered from all the trauma you have been through?" "How have you kept your faith in God in tact?" "How do you get out of bed everyday?" Somedays, I dunno. Somedays I dunno how I go to work everyday, hear other people's trauma and then continue with everyday life. But most of the time I do know. I know that my faith and Gods faithfulness and grace has walked me gently through the pain, confusion and depression and anxiety. Along with renewing my mindset, creating a support network, CHOOSING to do and be better. Many tears have fallen, and continue to fall sometimes daily. But I can do this, and so can you. It comes down to decisions. Big ones, small ones. And doing them afraid. What's on the other side of your fear?

Still a Queen ðŸ‘‘âœŠ.

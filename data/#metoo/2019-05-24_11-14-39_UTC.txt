TILL WHEN IS THIS GONNA END ?⚔️ .
.
Heart throbbed ,
Fingers trembled , ...
Since I came across the news ; 3 years old girl Aiman Zehra  been raped ; sexual harassment inside mandir that too during 'akshey triteya' (such a holy fest) 
and then aunty ultimately blaming female's outfit...
like wow..
can we have a round of applause ??
shit ! Holyshit !

I was thinking , 
We all are living in a country where we can never be exploited at any point of our lives.
We are living in a country obidient to lawful authorities .

We are living in a country where great privileges are provided.
WE EXIST IN THE SAME COUNTRY WHERE  WOMEN ARE THE DEITIES WE PRAY OF !
Then whyyyy ?
I askk whyyyy till now our women are being raped and not a single authority give a damn about it ? 😔
All these incident affected me hard , 
its been a couple of days my brain getting eaten up thinking of all ,
really scared a living daylights out of me !

I knw people out there too are provoked by this monstrous deeds.

So now what if we put this together , resulting in something positive ..☮️
Not every male have similar intentions 
but..
TEACH your brothers , sons , husbands or boy friends , some aspects of human behavioral to resist in this society.
also.. Be a responsible inhabitant of the society , 
by doing something for yourself first.💓 Thank You.

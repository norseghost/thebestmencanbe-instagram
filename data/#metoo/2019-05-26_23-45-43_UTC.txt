Lighthouse In The Night  Alfonsina Storni. â€¢. The sky a black sphere,
the sea a black disk.

The lighthouse opens
its solar fan on the coast.

Spinning endlessly at night,
whom is it searching for

when the mortal heart
looks for me in the chest?

Look at the black rock
where it is nailed down.

A crow digs endlessly
but no longer bleeds. #madwoman #monologue #july #winter #metoo #feminism #melbourneactress #melbournetheatre #melbourne #mexicoðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ #cityofmelbourne #timeout #hangingoutwithfriends #brunswick #carlton @lausacting @butterflyclubmelb

Saw the new Alladin movie. Pretty good! These are lyrics to the only new song, love! Noone can ever beat the original Genie, but if someone has to do it, Will Smith was the right choice. Best part is that they traded the original Jasmine, half dressed and helpless and turned her into a strong, self respecting, powerful woman. 👏👏👏 #alladin #throwback #womenempowerment #womanstrong #girlsrule #willsmith #movies #metoo

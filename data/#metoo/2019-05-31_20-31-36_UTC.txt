I had an enriching, educational, entertaining and evocative evening at “A Word About Consent” last night in Duncan. It was an honour to host this important event, which touched upon the many ways that sexualized violence affects us personally and as a society, and particularly in marginalized groups. I was inspired by all the shared work, the shared stories, and the shared space. Thanks to the Warmland Women’s Support Service Society, the Duncan Showroom and the Department of Justice Canada for making this happen. And check out my sweet consenT-shirt. Nights like these are encouraging. ❤️💪🗺

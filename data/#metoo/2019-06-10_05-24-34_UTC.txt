I am very grateful that on a beautiful day like today, with a heart like crumpled treehouse plans, I just got to paint for a few hours in the company of great humans, with their own crumpled life stuff, or joyful life stuff... and just look real hard at the world, on a wild windy spring day on top of a hill over oaks bottom. #blessthismess @elisabethjonesartcenter thanks for the send out!!! @jolynfry thanks for the healthy indifference (good parenting) @rockstarkate.art thanks for crushing, painting g endurance and straight skills. @melgiusto thanks for the drive by. @radiusartstudio thanks for the community #love #paint #doitoutside #pleinair

W/ my newly assigned job in the Army & someone breaking into my house today & robbing me & my roommate... It’s been a very stressful & emotional week! 😔 Instead of focusing on the bad things that have happened to me these past couple days, I wanted to highlight the positives. | I was able to take a trip down my @disneychannel #memorylane this past Sunday... @alyandaj, y’all have entirely developed into such empowering young women. From their #SanctuaryTour in support of the @trevorproject, #lgbtq community, & #mentalhealthawareness to their song #StarMaps which dives into the #MeToo movement... So awesome to see these two incredibly talented musicians/actresses use their platform to help others. It meant a lot to me, because these causes strike  really close to home w/ me. #WomenEmpowermentWednesday goes out to them... Thank you for providing others w/ a #Sanctuary to celebrate in. 🙌🏽❤️ #WomenEmpowerment #HeForShe #PrideMonth @propeller.la ————————————————
Embraced the tornado warnings & severe thunderstorms, danced in the pouring rain, gave a free ticket to a stranger, invited new friends to hang out w/ Aly, AJ, & me, & was able to spend money towards supporting #TheTrevorProject & moving towards ending conversion therapy, while helping others to embrace their true selves. 🏳️‍🌈 My solo introvert adventures continue to connect me w/ incredible human beings that God has allowed me to cross paths w/. Laura & Vanessa, I’m so glad that you two were able to tag along & join me on #AlyAndAJ’s tour bus. Just wanted to bring some light into someone’s life; I hope I was able to do that for y’all. 😊 (On top of all of this I’m healthy, alive, & my family/friends are doing well... People will always be more important than things.) #ThankYou #PayItForward #loveislove ————————————————

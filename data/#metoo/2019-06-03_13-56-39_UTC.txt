This weeks #seriesoftheweek is the Cubs hosting the Rockies, the two second place teams are fighting for playoff appearances once again. The my are both in tough divisions, but both teams are going to be decided by which bottom of the order will preform well.
•
The Rockies have more depth usually, but they are without Charlie Blackmon for at least a week or so. Both of the bottom of the lineups have potential but haven’t reached it all yet.
•
All three games are lopsided in pitching at least on paper. In game one, Hendricks has been pitching great lately and the Cubs have won 5 of the last 6 games he has pitched in. Game two comes down to Darvish because he’s been very inconsistent.  Game three is actually kind of even but Gray has struck out 75 in 72 innings and has been doing pretty good this year.

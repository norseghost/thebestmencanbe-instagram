                        "text": "Everybody got their movements/organizations and HUGE SUPPORT for them (especially from people outside of their cause) w/ little to NO OPPOSITION. For example, People from the #LGBT and #MeToo community/movement/organization have rights that they fight for, and they get supported (dollars, media coverage, huge Hollywood stars, unity). They fight for their basic human rights: to be respected, not to be discriminated against, just to name a few. ANYTIME that a person that happens to be WHITE, shoots up a school or a church and kills multiple people, the shooter goes to jail ALIVE. ANYTIME that police, who carry guns for a living, encounters a black man, that they think have a gun, which turns out to be a cellphone, or an open empty palm of their hand (nothing that looks like gun) or NO MOTHER FUCKING GUN, NO SHOTS FIRED, WE (BLACK MEN) 9 times out 10 don\u2019t get the opportunity to go jail ALIVE. What about our basic human rights to just continue living? Is that right not equally important as some of the other causes that people fight for and fully support? We just want to remain ALIVE. No disrespect to all the other movements and things that they represent, struggle with and fight for. Can we just continue LIVING and can we get some fucking support without the bullshit critics (some of our own people included). Fuck marching, fuck protesting, fuck boycotting, fuck just wanting to have the conversation. All them bullshit tactics are out dated, noneffective. No more Fake Ass Solutions, and waste of time demonstrations, or bullshit media press conferences of fake solidarity to calm tensions in the community #JusticeForRyanTwyman #WIPBenzo"

🥋self defense & martial arts training with @markg1518 was one of the best things I ever did for myself. I’ve been stalked multiple times, harassed, and seen so many women taken advantage of by men and nearly myself as well.  I was fed up! I would recommend learning any type of self-defense and fighting to anyone especially women and children. The only person that can protect you is you! Tell someone they need to learn how to defend and fight, it’s definitely one of the best things you can do for yourself and a great workout for both the mind and body🔥❤️🙏🏼🙌🏼

SOME MISCELLANEOUS FIRINGS * CONSENT |  Because I’ve had to define [repeatedly] what this word means to people who have entered my experience...and am choosing to do it again, publicly, as much for others as myself who so badly need the protection that can be found in clarity. So whether you’re a guy or a gal or anything in between, in case you didn’t know, consent is...
⠀⠀
- Reversible at any time.
- Never implied.
- Never silent.
- To be granted repeatedly, no matter how well you know someone or how often you’ve been intimate with them.
- Never implied.
- Never implied.

I am a victim of rape. And like so many other women I’ve talked to, I wasn’t aware that I’d been raped until years after it happened and I learned that the fact of my being in a relationship with my then-boyfriend was no justification for him to take me in my sleep. (Or choke me or hit me, for that matter, which were things he did as well).
⠀⠀
The reversibility piece is controversial. I hear people saying, “you were naked in a room with the boy so you had it coming.” Oh, so on entering a cave and seeing a loose rock falling you’re going to charge full speed ahead anyway?

Pass this on to anyone who will find it useful. Join me in hitting them over the head with it if you have to; I’ve been getting rather practiced at it. •

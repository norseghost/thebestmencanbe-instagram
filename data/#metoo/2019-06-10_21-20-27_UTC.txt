🦋 SURVIVOR BITCH 🦋

A bitch who has been through hell.
Finding strength in vulnerability and power in pain, this bitch uses their suffering to build empathy rather than apathy. Despite it all, they always provide support rather than judgement and allow others a space to be heard. This bitch knows that we have to unite against those who are threatened by us standing together.

I'll be talking about lesbian and queer sexual assault and intimate partner violence on a panel today for @feministsdeliver - and I also remember exactly what it feels like to live in a place where you don't have access to basic support, let alone panels, The Discourse, or crisis resources. This month is the six year anniversary of the original essay I wrote for @autostraddle on my own experience, when For Your Own Good was still very much a work-in-progress. The article is one place on the internet where I recommend you read the comments; if #metoo has also let you down (or if you didn't dare get your hopes or expectations up in the first place) you might see some part of yourself reflected there. Link's in bio - please note the article and comments contain descriptions of assault, which is affirming for me as someone who still has to explain the basics of her experience to people, but doesn't make it any easier to read. I'll have some resources that have been useful to me up in my stories today too - but what works for me won't work for everyone, so take good care.

Work v Family is always a tough tough question... Iâ€™ve seen women judged for working full time and putting their children into childcare, but Iâ€™ve also seen judgement for precisely the opposite! (Can we ever win?!) Plenty of women choose to go part time at work when they have kids, so they can do the school drop off and pick up, take their kids to after school activities etc. Or maybe just because itâ€™s tiring being both career woman and mum! ðŸ—£ Oh such a shame she gave up her career, she could have gone far
ðŸ—£ Sheâ€™s changed so much now sheâ€™s a mum
ðŸ—£ Sheâ€™ll never get that promotion now
ðŸ—£ Sheâ€™s given up too easily, why canâ€™t she do both

We all have our opinions on this, but just be real with yourself. We donâ€™t judge men like this. We donâ€™t put pressure on new fathers in the same way we do new mothers. We pick and prod and raise our eyebrows when we really donâ€™t know someoneâ€™s story.

Most women are making smart and balanced decisions - letâ€™s trust our fellow women and show them some support ðŸ™Œ

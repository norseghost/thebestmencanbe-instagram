Today’s Oracle - If you have had a period of going within, soul searching, feeling unsure, nothing quite fits in your life..... it can be unsettling but it is for a very good reason.  You have been dropping the old programs and belief systems running your life, slowly shedding old ways and relationships to make way for something new. Maybe you can feel something forming but not quite sure what is or maybe new opportunities are starting to present themselves to you. Make your choices from the Wise Heart! Don’t be tempted back into the old vibration of wanting. Wanting and waiting keeps us stuck in frustration and lack. Trust we have everything we need now and feel as if you do. Joy Love Inspired Abundant  Make your choices from the Heart! Let your heart and soul lead the way! Live Consciously, stay in your Heart. 💙❤️💗💛💓🌟🌷🙏☯️#leadfromyourheart#sacredheart#marymagdalene#mothermary#jesus#Goddess#DivineMasculine#DivineFeminine#oneness#weareone#healing#oraclecards#forgiveness#metoo#sacredpilgrimage

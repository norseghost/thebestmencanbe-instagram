The final healing phase of each @onthemendretreat is the process of reintegrating our pain and trauma into our lives in a positive way. Once the women have safely and bravely processed their “trauma narrative,” the last step of reintegration is to then cultivate their “coherent narrative.” Their coherent narrative allows them to answer the questions:
- How can I reclaim my pain for GOOD?
- How has this pain made be BETTER?
- And how can this pain be repurposed to make the  W O R L D  BETTER?
.
This is reintegration—the profound ability to look at your trauma and your pain with gratitude, and with purpose. We strive to help every woman walk into their coherent narrative. Are you ready to take that step?

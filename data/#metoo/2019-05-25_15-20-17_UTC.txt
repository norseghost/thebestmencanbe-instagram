A small glimpse into my happy place ✨ 
I’ve loved plants since I was little. Growing up, they always meant time with my dad and my grandma. We’d spend every single weekend planting flowers and trees. Now, plants have a different significance for me (though I still plant flowers every few weeks at my grandma’s!), as they were a huge part of my trauma recovery. I’d spend hours taking care of my plants because I wasn’t taking care of myself. I thought that if something deserved love and care, and I couldn’t take care of me, then I should love my plants. So now I have quite the collection of herbs, Tilly the tomato plant, a succulent garden, and about eight thousand seedlings. Something as “small” as plants had a huge impact on the way I viewed myself, and they were the catalyst that got me to learn to heal and grow as a person. I’ve also learned that humans are basically houseplants with more complicated emotions! A silly thought, but that was what formed the connection in my damaged mind that I needed to care for myself as I did my plants. I’m incredibly grateful for this realization, as I certainly wouldn’t be the person I am right now ✨

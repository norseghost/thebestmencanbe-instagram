(⚠️ TW:) Also a quick rant... I think it is irresponsible when movies tackle the subject of rape and show the victim at the police station the next morning, so clear and concise about what happened, already ready to report. Acting like the “perfect” victim. Sure that happens but more likely than not the victim is still reeling and trying their best to process the violation and trauma. It’s not always reconciled so easily. But needing time to process the assault does not invalidate what happened. If it takes a week, a month, 20 years to process what happened, it still doesn’t take away from the fact that it shouldn’t have happened. You were not at fault. #sexualassaultawareness #trauma #traumaawareness #supportsurvivors #empowersurvivors #believesurvivors #traumainformed #sexualassault #rape #abuse #resilience #metoo #metoomanyvoices #victim #survivor #education #resource #support #recovery #courage #mentoo #mentalhealthawareness #themoreyouknow #healing #sexeducation #traumahealing #ptsdrecovery #ptsd #ptsdawareness

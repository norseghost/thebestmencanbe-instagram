We live in a dynamic world where on the one hand women's rights are taken for granted and in some parts of the world they are being taken away! In the process of filming a video for my new single "The Other End" I discovered how much power women have when they unite with one message of the freedom to feel safe!
My new song talks about the importance of speaking out, asking for help and not letting anything slide. Because that's the only way to drown the silence and get to the other side.

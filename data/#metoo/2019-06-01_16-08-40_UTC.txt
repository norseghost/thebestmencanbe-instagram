Holy shit if you haven’t watched the documentary Audrie and Daisy (from 2015 on Netflix) please put it on your list. My eldest daughter and I watched it last night- it is SUCH an important film. 
If nothing else, you will notice the difference in attitudes and support from before and after the #metoo movement. Sometimes we need a reminder that progress is slow, but not for nothing. ✊

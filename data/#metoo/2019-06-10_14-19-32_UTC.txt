Last week I had the opportunity to address SAKI grantees on the importance/challenge of creating a policy for ‘unfounded cases.’ Submit all/test all but unfounded and cold case review of old kits has really shone light on this area for improvement. Great to hear from agencies on what they have been doing to improve their response to sexual assault and violent crimes!

365 days. 52 weeks. 1 year. since the rape. ◾️◾️◾️
i’ll forever hold the album that mercifully and serendipitously provided my healing soundtrack. the geometric lines showing me the all the pathways  necessary in creating who I’ve become today. And the fire rose unity survivor symbol, proving to me that i have the strength to grow from this event in which i am connected to so many others with. ◾️◾️◾️
cheers to the healing process.

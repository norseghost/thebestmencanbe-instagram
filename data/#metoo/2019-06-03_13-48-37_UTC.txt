Reformation by James Martin Charlton 
Directed by Janice Dunn
Produced by Nayomi Roshini

Reformation is a play about those who don't make the history books. The story of a young woman who finds herself in a world where the desires of the powerful have priority. The production has striking resonances to the #TimesUp and #metoo movements.

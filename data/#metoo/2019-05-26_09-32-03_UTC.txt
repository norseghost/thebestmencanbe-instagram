The famous Molly Malone (inspired many an Irish ditty). She sold fish during the day and a bit of herself at night ... (one does what one has to sometimes) ... it seems though that current patrons still canâ€™t keep their hands off her breasts ... I wonder if this commemorative statue would have survived our nations current #metoo movement.

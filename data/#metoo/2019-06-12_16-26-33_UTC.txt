Once a month, I go to this American-Japanese networking forum in this swanky Roppongi Hills clubroom. Each month we talk about a topic and exchange ideas between folks from different cultures. Most topics tend to be super thought provoking like #Metoo in Japan, cyber security, global warming, Trump, etc.

While the seating arrangements change from month to month, I keep getting paired with this Japanese university student and at least one guy who dominates the discussion the entire night. Sometimes itâ€™s a different guy, but with the same overbearing attitude. I was not having it tonight, and Honoka felt my pain.

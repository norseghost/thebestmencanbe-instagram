OUR GOVERNMENT AND LAWS AREN’T A GUIDE TO HUMAN DECENCY AND MORALITY. It’s truly up to us to put pressure on the government to do the right thing. When it comes to climate change, immigration, trans rights and protections, disabled rights, women’s rights and the freedom and liberties of all people. To stand with the government is to stand in the past. To make change we must press forward with an agenda to protect and free people who need it most.

I finally popped my tattoo cherry with a piece I’ve wanted since 2017. 
July of 2017 Lady Gaga performed “Til It Happens to You” at the Oscars. Not only was I moved by this performance but the song at the time was a lyrical and visual representation of what I was going through. So much so that I often times use it to silence the people who were ignorant about the psychological, emotional, and physically effects that an assault can have on an individual.

Though my journey has not been easy and I continue to battle with that chapter in my life every now and again. I must admit I have gained a tremendous amount of strength, resilience and perseverance. Things that no one can ever take away from me. 
Read more about my story: iamnellyj.com “The tattoo was made for and dedicated to survivors. It is a unity symbol inspired by the loops of our DNA structure and our universal infinity sign. It combines inspiration from Lady Gaga's favorite flower, the white rose, to breathe life into an organic and growing symbol. The final image embraces a fiery shape to give us power and strength everywhere we go”

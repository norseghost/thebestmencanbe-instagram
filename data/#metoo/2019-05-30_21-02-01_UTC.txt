A few months ago I commented back on something @sandipattyp had posted, and for the first time I typed in my own #metoo hashtag.  I had listened to a podcast earlier that day where she bravely shared her own story, and it truly touched me on a cellular level.

Since my mid twenties I haven’t hid the fact that I was sexually abused as a child..but I haven’t spoken openly about it either. 
The most amazing gift the #metoo movement offers all of us that have experienced the trauma of abuse is a chance to come out from behind our shame, stand shoulder to shoulder with other survivors and bravely say “me too.” Today on Afternoons with Ems I discuss the pain of healing from the trauma of my abuse and how I now use all of that hard stuff and that hard healing work as a springboard of motivation to propel me into the life I desire to live.

The woman in this picture..she went from victim, to survivor, to thriver.  Let’s go.

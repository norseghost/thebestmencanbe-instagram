#Reparations: a heartfelt financial apology that doesn't always feel good to colonizers, sexual predators, and the company they keep.

Just the other day, news agencies across the planet announced a likely $44 million dollar financial settlement for the violence of Harvey Weinstein and his associate conspirators in luring women into rooms where rape, assault, and harassment took place.

That financial settlement isn’t necessarily reparations. It is a court-based decision. It was negotiated by #lawyers in the #courts and closed #offices. Witnesses provided #testimony, so did #victims and the sexual #predator himself. I’ll say his name, and it’s #HarveyWeinstein. No one procured a solution to #RapeCulture.

Not one penny of this tentative settlement ensures that #HealingJustice was had by the women who were raped, abused, and entrapped by Weinstein and his associate conspirators. Reparations need to feel just, honest, and restorative to the people most harmed by violence. They also need to be fully #transparent and #accountable, not obscured by #legalism and the requisite #confidentiality agreements of arbitration.

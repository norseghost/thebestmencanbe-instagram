Thank you @fatimata25 Fatima Ishiaku for the courage to speak up.
Fatima is a #sexualviolence survivor who recalls being raped daily by her step father from age 7 to 14. Do you know all the while she thought that was her biological Father? and that her mother never believed what she was going through? .
Fast forward to today she can proudly say she is a survivor. She hopes that more men can be conscious about the role they play in supporting girls and women to attain their full potential.

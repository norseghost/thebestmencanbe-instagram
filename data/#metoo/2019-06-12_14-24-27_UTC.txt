So many people can struggle to understand why prolonged exposure to childhood trauma could affect one's personality or identity so harshly - or why conditions like Dissociative Identity Disorder, Complex PTSD and even BPD (which also lacks a stable sense of self), emerge at all vs. classic PTSD. While it makes sense to them that a survivor may be traumatized or experience flashbacks, nightmares and hypervigilance - why their identity, emotions, relationships, etc are so compromised can remain a mystery. In resignation to understand, the general public can even default to hurtful phrases like "Well, sure, I guess it'd just screw them up in all kinds of ways." But, it's not nearly as haphazard as that. There's a very specific reason these areas are so challenging; it is not random and survivors are NOT 'screwed up'.

Children in abusive situations are constantly having to shift their reality, how they see themselves, as well as the scary people in their lives (many of whom are supposed to be taking care of them) just to maintain any sense of safety, sanity or comfort. They must convince themselves to find ways to trust the untrustworthy; feel security in situations that are unsafe; find calm and a sense of control in an environment that's wildly unpredictable; bend who they are, how they feel, how MUCH they feel, and what they think, just to appease violent abusers; to manufacture a sense of power or hope despite crushing helplessness.
.
It's unsurprising that when these children grow up they continue to do just this with everyone in their lives. They may seem like chameleons, shapeshifters, or just so unsure of everything they detach from any identity at all. These survivors are still trying to triage all of their physical and emotional needs through the same childlike system of defenses they adapted when they were young. It's going to take time to first unlearn and then re-learn a new way - figuring out who they are, owning their thoughts, feeling safe in a wide variety of emotions, and understanding what healthy relationships even are.

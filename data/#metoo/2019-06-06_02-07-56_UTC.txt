Vulcana in partnership with WaW Dance, Nia Australia and Brisbane Domestic Violence Service, created a powerful public presence through dance, to call for an end to violence against women. 
On Sunday 12 February 2017, there was a public workshop with Nia Australia in the Stores Studio, followed by a flashmob dance in the park of Brisbane Powerhouse. Minister Shannon Fentiman attended the event and addressed the performers and viewers. Funds were raised through the workshop to support BDVS and their work with survivors of domestic violence.â €

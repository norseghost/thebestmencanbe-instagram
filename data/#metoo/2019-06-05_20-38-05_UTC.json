My name is Hannah for all of you who didn't know. \nI'm inviting you to come along with me on my journey of healing my heart through organic gardening and other sorts of earthly endeavors. \nIve got a yard that has seen about 10 years of neglect and this summer, I am diving in head first to take my power back! \nSome back story: When I was 7 years old my dad, already divorced from my mum, moved out of our house. This was the beginning of a chaotic new chapter in me and my family's lives. To support my two brother's and I, my Mum worked 3+ job's at a time to keep the roof over our heads. As we were all struggling with our schooling and with our mental health, many area's of our lives were subject to neglect. I loved gardening and being outside as a kid! As the year's went by, I became unmotivated, exhausted and consumed by emotional and physical pain.\n\nMany hard event's and struggles led up to 2014, when I was hospitalized for an attempt at suicide. and since then have been on a journey crazier then I could have ever imagined. Every time I hit rock bottom I found out that rock bottom had its own rock bottom, and so I spent multiple years digging myself deeper and deeper into the hole. I've endured a lot of pain and grief, fear and sorrow, but I took the steps to change it and I'd consider myself now a Survivor.\n\nNow in 2019 things have finally reached a point where I can say I've never felt so good in my lifetime. This is the first summer I've felt the strength in myself to stop JUST surviving and start living.\n\nSo here I am on instagram, reconciling my relationship with myself, the planet and with the things I love!! Come along with me on the healing journey of moving forward and using my new found strength to create something beautiful! \n#metoo #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #love #selfcare #selflove #health #mentalillness #recovery #motivation #wellness #inspiration #healing #positivevibes #happiness #wellbeing #stopthestigma #stigma #organic #sustainable #gardening #gardene #landscaping #plantsmakepeoplehappy #green #gardeninspiration #plant #greenthumb  #growyourownfood"

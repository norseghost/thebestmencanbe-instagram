I love my cast so frikkin’ much - what an amazing grouplette I’ve been fortunate enough to assemble. Our tech rehearsal took longer than anticipated & there are lots of kinks to be ironed out but we got there eventually. Huge thanks to Jesse Fiene for her patience & hard work tonight. I’ve got lots of work to do to fix some sound cues... oops! And it’s nerve wracking not having an actual run through before the opening show. It’s only theatre, we’re telling stories not solving the problems of the world. Though truth be told we might be offering some insights. Come & see the show! “Yes. No. Maybe.” #yesnomaybeplay #complexhollywood #lgbtq🌈 #bisexual #actorslife #lathtr #metoo #hff19 Book tickets here: https://www.hollywoodfringe.org/projects/6096

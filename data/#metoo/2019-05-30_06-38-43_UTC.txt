Two years ago we announced the first of our amazing Patrons... Toyah Willcox. She played Dora Maar in the original production of @PicassosWomen. She continues to support us alongside the amazing Dame Judi Dench and art historian Professor Elizabeth Cowling... Three phenomenal women, support three phenomenal women!

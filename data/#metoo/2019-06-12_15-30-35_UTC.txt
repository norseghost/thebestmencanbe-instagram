Outing - the act or practice of revealing the homosexuality of a person.

This is not up to anyone else but the individual. It is not your job to out someone. Outing someone who is keeping their sexual orientation private is a malicious act. There are multiple reasons why people choice to keep their sexual orientation personal. Some to include: position, fear of rejection, fear of retaliation, safety being jeopardize and most importantly IT'S THEIR CHOICE TO DO SO!

Holding their sexuality over their head so they'll act accordingly is manipulation and frankly disgusting. This is not only found abusive in IPV relationships but familial and platonic relationships. Don't be the person to break trust this way.

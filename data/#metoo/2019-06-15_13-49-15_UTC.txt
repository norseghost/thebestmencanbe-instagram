"In the #MeToo era, men are victims too." This sentence gives me pause.  A great big, (silent inward scream want to throat punch someone) pause. When I stop to gather myself and think about the statement, it gives me another pause.  One that has me thinking, "How so? How are men victims."

I've thought long and hard about this topic, since dealing with my own truma.  I have the opportunity to walk with executive producer and host of Vox Media's, "Consider It," @feministabulous as she poses the insightful question, "How do we detox from toxic masculinity?" in her book, ""For the Love of Men: A New Vision for Mindful Masculinity."

I know this will be a challenging read for me but one that I believe will be real and relevant as I seek to teach my daughter how to love herself and others well.

Have there been books that you knew were going to challenge you? Did you read them? Where you glad? Mad? Frustrated? Thankful?  I'd love to hear them and your thoughts.

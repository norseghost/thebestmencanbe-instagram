Our whole childhood is all about shaping us to fit in. We (in Australia atleast) all must wear the same uniform, follow the rules of the system, not question the adults around us, don't be bossy, don't dob on others etc etc So as adults when we start to come into our own, celebrating our uniqueness is everything! I do think increasingly our children and teens are learning to be independent thinkers. All you have to do is watch the climate change protests by school children to see that. So let's encourage this in ourselves as much as we do for our children! Let's speak up against the dominant voice, the 'norm' and advocate for more! More activism, diversity, tolerance, acceptance, justice, peace, love! Less patriarchy, misogyny, racism, discrimination, hate! Lets revolutionise this world! ðŸ“· by @theresgoodinstore

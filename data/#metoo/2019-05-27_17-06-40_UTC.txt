💔Rp @lodilightning Scared and so stressed that they start chewing on each other.. The trucks are so crammed that they have to lay on each other, they can't turn, can't walk and can barely move.. forced to grow this big this quickly.. forced to be ready for slaughter in 2-6 months.. Some can't even stand due to their weight pressing on their joints.. laying in their and others feces. They live in hell. This is the first time they have seen sunlight.. How can we let this happen to these babies.. how can you look away.. 💔 how can you pretend that this isn't your fault? please go vegan for them please. If you're not vegan animals die for you.. these babies die for you... I'm so sorry babies.. I will never forget you, I will never forget what they did to you.. I will always carry you in my heart.. rest in peace my loves.. I am so so sorry... I love you..❤ #govegan #pig #pigs #babypig #piggie #baconlover #littlepiggie #pigsofig #pigsofinstagram #misspiggy #teacup #piglets #pigstagram #minipig #piglife #piglove #puerco #blt #poorbaby #potbellypig #skinnypig #ham #burrito #babybackribs #vegano #metoo #seperation #donttakeourplanetforgranted

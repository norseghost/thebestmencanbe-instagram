Lil bit of history here folks. I just found this while hunting for my stash of euros. 
Back in my very early career I worked in Trading Standards. I was miserable. 
It was sexist. It was racist. It was uncomfortable. 
In the end I bought football referee packs for myself and 3 other young women in the team. We used them to ‘jokingly’ call out unacceptable comments from our colleagues. I generally could only issue a yellow card for sexist comments as I had to keep the red for racist ones. 
I have a bucket load of #metoo examples. Some worse than others. It made me miserable for 4 years. And when I left, 6 months before I fully qualified, everyone thought I was mad. I can not articulate the relief, and the positive effect it had on my mental health. I joined a company where I was interviewed by 3 women. 2 were under 30, 1 of whom was black. I couldn’t imagine anything further removed from my previous role and accepted the job based on the people (because I had no idea what it was!!!). Finding these this morning reminds me that I tried to address things at the time. Even as young and inexperienced as I was, I felt it was important to call it where I saw it. Trying to do it in a way that didn’t get me fired. I’m a little proud of 22 year old me!

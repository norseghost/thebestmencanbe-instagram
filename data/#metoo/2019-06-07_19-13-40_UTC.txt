Friday finishing. It was good to have company and input and support in the space today.

Because this isn’t hard enough! Let’s see what @ihefin makes of it all next week... #fightinglikeagirlandwhatittaughtme #sanskrit #welsh #linguisticheadaches #ammanfordminerstheatre #theatrausirgar #dance #solo #choreography #researchanddevelopment #martialarts #yoga #womenmartialartists #metoo #welshdance #artscouncilwales #cyngorcelfyddydaucymru

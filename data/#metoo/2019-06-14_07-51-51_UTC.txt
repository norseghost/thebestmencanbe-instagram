Good Morning My Fierce Fabulous Family  its fierce female friday here's Today's quote 
This is one of the best quotes to inspire the over analysers and pessimists across the world. Bad days and bad people happen to all of us. You cannot change the past but you can choose to make your present better. It would be a torture if you let your past experiences affect your present happiness each day. Just let it go and look forward. A bad yesterday is a lesson learnt, so use it to do better today; only brooding wonâ€™t help.

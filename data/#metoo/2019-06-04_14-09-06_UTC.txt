Born of Violence not only chronicles the road of abuse that led me to that fateful morning on September 20, 2011, but it shows:

1. God is still in the miracle making business
2. Practical advice to help you or someone you love address abuse
3. Spiritual insight on how to overcome your own personal tragedies with a spotlight on forgiveness, your support networks, and much, much more!

So even if you have NOT gone through abuse, this book teaches you how to turn your tragedies to Triumph!

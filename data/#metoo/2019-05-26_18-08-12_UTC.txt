I’ve not posted much for a while. Been consumed by real life, sometimes kicking like mad to keep my head above water, other times floating on air enjoying the magnificence of my expansion in this human experience.
There’s some wonderful stuff happening, huge healing taking place and growth beyond what I ever expected. There’s also some tough, raw challenges right now which are requiring me to dig deep and show up in a way I have never been fearless enough to do before.
The fragile heart and weak voice that was once mine, has transformed into (and continues to do so) a strength that is unshakable, even if it doesn’t feel that way always and a power has been unleashed that as yet I have only tasted a sweet mouthful of.
What once felt utterly unobtainable and not even worth dreaming about because ‘I believed I knew’ I didn’t deserve it, is unfolding before my very eyes.
I’ve also not posted much as things just felt boring and like I didn’t want to be spewing out similar messages to so many others- same old samey sameness. Can you relate? Trying hard to put your own spin on something, it just so often wreaks of ego to me. It’s a fine line between writing from the heart and navigating your way through the shadows and murky lands; and just falling into the trap of coming from a point of knowing rather than a point of enquiry.
I will leave you with one of my favourite ever quotes from Rumi: “somewhere between right and wrong there is a garden, I’ll meet you there”. Just sharing some random thoughts as I finally felt inspired to✨

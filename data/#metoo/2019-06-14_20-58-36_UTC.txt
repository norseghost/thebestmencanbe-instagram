Kofi Danso is the Sr. Pastor at Miracle Arena For All Nations, and my husband and I are ex-pastors. It is with a sad heart that I have to write this post. There are so many other things I would rather be talking about right now. Things like; how to have an amazing love life with your husband or how to enjoy being a single Christian woman.

But, when I decided to start this blog, I made a commitment to God that I would share honest answers and Biblical advice. My goal is to help Christian women by answering their toughest questions. With that being said, I never thought that the topic of Kofi Danso as a false Prophet or cult leader would be one of those questions. But it is.

For those who have no connection with Miracle Arena For All Nations or “prophet” Kofi Danso, please don’t skip this post. I’m going to talk openly about the red flags every Christian woman needs to watch for in a ministry and I hope that this info will save someone from a world of pain.

Baby Mandi!!! üòç I found this pics while I was deleting photos from my phone. She looks so different now. 7 years later and she is brown and just as calm. She use to love looking out the bay window at home. She would be there for hours. We don‚Äôt have a bay window anymore but she looks out the back door. I love her. She is so sweet. How old is your fur baby/babies? .

For all you who love gun control you are simply pushing to strip good people of their ability to self defense. Criminals never have nor will follow the laws.

Law enforcement wont be there to save you when it counts more often than not.

Crime in Seattle is actually rising. The loss of police officers to patrol the streets as well as a City Countil that demaneds the removal of the Civil Right of Self Defense of all residents, visitors, and commuters is being seen now.
It has taken only a few short years to devolve,
Now, the elderly are being preyed upon
The used needles are piling up on the sidewalks, the parks, the cemetaries.
The sidewalks are steamed cleaned with sanitizers in downtown and near the University of Washington

With the Anti-Rights initiative 1639, now law, effective as of 1 July 2019, the ability of those in King, Pierce Counties; Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, and the rest of Washington state to exercise their Human Right of Self Defense will be stopped.
There is no calling 911, for the Police will not be there in time.

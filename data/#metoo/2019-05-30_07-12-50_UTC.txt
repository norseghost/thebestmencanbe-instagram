There are thousands, maybe even millions of people who dream of being entrepreneurs, have good ideas and still never take the next steps necessary to make that dream a reality.
 Why is this?.
. - I’m not good enough to be an entrepreneur.
.
.
- I don’t have enough funding.
. -It’s not the right time.
.
.
- I’m worried I’ll fail.

There’s a common misconception out there that entrepreneurs are “born” to be entrepreneurs, or that successful entrepreneurs have some essential genetic quality that makes it possible for them to succeed and stifles the progress of anyone else. 
This simply isn’t true.
There are some factors that make it easier for people to transition into an entrepreneurial role, such as high enthusiasm, extroversion and a tendency to attack problems head-on. However, these can all be learned, mimicked or substituted by people who don’t exhibit these qualities naturally. In short, you can be as good or bad an entrepreneur as you want to be -- you just have to do a little work to get there. .

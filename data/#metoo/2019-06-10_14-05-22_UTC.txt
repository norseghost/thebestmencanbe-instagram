The #MeToo Movement Will Headline Art Basel Unlimited This Year With Andrea Bowers’s Epic Account of America’s Harassment Reckoning. 
Open Secrets, 2018, consists of 100 photographic prints. Each print lists the name and occupation of an accused person in the #MeToo movement, followed by their „apology“ and an up-to-date summary including details of the accusations, job status of the accused, legal actions, and other pertinent details. Some of the prints contain related photos.

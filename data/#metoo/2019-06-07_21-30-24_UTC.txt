Last night at the NYA Gallery Art Walk. I invited the audience into my mind, let them observe as long as they wanted and it was a dream. Thank you so much @kalliekalliekallie for embodying each painting. You captured it perfectly. Also a big thank you to @julianlazaro  for the phenomenal make up. •

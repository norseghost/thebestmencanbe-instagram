Ordered 25 copies of #RageBecomesHer by @sorayachemaly to give away. I’m 2/3 of the way through and I’m feeling some kind of way about getting to the end. I’ve had friends tell me they feel this way about novels - thrillers, romance, humor, and about auto/biographies. But not researched thought works on social ills. I’m strange or I’m deep, or both. Lol. This book is validating, sobering, enlightening, paradigm shifting, grounding. It is also liberating. It’s what you think it’s about and also NOT what you think it’s about. The best read I’ve picked up in years. Get you some. #genderequality #genderbias #sexism #metoo #womensrights #humanrights #empowerment #emotion #wellbeing #mentalhealth #womenlead #leadership #facts #saturday #knowledgeispower

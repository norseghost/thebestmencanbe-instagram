So many experiences can try and knock us down, sometimes we feel there is nothing we can do but let it. Other times we can feel our strength catching on to these situations and fighting back the only way we know how. We are wonderful  and beautiful exactly as we are, but can only flourish surrounded by likeminded, supportive, open minded souls. Letâ€™s create this space for us to learn more about how we can spread this empowerment everywhere we go and to everyone we meet. #equality #empoweringwomen #girlpower #metoo #girlssupportgirls #empowerment #love #bristol

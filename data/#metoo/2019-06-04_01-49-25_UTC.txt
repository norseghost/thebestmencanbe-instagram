On May 22nd, 2018, my life was completed altered. I went on vacation and it immediately turned into a nightmare that I didn’t ask for. I was sexually assaulted. I was hurt. Confused. Broken. Disgusted. - AND SO, my survivor journey began. My journey to take back my life. On this journey I have contemplated suicide, wrote out my notes to my family and friends telling them goodbye, almost dropped out of college, couldn’t get out of bed, lacked motivation, and wanted to just simply, not be here. 
All of that led to my amazing support system pushing me to go to therapy, seek help, and push myself to find me again. I am now a year old SURVIVOR who is ready to uplift, motivate, speak for those who can’t speak, and help  others. 
Sooooooooo, long story short, WE SURVIVED!

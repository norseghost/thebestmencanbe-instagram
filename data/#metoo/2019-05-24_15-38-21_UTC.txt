HELP MAKE STRANGULATION A FELONY AND STEP PARENTS PROTECTED UNDER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS IN EVERY STATE!

I am grateful for my life practice of trying to be better everyday. I had something to fall back on when my life was shattered after being strangled to near death in front of my husband and children partially exposed. 🧘🏼‍♀️♥️ #everyday #yoga #heal #thrive

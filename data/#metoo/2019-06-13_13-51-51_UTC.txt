He was staring at me with the eyes of a horny bastard. That whole stare was tearing me apart. I was in a passenger train, going to my home town. And the person started staring at me this way, and I felt like someone was RAPING me! A rape where no 'rod' was shoved inside my body, where no body part was physically assaulted and abused but all of my soul was ripped up into thousands and millions of pieces. I felt uneasy and stressed with the whole idea, confused from every point, I was just looking outside the window, praying for the station to arrive soon.
And this is how one more experience was added to the list of molestation. - Bohagi Singh

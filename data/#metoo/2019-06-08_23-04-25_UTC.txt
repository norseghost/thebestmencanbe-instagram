Another drawing by a Saudi woman without a voice in her country. She sent us this saying: ”her lips are sewed together so she wont speak up but she tries anyways and she bleeds. This is how i see myself and my sisters in this country.” Thank you! ❤️❤️❤️😢 keep sending us art women and girls to spread to the world! .

Today, June 1st, is World Narcissistic Abuse Awareness Day. I’ll continue to share my story in hopes that it will continue to help others. #ifmywoundswerevisible the world would view my scars from emotional/verbal abuse the same way as those from the physical abuse. Thankfully, with years of hard work, love, patience & support from those around me I have become stronger than ever.💜 WARNING SIGNS: ⚠️They have a sense of superiority. For example being highly critical or often judgmental about others.
⚠️They have a sense of entitlement, sometimes this comes off as confidence, but can manifest in subtle ways, like cutting through a service station rather than wait at the traffic lights, or deliberately leaving rubbish for someone else to pick up.
⚠️They give out back-handed compliments, such as “she has a figure like yours, you know, slim but no muscle tone."
In a romantic relationship, the relationship moves quickly, for example, they will shower you with attention, compliments or gifts, and say “I love you” very early on in the relationship.
⚠️They will start to subtly ignore you. They may appear to lose interest/get distracted or check their phone while you’re talking.
⚠️Their seemingly innocent words are often contradicted by their body language and tone of voice.
⚠️Their stories don’t quite add up, and you start to see the little white lies. You may even tell yourself, “I just heard them lie to their friend, it was just a little white lie. But s/he wouldn’t lie to me."
⚠️They have two sets of rules. Rules that apply to them, and rules that apply to everyone else. They may have unrealistic expectations of love and nurturing from others, but don't hold themselves to the same high standards.
⚠️They have a lack of empathy and are unable to put themselves in the shoes of others.
⚠️They have poor boundaries, and may regularly invade your privacy, go through your belongings, or expect that you mind read their wishes and needs.
⚠️They may be highly sensitive to criticism, or any suggestion that they are not in the right.
⚠️They have a "my way or the highway" attitude. They believe that they know best and that their way of doing things is the correct way.

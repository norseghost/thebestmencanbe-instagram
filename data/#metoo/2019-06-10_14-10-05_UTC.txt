Having no equality is a strong reason of rape. Learning and blending equality in every way possible in our life starts at home. It all begins with our parents and surroundings. How many of us have told that boys are better than girls? Boys have the right to do whatever they want to but a girl should never have the thought of freedom?
Let's clean the foundation first. Let's teach our kids and parents that equality is not a right to be fought for but it is a mere existence to be respected. Let's start the change with us!

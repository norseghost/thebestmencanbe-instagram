Bar.Begov presents ➡️ home-made wild cherry tea
📸📸📸 So I’ve been quite busy lately and I needed a break. I went to the mountain and while wandering around, I found this cherry tree. Of course I had to try the fruits. Later on I found out these were wild cherries. So I was inspired by the nature, the cool spring air and the sun to make this homemade cherry ice tea, just for those moments when you just need to get a break.

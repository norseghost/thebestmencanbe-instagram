ðŸŒˆ Lately God has been using so many beautiful souls to encourage his "Beloved" to believe again!!! I see and hear it everywhere... God sending the sweet words I need and at just the right time! ðŸ™Œ So when I showed up at ballet today, I met a new friend that knew nothing of what I'de been through "#metoo" and yet she felt compelled to give me this bracelet that she made. It reads"mirclz" and what a blessing it is to get yet another word of confirmation from the Lord. ðŸ’– He is still the great miracle maker and chain breaker and He says... "I am coming" Just watch and see what I will do for my bride!  #miraclesarecoming âœ¨ #arielariseandshine

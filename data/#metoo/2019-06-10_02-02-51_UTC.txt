I haven't posted in a long time.
That's because I have been doing so much better and I focused solely on my positives for a while.  I haven't had a flashback since February. I havent self harmed since February. I feel stronger. I feel calmer.  I still have rough days and bad nights, but I am winning my battles.
Last fall I started doing yoga and that is a big part of why Im doing so well. 
I will be getting back into the habit of posting more frequently again.  I need to share my journey more.  I know how much it can help others.  If I can rise from my nightmares, so can you.  Here, in love and peace. Namaste.

I want to give a shoutout to everyone who has helped me now and in my past. To the people who let me sleep on their couch when I had no place to go. To the people who helped me with my mental health. To the people who saw the good in me when no one else did. I want to thank every single one of you because without u guys I wouldn't be where I am today. If you would have asked me at 16 where I see my life going I probably would have said " I won't make it past my 18th" look at me now 19 almost 20 and still here smiling. Life is shit sometimes but it does get better ðŸ’œðŸ’œ #mentalhealthawarness #metoo  #thankyou #iloveyouall #buryyourdemons ðŸ’œðŸ’œ

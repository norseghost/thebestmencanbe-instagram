Workplace investigations are a last resort. ⠀
Why? Because all other options for resolution should have been exhausted before reaching this point. ⠀
It is essential to have an effective grievance policy in place; however, we are perhaps too quick to look to the code of practice for guidance when incidences occur in the workplace.⠀
For the most part, grievances can often be resolved through good management or mediation, as well as investing in preventative methods for toxic workplace behaviour, such as training, an anonymous reporting employee hotline, and cultivating a culture of openness and honesty.

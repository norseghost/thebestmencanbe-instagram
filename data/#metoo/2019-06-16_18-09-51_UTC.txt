I'm delighted to announce, that leading up to my nomination for Miss World Guyana, I am launching my "BEAUTY WITH A PURPOSE" campaign. My campaign, "STRENGTH OVER SILENCE" is a personal one, and very important to me - Championing survivors of sexual violence, raising awareness, and creating the conditions in our society where this type of violence is not accepted or dismissed.

This is an excerpt from my NEW BLOG POST live on my website!⁣

Before I watched the @netflix documentary “Knock Down the House”, I joked that the movie would eventually have me thinking about running for office. Now that I’ve watched the documentary, I can still guarantee y’all that I don’t want to run for office. But if you’re just like me and don’t plan to make a bid for office, I still think the film is worth watching. It has great commentary on community building and the importance of having a strategy. ⁣

How many of us even know that 1out of 6 Men were abused as boys.There is a particular focus of the problem faced only by men. It arises from our culture providing no room for a man as a victim. 
If a male victim seeks help society should offer the same protection and help him. Women who are violent should be held legally responsible for their actions. 
Importantly be aware and keep your eyes and ears open to Men around you who could be sufferers too and may need your support. 
Gender equality should be for all  be it Women and Men too.

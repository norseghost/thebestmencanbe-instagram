•@shondarhimes is now the highest paid TV show runner & effortlessly addresses sexism & racism in her shows, as well as @ava @issarae & many others. I’m also so proud of @disney for making intentional efforts to portray women as #VictorsNotVictims.

#WCWtip—Although we’re making huge strides in film & no longer allowing the silencing & passive roles for women, we have a long way to go💯 👉🏾In this month’s @essence magazine I 🤓that only 4% of the top grossing films over the last decade were directed by women which has sparked the #4PercentChallenge in the film industry⭐️ "Dreams do not come true just because you dream them. It's hard work that makes things happen. It's hard work that creates change."—@shondarhimes🌟

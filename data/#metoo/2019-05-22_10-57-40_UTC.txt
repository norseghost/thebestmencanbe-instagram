Reproductive rights rally downtown Marquette! Lots showed up(there were just as many of us on the other side of the street!). And to the lady that gave us the finger as she drove by: that was perfect. Thank you. Now, times to get on the phones, times to write letters, time to get back the rights that we deserve!

Good Morning My Fierce Fabulous Family  its simply Saturday here's Today's quote 
Discipline in any form is rigorous, monotonous, boring and downright painful. It is distasteful enough to tempt you to quit your pursuits every morning before waking up. But the real achievers do get up and go through hell. They know that once they come out of this, they would be brighter than the shiniest diamond. The sharpest of swords go through the hottest of fires. The price you are paying now will pay you great dividends in future. But not getting up at all and making any efforts will eventually lead to regret which will be more painful.

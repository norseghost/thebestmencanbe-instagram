                        "text": "Ironman Wisconsin\n.\nMy 2nd Full Ironman.\nI had been back from filming the show Survivor only 8 weeks so I did this race on virtually no training. Maybe 2-4 swims, 2-10 mile runs and a couple long bike rides.  It was 100% \ud83d\udc96 and \ud83d\udd25.\n.\nI was a little numbed our going into this race as I had a lot swirling around in my head and body but I knew I wanted to complete this race. I\u2019ve never felt so comfortable in a race. Yes it hurt at times and there were dark moments but I was HAPPY during the race seeing my loved ones and friends on the course.\n.\nThe Finish Line was very special as my Oldest Boy was able to give me my medal and I\u2019ll never forget it as long as I live \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n.\nTruthfully this was one of the last times I remember feeling anxiety free as shortly after this race, I couldn\u2019t suppress some trauma any longer. And it hit me full force.\n.\nFor the past 21 months now, I\u2019ve lived on and off with anxiety and only until about the past 5 months do I feel I have a grip on it. Most days \ud83d\ude43. However, for many reasons I was unable to race (I\u2019ve mentioned them in previous posts). Getting my heart rate up felt a lot like panic and anxiety and my body and mind would shut me down from training.\n.\nI had to DNS (did not start) many races I had signed up for last year. Oceanside 70.3, a few Olympic Distances locally and Ironman Louisville. My anxiety got the best of me and it was all I could do to survive the day to day, let alone train for periods of time.\n.\nWith help and support, I\u2019ve moved through a lot of my trauma and healing. Asking for help from family and friends, trained professionals and also the Path of Love Retreat helped heal my spirit and soul. Revitalizing my system and helping me find my inner strength and passion again.\n.\nAs I approach my race this Sunday, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s retriggered a lot of anxiety in me. Combined with some big life altering decisions, my moon cycle and end of school year for my boys ... it\u2019s been a perfect storm for my anxiety to resurface...\n.\nContinued in Comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd"

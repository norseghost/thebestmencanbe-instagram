We all experience street harassment at one point or another. But talking and meeting people from #Colombia, that happens less there. They can freely put on a bit of cleavage or show some legs without being harassed. A friend of mine has been surprised to learn that it is the other way around here, in France and especially Paris. A modern country, richer than hers. My sister doesnâ€™t set foot in public transportation and I always take it with a pepper spray. This is not normal. I wish all those guys catcalling us would think of their wife or gf, or mother or sisters and rethink it all. #streetharassment #stopstreetharassment #metoo #assholes

In my head I'm not good enough...
I did this, I love it, I look at it and see its beauty. But I still can't fathom that I did it. The loudest voice in my head says ;not good enough. It's the voice that tortures me daily. I strive to do everything correctly. In a family of perfectionists and control freaks it's impossible not to. I constantly feel as if I'm failing somewhere. I'm not conservative enough (I gave up on this as I know at 32 I'm definitely not ever going to be!), not religious enough(too much spiritual weird hippy nonsense), not ladylike enough, not gentle enough, too blunt, too sweary(oops but fuck it I swear I'm human - studies show people who swear are more honest so it's technically a good thing!),too ballsy, too direct, don't concider fragile male egos or gender stereotypes enough, too political, too passionate, just tooo damn much!

But what if instead of trying to be as small as possible, biting holes through my toungue, bending myself to fit others comfort, I just embraced my muchness, my essence my me-Ness? ðŸ¤”

What if I let the colours escape my mind? What if I let me be me?! What if I am actually more than enough... What if we've got this? What if being ourselves is exactly good enough?

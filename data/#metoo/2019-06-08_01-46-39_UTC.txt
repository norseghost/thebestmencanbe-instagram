FYI, I stood in front of this street art and chatted through the stitch style with another woman admiring it as we each passed by. We actually both touched the “branch” and admired the artistry of this spring message and how amazing to see such workmanship. It is only now as I go to post it that I realize she and I were publicly stroking a penis and the message is about an erection. I am surprised neither of us were arrested. I will await the arrival of police to my door... #art #streetart #crochet #makers #knitting #design #mural #LA #metoo

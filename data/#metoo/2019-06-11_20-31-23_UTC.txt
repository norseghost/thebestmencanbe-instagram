“Our country is going through a regressive period because of our president and his supporters. With hateful voices having more of a platform these days, I think it's important to have a play like WIFEY that explores these issues in a new way. The use of movement and absurdism in this production really open the discussion to the audience about what it's going to take to start healing the wounds our society has suffered under our president and his bigoted administration. This play speaks to me because it's about what it means to be yourself in America right now and is a call for women not to lose sight of their power.” – @norafreebird AKA Nora Abayomi Papke

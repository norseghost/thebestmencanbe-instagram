#fridayfeels part 2 And after reflecting on that evening and after some introspective thought, I started to become less tired, because I could see another generation picking up the torch that us women have been trying to carry for all of these years, and for many people who lack a voice (our younger versions of ourselves and anyone who is marginalized). And we didn’t even ask for help, mainly because no one was listening. Not to mention the reality that we have to be stronger than everyone (or appear that way) to succeed on a “level” playing field.

Believe it or not, but the invention of the internet, digital technology and social media has at times distracted my own generation, as we are the first to try to be productive with all of this technology at our fingertips.

Then it finally hit me: This new generation is figuring out their purpose and how to mobilize their global voice for the betterment of the environment and their fellow humans. What? How? When? It’s like I blinked and saw a new world that isn't this giant mountain that I’ve been climbing since the first time I realized that I was being marginalized for being a female or a minority (or both). And instead of discouraging this behaviour based on my own (tired) energy, I’m going to sit up and listen and support these young future (and present Julia) leaders and soldiers as best as I can. 
So as whiny as I sound in stating all of the above, go get it Julia - I see you, and, at 19, I am already so proud of you and the people you have chosen to surround yourself with. Here’s to your achievements and your future successes. #dosomeinspiringshit

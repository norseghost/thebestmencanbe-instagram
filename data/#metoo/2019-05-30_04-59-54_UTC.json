It's embarrassing NOT to remember someone's name that I've worked with nearly everyday for 2 weeks. \nI mean I know it, but I can't pull the name to the front of my mind when I need it. Then 5 hours later it shows up when I don't.\nI hide it well...until I don't and lately my #dysautonomia, #erythromelalgia and #POTS is showing. \nI've been at this long enough to know that it's time for some lifestyle changes.\nGotta let the Google job go, delegate, set reminders AND family vacation starts Friday!!!\nAt least I know what to do earlier in the game than I use to. I like to keep the suffering and whining to a minimum. \nI know what I can control. \nBtw...my daughter has it too. That's the worst.\nDo you live with Chronic Illness?\nWhat do you hide well?\n\n#chronicpain #autoimmune #HardBeauty #thrive #selfmastery #warrior"

THE #METOO MOVEMENT AND ITS PORTRAYAL AND RECENT APPEARANCE IN NEW HORROR FILMS

The Me Too movement was created in relation to supporting others in speaking out against sexual assault. In became main stream after infamous Harvey Weinstein allegations and since then has been garnering more and more support from the masses. This movement has also been recently creating a splash in a rather unexpected genre... horror. It’s an important message being highlighted through increasingly creative methods. One such example is a new horror movie released by Netflix on May 24th of this year. This film follows the revenge plot of two violinists who were sexually abused by their instructor and follows their journey to confidence and then justice. This movie has resulted in controversy as some disagree with the way the message was portrayed. While some believe this movie was a great way to bring additional attention to an important issue, other believe this movie glorified the movie by turning it into a “rape revenge fantasy.” What do you believe?

Wow 2018, what a year in running you were:
âœ” 10K series age group winner
âœ” 10K series open female runner up
âœ” Marathon age group winner
âœ” Best sub 4 hour marathon improver
âœ”  Improver of the year
And I came out of 2018 feeling rotten about my running, thinking I was a failure. Why? Because I believed someone's hurtful words, always telling me I wasn't good enough. I'll be hanging these awards proudly now, not just as a reminder of my running achievements, but as a reminder to never listen to someone like that ever again. And if someone tells you you're not good enough, I hope you never, ever believe them. Take it from my example, those words aren't worth anything because they're wrong ðŸ’ª

Will India ever be a safe space for women and children anymore? Janani Viswanathan leads and is the co-creator of Project NoMoreNirbhaya in Chennai, India. No more Nirbhaya initiative aims to create safer public spaces for women. Their team teaches free self-defense sessions for school and college girls. Theyâ€™ve also conducted gender sensitivity training for bus drivers and conductors and safety audits to rate which parts of the city as safe or unsafe. 
She also works as a Crisis Counselor at Crisis Text Line- helping people in crisis over text and is an active domestic violence advocate at a South Asian organization based in Bay Area and a certified California Domestic Violence Survivor Counselor. She hopes more people will be encouraged to support organizations that are taking action to make India a safer place for all.

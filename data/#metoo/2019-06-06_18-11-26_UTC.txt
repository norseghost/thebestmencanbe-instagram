STORY TIME: 
one day i was waking through the woods’s on a cool saturday evening. it is part of my daily routine to go for walks. it always calms my nerves and helps me sleep better. this night was different than the rest though, as i was walking through the woods i couldn’t hear any birds chirping or animals scittering around. it was strange, like time was frozen, there wasn’t even any whisps of the wind i could hear through the trees. i was kinda scared, so i decided to head back to my home and call it a day. when i turned around and started to walk i heard a strange laugh, i thought maybe it was some animal, or even my imagination cause i was paranoid, so i shrugged it off. i walked a little faster now, hearing strange footsteps in my ears. i started jogging, now running, there was definitely someone behind me as i heard the panting and loud footsteps of a beast. i quickly glanced back as i saw a strange dark figure, glowing red eyes and a dark purple shirt with blood stains over it. my heart stopped, i kept running but i noticed my feet weren’t moving, i was frozen in place. my fear has struck me as i stared in the eyes of the beast. shivering in place, the creature had stomped up to me, looking over me it gives me a toothy grin. the creature leans in to my ear, i was frightened. it speaks ever so softly saying. “ he he.. motifa is here baby. have no fear my baby child.” this motifa creature backs up and goes 🙏🙏👊🙅🏻‍♀️🤙✋🤚👐🙌👍🤝 then flies of in a blast of hot fiery ash. as she soars into the sky i quickly glance up to get a look at her. she waves at me and vanishes beyond the atmosphere. at this moment i truly knew i’m fucking retarded. #story #storytime #meme #nahfr #metoo

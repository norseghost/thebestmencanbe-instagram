Mallard study🦆👀. A female mallard (front) has her own issues during mating season, and these males were being way to forthcoming... #metoo 
12x18” charcoal/chalk render with a bit of digital editing to put the separate pieces together! Had challenged myself on this one to complete each mallard as quick as possible. Time is 💰!!

the struggle to keep moving forward is real but some of the trauma will never be healed 😢

When she has trauma
✅ love her anyway!
.
▪️When her bouts of irrational rage over the tiniest things cause her to spin out of control
✅ love her anyway!
▪️When her sense of self worth becomes completely negative
✅ love her anyway!
▪️When her desire to overachieve but her near crippling depression causes her nearly always to miss the mark
✅ love her anyway!
▪️When her inability to remember the vast majority of her youth (including my childhood and adolescent years)
✅ love her anyway!
▪️When she is hyper focused and remembers any criticism
✅ love her anyway!
▪️When her hyper focus is on things that she deemed to be embarrassing
✅ love her anyway!
▪️When she feels instances of complete detachment from her thoughts and feelings
✅ love her anyway!
▪️When she has a overwhelming sense of shame and guilt that never seemed to leave her
✅ love her anyway!
▪️When she has skewed feelings towards her abuser; feeling grateful and familial towards them one moment and feeling extreme hatred for them the next
✅ love her anyway!
▪️When she has innate need to be alone all of the time because she was never able to trust anyone
✅ love her anyway!
▪️When she has complete sense of hopelessness and loss of interest in anything that seemed to grow daily
✅ love her anyway!
▪️When she feels totally unloveable
✅ love her anyway!

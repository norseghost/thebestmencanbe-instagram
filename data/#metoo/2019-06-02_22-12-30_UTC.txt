Today, I explored Downtown Phoenix with two amazing friends while sipping on cold brew and having bomb ass conversations. I count on the healing powers of crusin up coffee shops and galleries with a small group of friends/individuals.
-
I sat and thought to myself, How sometimes we forget to listen.
-
Here we are worried about leveling up that we often forget to be thankful for what we have in front of us. Those little instances with your friends in the present moment to simply be thankful for their existence, even if you just met them.
-
Checking in with someone and loving them right there in that present moment because sometimes, it isn‚Äôt always about you. It‚Äôs also about them, and their journey.
-
You see, every struggles. 
Everyone is human.
-
In the moments of being there for someone Have you ever taken the time to ask:
-
‚Äúdo you need me to sit here and listen or would you like me to give you some advice?‚Äù
-
To offer your hand if they need it or to simply sit still and feel it with them.
-
To remind them,
we can both do this. 
Together.
-
Thank you for an epic day üñ§

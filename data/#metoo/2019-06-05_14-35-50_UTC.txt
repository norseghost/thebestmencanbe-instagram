Hey friends! I really need your help..helping domestic violence survivors. 
In case you havenâ€™t heard, I am volunteering at The Chest Of Hope to help other survivors that are behind me on this healing journey.

They are opening their FIRST!!!!! Transitional house this month And they need help furnishing it. In the picture below youâ€™ll see their wishlist. They also created an Amazon wish list to make it easy for you to donate.  AND ITâ€™S TAX DEDUCTIBLE!!! ðŸŽ‰

Wondering why having a transitional home for survivors and their kids is a big deal? Because Chest Of Hope has found that when the survivors leave their abusive relationship they are put into a safe home. BUT often times they donâ€™t have the life skills to be able to get on their feet after they leave the safe house. 
The transitional home is not only a place for them and their kids to stay while they get on their feet, but they are put through a customized program to help them with the skills they are missing to be able to run an efficient household and hold a good job. 
Thank you in advance for helping me help other survivors.

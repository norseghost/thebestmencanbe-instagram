Hello my friends and Kamala supporters,

I hope this note finds you exceptionally well. 
I am absolutely elated to invite you to a PRIDE kickoff reception I am Co-Hosting with Senator Kamala Harris in San Francisco on Saturday, June 29, 2019 
I'm very excited that Kamala is running for President. Kamala Harris's message -- "For The People" -- is exactly right for this moment.

Kamala said on this day in 2015, the right of every American to marry the person they love was finally recognized. As we celebrate four years of marriage equality, let’s not forget the struggle for LGBTQ equality is far from over.

She is prioritizing one of the largest middle class tax cuts in history, health care for all, and reforming our broken criminal justice system. 
She has the experience to lead and is the best candidate to lead our party and prosecute the case against President Trump and the many ways he is failing our country in a general election.

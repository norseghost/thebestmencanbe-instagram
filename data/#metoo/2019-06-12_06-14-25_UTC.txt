I am still in the process of figuring out what I want this project to be, what kind of person I want you to get to know. As many, I struggle with accepting myself, with all ups and downs. There are days when I am absolutely content with myself, other days - I wonder whether I have any rights to even speak up. 
That helps me to realize that the best version I can introduce to you is raw, vulnerable me. You can choose what you want to read and who to follow. I have only myself, and all I can do is become more accepting and more open about who I really am. Otherwise, all the words, all the advice I share is absolutely worthless if they do not come from my heart and experience.

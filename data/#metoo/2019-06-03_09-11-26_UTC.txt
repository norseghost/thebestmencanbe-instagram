@aktalkies spent 6 months putting together a detailed account of the rise and fall of @allindiabakchod.  This granular account on AIB’s rise and fall is based on several months of reporting and interviews with @tanmaybhat, @mojorojo, @ashish_shakya and @gursimrankhamba, and 6 former AIB employees — four of whom are women. HuffPost India also reached out to Kukreja, and three more women who had worked with AIB, but they declined to comment.

The interviews suggest that the fall of AIB was consistent with the logic of the influencer economy: the forces that fuelled its stratospheric rise — Twitter, internet culture, virality and advertiser-driven growth — also propelled its rapid end.

On a darker note, AIB’s unravelling is an indictment of a moment where too many brands, corporations, business models, and influencers use the language of feminism to push products, promote themselves and make money, while begging off when asked to actually live up to the principles they espouse in their Insta stories.

Working all the time is not easy, not the goal, not ideal, sometimes even suffocating... but it’s also, always worth it, very rewarding, incredibly blessed, and pushes me out of my comfort zone every single day. 🛂 worked myself to the GROUND this week, + not always on my fave thing (@model_me) ... The focus this week is more peace, more @model_me work, more work with good people. Like the people yesterday on this shoot 🌝 love u guys a lot @nas_abraham @facesplaceslaces @noemieschelbert

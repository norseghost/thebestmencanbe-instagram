There are so many taboos in Indian society that do not let it prosper. The myths and practices related to menstruation top the list. We claim to be modern and open-minded but when it comes to discussing ‘periods’ in public, we shy away.
Why? Why does it have to be embarrassing? Why can’t we accept the fact that it is as natural as life itself? If a girl uses the word “period” instead of the most common code-words then she is judged by everybody! People judge her for being open about her hormonal activities.
What’s worse is the fact that even females give each other death stares if somebody uses the word “period” in front of males.
We, as a society, need to understand that without menstruation, there would be no child-birth. Periods is not a dirty word and they are natural. Let’s talk about it. Period.

Had to take a quick break these last Chemistry assignments are taking forever. It's not even hard just the quantity. Then I really need to get back to A&P I can't throw away over a years worth of hard work even though I am super drained. I  need a pep talk.  I  need someone physical here I can depend on.  Oh well back to the grind.

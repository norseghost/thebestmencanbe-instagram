On Tuesday evening, Justice for Lai Dai Han was joined by Nobel Peace Prize recipient, @nadia_murad_taha and other distinguished Parliamentary guests at Church House near Westminster for the unveiling of a statue honouring all victims of sexual violence, including the Lai Dai Han. 🗣 Nadia Murad said:
“In January of this year when I joined the survivors to support them, I was saddened because it took this long to recognise their sufferings. But at the same time I do understand because it is not easy for a woman to speak out and come forward about what happened to them when it comes to sexual violence”

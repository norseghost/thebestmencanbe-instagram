When I stand up for myself as a woman, I stand up for ALL wxmen

When Iâ€™m made to feel useless

When Iâ€™m made to feel helpless

When Iâ€™m backed into a corner because men still hold power over us

I will do my best to separate those feelings from affecting me as ONE woman

To affecting ALL wxmen

Then maybe Iâ€™ll feel strong enough to stand up to them

Maybe I wonâ€™t feel useless

Maybe I wonâ€™t feel helpless

Because Iâ€™ll be speaking up for every one of us

Every one of us that has to put up with catcalling

Who has to put up with being objectified

Who has to put up with feeling trapped

And I wonâ€™t feel so alone

Then maybe

Just maybe

If we all stick together

We will see change.

Sending love to every wxman just trying to get by every day. I see you and I feel you and Iâ€™m with you. ðŸ–¤

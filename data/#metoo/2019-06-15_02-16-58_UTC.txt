Rape and assault accusations are serious and should be treated as such, therefore if you are found to have falsely accused someone you should be severely punished and held responsible. That should be the standard for any hoax or abuse of resources, legal or public. A man is dead in Utah, beaten to death and the video evidence isn't supporting the assault story.

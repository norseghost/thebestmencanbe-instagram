It was incredible to work with this material and audition with the music of @alanis 🎶 🎸 🎹 #glenballard #jaggedlittlepillbroadway @jaggedmusical ... I forgot how poetic and empowering these words are; whether or not the paycheck hits my bank account - having the words “you took me out to wine, dine, sixty-nine me, but never heard a damn word I said” auditioning for #broadway pre #metoo movement.... #priceless @alanis, Girl- you broke the mold 💥 .

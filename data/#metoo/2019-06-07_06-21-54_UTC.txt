Privileged to see this advanced #screening of @thischangeseverythinghollywood . Did you know #female directors were once the norm during silent films before banking investments altered the industry in talkies? I am inspired...shocked, yet sadly not surprised about the data grounding the film and the gross accounts of #genderbias in the fiber of every bit of life and work...this #documentary about the need for change in Hollywood lays the responsibility squarely on each of us while inviting a new kind of #chivalry to rise from those who could be the greatest changemakers of all -- white men with hiring power.  There is enough work and opportunity for #inclusion #diversity ... let's aim for 50/50 (women/men) on screen and behind the camera! FX dared to change their predominantly male hiring norm and embrace more color and #women...and won more awards for quality content the following year. 
This film comes to theaters July 22nd!

I used to think the ugly things I had been through would be nothing more than secret skeletons in my closet.  Ashamed. Embarassed. Guilt ridden. Afraid.  Now, in my 30's I am realizing an incredible amount of women share my same secrets. Sometimes I wish I were braver. I wish I would have done something different. I wish I wouldn't have stayed so long. I wish that maybe I wouldn't have felt so alone.  So if my uglies can give the beauty of hope to someone out there, then I am here.  The shame isn't mine to carry.  The guilt and fear aren't my torches to hold.  And they aren't yours either. If you need help - I will do my best. If you need a friend to talk to - I am always here.  If you need to share your story to help you heal - you can do so anonymously.  You aren't alone. .

... still waiting on my apology
.

And I generally think white people are conditioned to get "ahead of themselves" from like, age 3, and if you couple the microagressional ridiculousness of institutionalized racism, black people just end up waiting around for white people to *think logically* about ... everything once you advance beyond high school
.

Like, why the fuck am I here? Oh, because white people hate my area of study, even though they accepted my area of study. Uninteresting
.

White issues of ego and control end up dictating the governing body of white trash liberal discourse. This is my education. I am a straight A student. I have open and warm relationships with all my professors. This is only about controlling the final output of my pending scholastic narrative
.

It's underwhelming
.

And this is particularly interesting bc NYU (responsibly) allows extreme-right narratives to flourish. I think it's wise, and the *core* of a democratic process to entertain bipartisanship. They only focus on me. Racist fuck offs
.

And this song reminds me of this boy, who refuses to talk to me... It isn't about this NYU fuckery
.

How cute is this little song? Very.

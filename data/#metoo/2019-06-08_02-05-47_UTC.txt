Healing is about to go down for men who have suffered in silence! Itâ€™s time for men to discover who they really are and take our rightful place in our homes, communities, and in our country! We are divorcing shame, abandoning the lies of the rejection and surrendering the hurt and trauma of the past and are fully embracing our healing!!! RSVP FOR Silenced!! because seats are already half filled!!!! #men #boys #trauma #mood #sports #silenced #Healing #MeToo #IAmMan #Manhood

While I was in Japan their labour minister publicly declared high heels to be “necessary” for women to wear in the workplace. This was his response to #kutoo , a play on words from the word “kutsu”, meaning shoes, and “kutsuu”, meaning “pain”. It is also a reference to the global #MeToo movement against sexual abuse. I think his declaration is fucked up. It is near-obligatory for women to have to wear heels when job hunting or working in many Japanese corporations. High heels can cause serious pain- some in Japan say this is akin to modern-day foot-binding... when I heard this I decided to go get myself some heels (okay they’re platforms but I gotta start somewhere). I’m amazed at what women go through to conform to society’s standards of acceptability and beauty. Fuck beauty standards and fuck the patriarchy. PS I’m over 6ft now and my back hurts like hell #kutoomovement #heels #platforms #fashion #patriarchy #matriarchy #highheels #japan #tokyo #🇯🇵 #workplace #genderequality #genderissues #beautystandards #equality

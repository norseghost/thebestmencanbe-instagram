Partner in crime 
I want you to be mine
You should touch my soul
Because its black like coal

There is a spark inside 
And if you reside
It's gonna glow
Like a Phoenix inside my soul

It'll rise
Like a spirit bird flies
But who am I to talk
Can't even sleep nor walk

So alone
I don't allow myself to miss home
Instead I keep moving 
Moving forward, moving backward
Standing still

Here is where I rest
Please give me a rest
I can't keep on going
It's like a circle, I'm glowing 
Like plasma in an exciter 
Though I don't feel lighter
How can I rise and shine 
When nothing seems to be mine

We are all lonely, together
All stuck in bad weather
Is there sunshine
Above the clouds?

Like friends being stars 
Always there for you
Above the clouds
Behind the moon

I see you every day
But I loose trust
Trust in myself 
Trust in the world

And the worst
I can't trust in men
Not anymore.

Sorry to share with you
But your touch scares me

More than anything.

I've been broken one too many times
How can I rise and shine

Again.

I can't even touch myself
Who is going to help?

There's a voice inside
Screaming for help
Here I am, waiting for it

I'm in the same place again
Loneliest person in a planetarium 
While I'm surrounded by love
I'm broken, not touched

Please stand by my side
Help me to rise.
Because there's a fire inside
Waiting to fight or flight 
It keeps me going 
It keeps me growing
Even in the darkest spot
Let's light it up

Be my partner in crime. ðŸ’š

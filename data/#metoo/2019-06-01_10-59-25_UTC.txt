Never underestimate the power of true unconditional love and its beautiful healing impacts.•

Three years ago is an anniversary date of being raped, beaten, gaslighted to an extreme by my ex-boyfriend and my very own family then jailed when I finally snapped out of it and called 911 for help in Belle Plaine, MN directly after the beating.•
•
Instead of receiving help as a battered woman in State of Minnesota I was funneled into a government process that was pure torture for me after all the assaults I had endured with not just this man but in my lifetime as well, as I am childhood abuse survivor too. The worst part was the corruption and learning about just how broken our system is and power imbalance that takes place today.• •
The pattern repeated itself.  Shocked? Not me, it is common for this pattern to persist when you have been victimized as a child.  As women, we typically become victims again, and again, and again until our social circle helps us through it.•
•
Learning how to identify the patterns of abuse is challenging for us survivors.  Especially after years of mental and emotional abuse in our early childhood development that shamed us to the point of near extinction more than once—we tend to live by feeling like we are burdens if we don’t give enough of ourselves to the other person or the world around us.•
•
The compounding trauma brought me to my knees and I wanted to hang myself like my sister before me, but I didn’t instead I fought for my life and I still rise and choose to live every single day—I also choose life and healing for you as I believe in the power of healing yourself best when we heal in safe, supportive communities with others who are on the journey of recovery and self-growth.•

Today, on June 1, 2019 I am who I am.  I am where I am on my healing journey and I am blessed to have this incredible four legged angel by my side and all the wonderful people who have never given up on me in my life.•
•
To all those who continue to believe in me and support me—I love you.  To all those who don’t, I love you anyways just kindly stand down and back off—I am healing and very sensitive.•

Trigger Alert : Sexual harassment. Please don't swipe if you would be affected or offended. 
This post is in context to the next few images on the carousel. I came across this post by @durgagawdestudio a few days ago and I was appalled and paralyzed in shock, disgust and fear to say the least. She had also posted an IGTV video about the same. I did not have the strength to watch it and exited. But the post left a lasting spell of worry and disgust and anger all at once. .

It's atrocious that women have to go through such inimical things everyday and nothing happens after the initial rant. The person that has undergone such unjust is filled with shame and fear while it should be the other way around. It's fortunate that she was brave enough to rebvolt against it and speak about it openly without shame.Cannot imagine the state of women who do not have the freedom or space to voice their trauma. .
.
This won't change until we collectively raise voice against it and protect our fellow beings. Change is imminent only if you stand up for yourself and also lift others in need. Please share this with as many people as you can and support the women around you protect them if they confide in you. .

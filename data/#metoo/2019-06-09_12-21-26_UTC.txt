An important part of the Inspire Show for me is to give a voice to those that don’t have the opportunity and for those that do, to share their vulnerability with the world. I think both will bring about inspiration and hope for improvement. Yesterday I was honoured to sit down with one of the leaders of the Hare Krishna movement, Anuttama das, to discuss the big issues spiritual and religious communities around the globe currently face and what they are trying to do to resolve them. As GBC for communications, I couldn’t have hoped for a better spokesperson then Anuttama das. More to come soon! Thank you.

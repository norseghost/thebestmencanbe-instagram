Historical Woman Strike in Switzerland 14 June 2019 🇨🇭✨🗽✨ Because Equality of Salary and procedures at work discriminate women and Swiss law is not applied by judges. Furthermore International and European Laws on violence and discrimination against women are not applied and respected in one of the richest country of the world! Strategic systems to discard women from being treated equally have been in place since Calvin, even in higher education such as Universities paid by our taxes = half by women!! Injustice is still prevailing: many harassment and criminal cases are going public after being silenced by heads of the system and policy-makers such as in Geneva...It is time for change in the Era of just balance for a better world...an irreversible movement 🌀☯️✨

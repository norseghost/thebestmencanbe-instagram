We’ve got a new episode of our podcast out today. @brandinico chats with a few songwriters of our latest single, “He Has Time,” and dive deep into the meaning of the song, the #MeToo Movement, the church & the importance of listening to victims of sexual abuse. Available wherever you get your podcasts, or at the link in our bio.

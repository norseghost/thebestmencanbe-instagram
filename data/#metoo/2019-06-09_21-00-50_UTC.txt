Hello lovely people of Instagram, wanted to introduce myself a little today. I am currently a stay at home mom. I have 2 lovely boys my dapper 10 yr boy here & my little hurricane of a 1 yr old. Husband is a Chief in the Navy. Very proud of him. San Diego is what I call home. After working all my life deciding to be a stay at home mom is a big change & something that took a lot of getting used to. Anyways... I love anything vintage & creative. I love my cultura Mexicana. I love working on a little of everything, currently have a crochet project going, card making & a million other new projects in mind. Iâ€™m a big nerd too so I love working on Harry Potter, LORD, GOT, AttackonTitan & sailor moon to name a few fandoms. Oh also if you follow my personal page I post my political views from time to time because #loveislove #blm #metoo. 
You will see how my life influences my crafts as I post more. Thanks for taking your time. 
XOXO
Jess

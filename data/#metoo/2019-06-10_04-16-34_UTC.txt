Had the unpleasant experience of viewing #theperfection earlier, and after a day’s worth of thought still have nothing positive to say about it. Pretentious, illogical, horribly written, poorly acted, and honestly insulting and frustrating as a viewer. Breaks every rule in the screenwriting playbook, and not in a good way. I tried to envision the creation and imagined a bunch of pseudo Hollywood intellectuals sitting around a whiteboard and throwing out random ideas that were “weird” and “shocking” and then trying to tie them into a cohesive story [unsuccessfully]. Not to mention the contradictory fact that it’s produced by #miramax and an alleged #rapist who then made a movie about rape while draining it of any poignant or meaningful message about female empowerment or feminism. There were moments I thought, “surely a 13 year old wrote this,” but no, three adults. I honestly can’t remember a more distasteful and literally ludicrous film trying to pass itself as artsy and intelligent. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen or heard so much repetitive dialogue (and horrible dialogue) in a script. If you stripped out the repeated lines and “reveals” you’d have a 20-minute short. It never finds its footing in tone and never really knows what it wants to be. The many “twists” are excuses to further a plot that doesn’t actually exist. I refute the people claiming this as feminist propaganda; it actually makes a mockery of #metoo by dismissing its significance as a scapegoat to make a “horror” film. The audience is owed an apology. 🤬🔪🎻🎼🤮#ridiculous #schlock #trash #pretentious #unpleasant #nothinggoodtosay #donotrecommend #awful #offended #dontquityourdayjob #wasteoftime #infuriating #opinionated

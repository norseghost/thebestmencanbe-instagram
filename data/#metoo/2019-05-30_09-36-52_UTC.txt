I'm trying to remember but I can't. I didn't grow up in a house that offered that type of comfort, love, and protection. We were taught resilience, strength and how to survive in this world. I imagine imagined how that looked and felt so I provided that environment to my daughter. 
I'm hard at work reparenting the inner child inside still wishing to be heard and seen. It still surprises me at time the stuff that lingers. Sexual abuse cast a horrible long shadow through our adult lives. Itâ€™s ok because I love my shadow too.

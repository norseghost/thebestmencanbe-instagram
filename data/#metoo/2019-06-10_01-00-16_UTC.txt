“Strength has several facets; it can mean being quiet, surrendering, or letting go of things. Strength isn't always just this raw charge moving forward. Sometimes, strength is realizing that you need to give yourself a rest day.” - @steph_gaudreau on @wellnessforce Radio episode 217 with host, @trent_sd.

Nearly done and time to decide what color to paint the edges of this canvas. The next step will be a love letter to accompany the piece. The portrait and love letter will hang side by side. The show this work will be a part of will be a celebration of people I loveâ€”a celebration of their vulnerability, strength, and resiliency. .

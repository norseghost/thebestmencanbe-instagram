Self-love and self-care are two concepts we as humans struggled with on a daily basis. How two of the most personal and intimate words doesn't occupied our first thoughts in the morning or at all through most of our lives?

Take a min, breathe, it is not selfish or careless to think in what you need, you don't have to live to cover anybody's expectations except your own. Once you are happy with yourself, everything else in your life will run smoothly and you will reach without a doubt your full potentialðŸŒ·

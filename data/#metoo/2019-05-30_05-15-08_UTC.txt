#AWLCCanada2019
.
Canada’s history has been shaped by countless determined women who worked to promote and uphold gender equality in Canada. Women championed a number of important human rights that have become core Canadian values like:
-the right to vote in provincial and federal elections, -the right to own property, -the right to earn a fair wage, and, the right to be recognized as “persons” under the law by the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

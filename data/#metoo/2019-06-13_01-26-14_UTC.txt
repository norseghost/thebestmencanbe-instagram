SARA staff Monica & Yolanda had the opportunity to attend the Latinas LEAD Power Summit hosted by the Latino Community Foundation of Colorado over the weekend

The Summit is an annual gathering designed to create a culturally relevant shared learning environment where Latinas can share their unique strengths, challenges and opportunities as they shape their professional and personal development.

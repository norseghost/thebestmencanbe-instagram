DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH STRENGTH IT TAKES TO FULLY EMBODY YOURSELF AS A WOMAN? A whole lot...
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Because for most of us, we carry old stories and wounds of the times when we were told we were:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
evil, unworthy, the creator of sin, crazy, wild, dangerous, tempestuous...
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
and then there was the other side of us that was: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
pure, loving, divine, gentle, sacred, demure, silent... and THIS PART WAS THE PART THAT STAYED VISIBLE.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But to me, only half of that story is true. And the other part was designed to keep us small, shut down, controlled and hurt.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you are a woman and you have ever felt: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
crazy
wrong for being who you are
emotional
split in two
broken
damaged
worthless
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Then listen to me, please.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
There is NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
And it is time to write a new story.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
To end the cycles of pain and the ignorance of truth and to step into a new role as a woman of importance, wisdom and strength.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
And if you are ready, I want to show you how. It's an active choice to no longer allow the old to run your life, and you slowly, gently create a new path forward where you are: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Strong
Wise
Beautiful
Sensual
Independent
Intelligent
Brilliant
Courageous
Emotionally Sound
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
And so much more.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Are you ready for this new version of yourself to emerge? I'd love to know your thoughts and feelings on this.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
XO, K ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

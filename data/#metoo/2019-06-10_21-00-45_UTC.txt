For those of us juggling mighty organizing demands with never enough time and resources...this could be one of the most valuable courses ever.⠀
⠀
Who this course is for: Anyone involved in progressive organizing who wants to get more done with less stress and more joyfulness in their personal or work life in 2019! Anyone who wants to find more effective ways to manage and work collaboratively with teams of leaders, volunteers or staff.⠀
⠀
Our bias is towards free and low-cost tools.⠀

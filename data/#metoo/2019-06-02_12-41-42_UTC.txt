🗣Ellen DeGeneres broke her silence as a teen who suffered by the hands of her step father for many years. Unfortunately her mother did not know how to respond, and Ellen continued to live with the abuse for many years. .

👩🏽‍🏫Prevention Education helps prepare parents with not only preventing the crime, but also knowing how to respond if their child discloses their abuse. Regrets is an emotion her mother will carry for many years. We are PROUD of @theellenshow for speaking out, and praying we can use her example as a motivation to become further educated. This crime happens to children, teens, and adults. Who will join me for my next workshop on Grooming by Sexual Perpetrators, and how to respond to Sexual Abuse disclosure coming soon.

“I’ve learned, I am worth protecting. The justice system did not show me that.” From It Is Not Your Crime ➡️ https://defendsurvivors.org/2018/01/03/it-is-not-your-crime/

Most every story you will see in the media ends with the perpetrator being in jail. But that is not what normally happens. The reality is that most child sexual abuse reports will not result in a conviction, prosecution, or even an arrest.
•
If the media reported on every report that did not result in an arrest, we would be inundated with these stories, and we would know the true scope of this problem.
•
The goal should not just be to get a child to tell or even to just be believed. The goal should be for every child to be believed AND protected AND defended the first time they tell.

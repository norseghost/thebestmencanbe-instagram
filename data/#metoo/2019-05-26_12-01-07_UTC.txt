One of the most harrowing examples of South Korean war crimes during the Vietnam conflict was the systematic and brutal mass rape of Vietnamese women and girls by South Korean troops. The 5,000 to 30,000 children born as a result of pregnancies caused by these rapes are derogatively referred to as “Lai Dai Han” in Vietnamese, meaning “mixed blood”. In a region where ethnic purity is held in high regard, the stigma of rape weighs heavy, a burden that has forced the Lai Dai Han to live as outcasts as they have been shunned in Vietnamese society for their perceived lack of racial purity. 🔎 Link in bio!

Oh my gosh was this by far my biggest nightmare. \nI\u2019ve learned now...and I\u2019ll share to give HOPE to others or even if you have kids what to look for...I\u2019ve learned now that I have all the markers in my blood work for \u201cPANDAS\u201d or \u201cPANS\u201d which means all those times I had strep throat that it went into my brain. It caused me to be Super OCD and I never told anyone bc I had nothing to compare it to but I chewed the same amount of each bite of food on both sides of my mouth before I would swallow each bite all through my childhood. I had high highs and low lows. I wouldn\u2019t wear shorts bc when I sat down they were uneven. I had to have everything even, if I didn\u2019t I would overreact...even if I didn\u2019t tell anyone and just overeact inside. I also zoned out all the time but would know everything being said. I\u2019ve learned this was repeated strep that went to my brain.\nAs a teen I suffered traumas and a life changing (brain changing) cheer accident from a basket toss stunt that left me homebound, in physical therapy, learning to walk again, back spasms, and doing class at home. The drs said I would never dance again...I\u2019m strong willed and I was determined to prove them wrong\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\nAfter this w added trauma I developed ADD and depression. I attempted suicide at 17 after rape and injury etc. I ended up in a dark and then darker place. I put my all into helping and loving others bc I didn\u2019t love me. I went to therapy,counseling, got on many high dose psych meds etc. one of the meds gave me intrusive thoughts and psychosis...my first experience w that.\nAs an adult I got off meds for psych bc of so many side affects and was determined to do things naturally. By this point I learned self talk helped a lot...eating clean..exercise..making myself be around others when I wanted to isolate..lots of time w God and letting Him heal my hurt..etc. continued in 2 comments"

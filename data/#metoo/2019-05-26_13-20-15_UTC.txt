SO DO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM IF WOMEN GO HOME LATE? “...because I get paid less, I have to  work for same hours, and I have to deal with the pink taxes for daily essentials. Haneee, many women are the victim for domestic violence and poverty. Due to those facts, I need to get an education, work much harder, and hold my self accountable to be able live independently. Woman’s vagina is not that alarming like your genitals, gents and it doesn’t move with the speed of privilege. So, I need to appreciate my self more”. The narration is made as a methaphor for the 21st century women’s movement. Nothing to objectify any women in that regards.

The very first film I was ever cast in was finally completed as its own short and can be seen at the link in my bio! Even though it was filmed four years ago, the topic of rape culture is obviously still prevalent today. Grateful to have been a part of such an important project and to have worked with an incredible director who made me feel comfortable throughout the entire filming process. 🙌🏼

🎥 “Behind the Scenes” Fact 🎬
We were filming in an alley around the corner from the Sheridan redline stop in Chicago, and during one of the takes where my scene partner has me pushed up against the wall, a guy who was walking past ran up and demanded to know what was going on because he thought something awful was happening. We told him it was for a film and he only relented after I personally assured him that I was okay and that it was indeed part of a film project. I always think back to that man and am so grateful he spoke up and stepped in when he saw something that didn’t look right...it’s wonderful to know there are people like that in the world. Now more than ever, men need to step up and support women in our fight for dignity and equal rights.

So without further ado, please enjoy “If The Knife Fits.”

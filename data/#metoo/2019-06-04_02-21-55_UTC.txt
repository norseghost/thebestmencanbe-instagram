Hi friends, so many new faces on here.
I wanted to take the time to introduce myself to all my new friends that I have noticed joined the #VulnerabilityTrain 🚞

My name is Dez Ramirez & I am a huge advocate for vulnerability & healing.
I am a sexual assault advocate & storyteller 
Who also has a podcast #BecomingRamirez (Click link in bio ) 🎙 
However that is not what I anticipated I would ever be at 26yrs young. I actually went to CSUSB to become a publicist/ media personality 🙂

Wildly enough that landed me a career in creative directing on sets for fashion brands in LA. 👍🏾 After a year, of working for fast fashion brands I discovered I wasn’t really digging the ethics of how garments were being produced. Which later gave me the courage to become my own boss & copartner with my mentor to launch a media agency💻 📽

We had several clients but not enough man power so we decided it’s best to close shop for our own sanity (& our pockets 💸) By 2017 i began managing many bloggers, influencers, & brand accounts as their content creator & social media strategist 📱 
Just when I thought I had finally achieved a steady income as an entrepreneur.... my life too a drastic turn! ⚠️TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ I was followed home 1 night after celebrating with coworkers at a concert & a man  deliberately followed me & struck the back of my vehicle 🚗  on the freeway 🛣 
I got out to see if everything was okay.
What happened next lead to me running half naked on the road screaming for help. 
I was sexually assaulted, strangled, stripped & robbed 💔

It was a very horrific year of recovery.
I chose to take back my power & life by first....
Unpacking the trauma.

This lead to 2.5 years of intensive therapy.
(Still holding strong 💪🏽 w/therapy)  I began educating myself on the aftermath of trauma victims & I realized how HUGE this is to the well-being of ones mental & emotional wellness 🧠 
I made a vow to myself that I would turn my •Pain to Purpose •Tragedy to Triumph
•Mess into a Message
•Vulnerability into Empathy ♥️
I appreciate each & everyone of you who have dm me & shared your story with me & I BELIEVE YOU!
Introduce yourself 👇🏽 I would love to get to know you!

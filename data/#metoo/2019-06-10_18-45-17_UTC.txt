@wholetruthfilm has been my dream for 8 months and now it’s happening. This journey has been fulfilling, terrifying, stressful, challenging and so so joyful. Producing, writing and acting is a lot. But I can’t wait for the world to see this movie. I’m already so proud of it. But it is bigger than me. Survivors, this film is for us- honest, hopeful, strong and empowering. 💪 The biggest thanks must go to @yelitagram for leading this vision with me (and keeping me sane the last few months). And to the whole of the *all female cast and crew* who are helping to bring this dream to life- you’re the best in the biz💜 | ➡️ for @imdb and @film_local press release- full imdb link in my bio and press release in the film’s bio.

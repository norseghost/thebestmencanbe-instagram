In 2 Samuel 11-12 we find David’s infamous sin with Bathsheba and subsequent train wreck. In light of #metoo, sexual exploitation,  misogyny, and the misuse of power, how in the world could David be called a man after God’s own heart? 
Though he paid a high price for his sin, the answer is found what he did next. Read Psalm 51. "God has never turned His back on a broken and contrite spirit–a person humbled before Him. This is what it means to be a man or woman after God’s own heart." –Dr. Jeff Warren

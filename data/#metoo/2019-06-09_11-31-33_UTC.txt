Sometimes I wish I could turn back time, even if it was only for a minute. 
To remember what my life was like before any of this. 
To know what it is not to worry and to not be scared.
This little girl had no idea what life had planned for her. She didn’t know how strong she was, until being strong was the only thing she had left. 
So grateful I have such happy and loving memories to hold onto throughout the dark times! ⭐️💫 #metoo #metoomovement

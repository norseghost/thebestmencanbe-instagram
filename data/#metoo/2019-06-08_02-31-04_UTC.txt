Continuing my last post. So the #dykemarch has banned the Star of David (“Jewish” stars) from their march. For literally no reason. This is VERY antisemitic and makes Jewish people feel targeted and unwelcome. This is 2019 people. Everyone please dm me asking what you can do to help, this is very serious. The banning means that basically Jewish people aren’t allowed to be openly Jewish, I can’t stress how important this is because a lot of people don’t pay attention to antisemitism. -Peyt

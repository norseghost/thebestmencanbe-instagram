Grounding by the river for disassociation, derealization, depression and anxiety. This is Day 172 in benzo withdrawal from Valium and I am still healing from this iatrogenic brain injury. Walking engages bilateral stimulation which can help to calm your body and mind when it is in a state of stress. Walking has probably been one of the number one things helping me to get through this withdrawal. Even if it is just a small walk out to the mailbox and back it helps to reset the mind and ease symptoms a bit. ‚úåüèº

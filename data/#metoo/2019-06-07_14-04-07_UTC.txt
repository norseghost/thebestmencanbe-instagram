Are you a Feminist? ✊🏻✊🏽✊🏿 More than half of Millennial Women don't identify as feminist, poll finds. 😲

The survey, carried out by Refinery29 and CBS News, asked 2,093 women about their sociopolitical views.

A staggering 54 per cent of young women in the US responded they they do not consider themselves proponents of the movement for gender equality whereas 46 per cent said they did identify as “feminist”. Despite the high number of women saying they do not call themselves feminists, 53 per cent of respondents said that they felt the Trump administration's policies had mostly hurt women while 70 per cent felt their individual rights and liberties were currently under threat.

You are not a bad person for surviving, for coping, and for trying to kill your sadness. You deserve to be happy. .
.
 Abuse survivors don't know how to live without being abused and controlled. We have to learn how to live differently, often without any help or guidance. We are hurt, broken, sad, depressed, anxious, and scared, just to name a few. Our fears are real. We are confused and unsure how to heal, or that healing is even possible. .
.
Unhealthy coping mechanisms are hard to give up because they are all we've known and they're what kept us safe and alive. We may act in ways that seem extreme, but we are unsure of ourselves and the world around us. .
.
Please be patient and kind. Kindness is never anything we've had before and we may not know how to react to it. .

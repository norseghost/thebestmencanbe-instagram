#keepingitreal
Contrary to what people seem to know about me being always fun and happy. Truth is, my days aren't always filled with sunshine. I have moments of sadness, insecurity, and worry. Sometimes I just wanna lie on my bed, do nothing, and let the day pass by. There are also times I am up and awake 'til four in the morning because of anxiety. And yeah, I go through some sh*tty days too. 
But I believe all of those are okay. It's a reality that life is not always smooth sailing. I just choose to #keepgoing. 😊

PS Let's be real and avoid putting on a facade. For better #mentalhealth 😉🙏
PPS I also want #worldpeace . Char Hehehehe

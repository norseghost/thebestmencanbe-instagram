Around this time last year, my depression was pretty low again... Wasn't as low as its ever been but it was still really low. I was going through alot both mentally, physically and emotionally. I was facing a loss; a broken heart; unemployment; and there were nights I'd cry myself to sleep or drink to numb my thoughts and feelings. I wasn't happy but tried my best regardless. Things only got worse and stayed really bad for a while but I recently got out of it and it's amazing what ONE year can do to you. How much stuff a person can face that will break them down or build them back up again. Life isn't easy and nothing worth having in life comes easily, but I'm telling you; if you're going through some really hard stuff please keep fighting. Don't give up. I know it seems like it'll never get any better right now, but it will. You just need to stay strong and keep pushing to see the better side of it. All the hardships you're facing now will either make you stronger or knock you back down. It's up to you to decide.

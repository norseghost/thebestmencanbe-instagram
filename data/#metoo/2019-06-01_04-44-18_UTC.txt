You see? This picture right here is speaking volumes.  Little things that we don’t bother have the power to completely overwhelm us. And what may be a minor irritation for some can easily send you into a panic or reduce you to tears.
Today I’m going to talk about a very sensitive, current serious issue in our society. That’s “Harassment”. 🌟Harassment covers a wide range of behaviors of an offensive nature. Wether physical, verbal, written, or any thing that is unwanted and unwelcomed and can offend or humiliate an individual.
Harassment is commonly taken in a physical sense. But it can be of any kind. Like verbal, personal, psychological, cyber bullying, sexual etc..
➖Infact sending Good morning texts to a women is also a harassment. & so much so if someone is constantly asking u for a cup of coffee thats also a kind of harassment. Also this could be abusive comments or jokes, graffiti or insulting gestures.
➡️And one more thing most of people, when they think of harassment , their mind immediately jumps to an image of a woman being harassed or propositioned by a male coworker, supervisor or boss. Both genders are being effected by harassment. 🌟what harassment does? It is so toxic to mental & physical health. Survivors of sexual assault experience a wide range of reactions. Like Shock and numbness, loss of Control, fear, guilt & self blame, isolation, distrust, sexual fears, Anger etc..
🌟What can we do to stop ✋🏻 this? 🔺Speak up, tell them that u are not okay with it. 🔺Donot delay. 🔹 Don’t wait to seek help. 🔹Share with your friends and family don’t hide this anymore.
🔸 You should file a case against them.
🌟As it is said that “Little drops of water make a mighty ocean”
So from today onwards let’s promise each other to pay our part in elimination of this “harassment”. 🙂 ✌🏻 #metoo #timesup #believesurvivors #whyididntreport #harassment #tothegirls #harassment #whyistayed #heforshe #imwithher #nevergiveup #speakyourselftour

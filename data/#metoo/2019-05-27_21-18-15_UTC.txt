this week I’ve been triggered over everything. certain smells, songs, conversations, noises etc have taken me to some of my fondest memories and some of my sweetest foundations.
.
I’ve also been reminded of the times in my life where I was left to be on my own; comfortable or not, and learning to fight on my own.
.
I’m finally finding my footing and when I reflect on that girl who used to be encompassed by grief and sadness, I’m grateful that I’m finding empowerment and strength through solitude.
.
I remember times when I was 16, scared, alone, isolated and willing the world to show me my purpose here. At almost 30 I’m so sad for that girl who thought she needed to have it figured out. I still don’t and getting more comfortable with the unknown.
.
I knew no matter what I wanted to find a life protecting others. I’ve had so many affirmations that it’s working, it’s growing, and people are finding comfort in areas I’ve given energy.
.
but it’s also been a debilitating week understanding and accepting that I’ve been bred to take care of myself, rely on myself, and shut down when someone interferes. This week I started to see independence as a super power, not as something to fear.  I’m  proud to see others standing up for themselves, the ones they love, and who they want to protect.

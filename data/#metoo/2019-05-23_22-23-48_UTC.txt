We live in a world that believes that women must prove their worth to be accepted, women need permission to be glorious human beings, women need menâ€™s approval to be heard or seen, and that survivors should be shamed because they somehow brought the pain to themselves. Oh, but my sisters, this couldnâ€™t be further from the truth! The world can do its best to attempt to stifle our voices so that we are too afraid to speak our truthsâ€”stories that illuminate the secret sins of attackers that flourish in the limelight of power. But our truths are now gaining strength, as we rise together and empower one another! Our voices are becoming bolder, as we stand together and fight for our rights! Our future is brighter than ever, as we bloom exactly where we are planted and lean on our sisters as we climb to higher heights! Sisters, our time is now! ðŸŒºâœ¨ðŸŒ¸ðŸ’š #timesup #strongertogether #belikethelotus #sisterhoodofsurvival #sisterhood #survival #metoo #womenempowerment #womenempoweringwomen #bloomwhereyouareplanted

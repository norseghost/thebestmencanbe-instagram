"Keep Sweet" was a phrase used by FLDS Cult Leader and convicted rapist/pedophile,  Warren Jeffs and his father, Rulon, to remind women and girls of their place.  Swallow your pride, swallow your emotions. Suffer silently regardless of what concerns you might have. Don’t show any emotion, don’t rock the boat, don’t make any trouble, don’t ask questions, don’t criticize, don’t find fault. Girls should accept the polygamist lifestyle and the men's wishes without complaint. Don't flinch when you're told to do something that doesn't quite feel right. Just be nice, don't complain because complaining disturbs the spirit of god.  In other words, "Keep Sweet".

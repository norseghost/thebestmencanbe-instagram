I can’t believe the second to last episode of season one was released last week! 
How many of you have tuned into episode 12 to hear my convo with former Assistant Secretary of State, Patricia Diaz Dennis on women’s roles in the patriarchy? If not, you can tune in on Spotify, iTunes, and Google Play. 
Stay tuned for the last episode of season one with astrologer and intuitive healer, @iamdaniellepage next week! #beabadass #podcast #girlpower #womeninbusiness #womenintech #ceo #womenempowerment #womenentrepreneurs #womensupportingwomen #womeninbiz #feminism #feminist #metoo #timesup #womenempowweringwomen #girlbosssa #girlboss #girlbossparty #savvybusinessowner #risingtidesociety #communityovercompetition #bandogirlgang #dontquityourdaydream #flashesofdelight #entrepreneurlifestyle #theeverydayproject #creativepreneur

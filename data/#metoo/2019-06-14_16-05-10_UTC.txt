Share & Discuss: How do you think the #MeToo Movement has impacted RISE at a local level?
.
Theresa Mortilla, RISE Clinical Director, shares what she's seen: "The growing need for services after #MeToo has increased the demand on RISE counseling services. In the last year we have hired several new therapists, but our average wait time to see a counselor is still 3 months. We currently have over 90 survivors on our waitlist, and not being able to talk to a therapist in a timely manner can be very discouraging."
.
That's why we're asking for your help to raise $20,000 by June 30 to support local survivors. Please consider donating today at RISEslo.org (link in bio).

                        "text": "HOW TO SAY NO continued:\n.\n1. Practice! Start with people you know well and situations that are low-stress (like going out to eat, deciding on a movie, etc.) try saying no to simple things even when you want to say just to practice having that conversation. .\n2. Choose friends that respect your boundaries. That way you won\u2019t have to keep explaining yourself and it minimizes the # of times you have to say no. Plus, are they really your friend if they can\u2019t take a no?\n.\n3. Work on body language. Shoulders back, eyes straight and that \u201cdon\u2019t mess with me\u201d face. This is the one thing that impacts instances of sexual abuse - not clothing, looks, make up, or anything else. (This doesn\u2019t mean anyone is \u201casking for it\u201d; just that body language can act as armor if we practice) My therapist says to think of putting a forcefield around yourself before you go out\n.\n4. Remember you are not responsible for their reaction. Focus on feeling safe and respected rather than being \u201cnice.\u201d If they freak out, it\u2019s on them, not on you. If it\u2019s a stranger, you\u2019ll never have to see them again! And if not\n.\n5. It\u2019s okay to talk about things after the fact. Sometimes it\u2019s still hard to think of a response on the fly and it\u2019s okay to explain later that you have some boundaries you\u2019d like respected. If it\u2019s a genuine friend that you want to have a long relationship with, this conversation is an investment into your friendship\n.\n6. Put things in perspective. Other people may try to make it seem like whatever we\u2019re saying \u201cno\u201d to is the end of the world, but remember they also have a life! People can be happy and productive humans with or without that thing that they absolutely need us to do\n.\n7. Simple is better. Use as few words as possible and don\u2019t explain yourself. Over explaining can make you seem like you\u2019re unsure of your decision\n.\n8. Repeat as needed! If someone keeps asking the same question, don\u2019t be afraid to repeat the same answer\n.\nanything I\u2019m forgetting that helps you?"

The breddah lucky he has this video cah they was gonna Central Park 5 him to bez and cees. Was going the way of Emmit Till, Shawn Coalman and Brian Banks...it wasnt looking good in the court of #MeToo and public opinion you guilty before proven innocent....especially when your young gifted and a few drops of melanin up the scale... dont ask me just ask Chris Breezy. They was writing headlines before he even got to court. #DontAtMe 
Glad for him anyway. Cant stand his diving around and ting but bigger than that glad he caught her in her little plan

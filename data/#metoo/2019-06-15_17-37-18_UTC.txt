SO TRUE.
Society conditions women to view each other as competition and often the only time we're able to to drop our guard ( and our bullshit) are the drunken moments in the ladies room. No one is more kind, loving, and supportive than the 1 am bathroom Oracles. 
Let's bring that vibe into our everyday, without needing the drinks. Ladies, and i mean ALL WOMXN, be who we are meant 
to be to ourselves and to each other before the world told us we couldn't.

Throwback Thursday to our 2018 Walk a Mile in Her Shoes. The International Menâ€™s March to Stop Rape, Sexual Assault, and Gender Violence was created in 2001. What started out as a small group of men daring to totter around a park has grown to become a world-wide movement with tens of thousands of men raising millions of dollars for local rape crisis centers, domestic violence shelters, and related education & prevention programs. There is an old saying: "You can't really understand another person's experience until you've walked a mile in their shoes." Walk a Mile in Her Shoes asks men to literally walk one mile in women's high-heeled shoes.
It's not easy walking in these shoes, but it's fun and it gets the community to talk about something that's really difficult to talk about: sexual and domestic violence. *** Interested in walking or becoming a sponsor this year? Keep an eye out for our save the date information. Everyone is invited to join on Thursday, September 26th. You can expect delicious food and outstanding raffle prizes! Registration opens at 4:30.

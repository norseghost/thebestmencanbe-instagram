🥋Learn how to fall with grace because you can't continue showing up for yourself if you get injured by every setback. ---
[Figuratively Speaking😉] When we learn how to fail and how to fall in life, we give ourselves the opportunity to receive powerful lessons and we absorb the strength of that which knocked us down in the first place so that, like a phoenix, we rise rise from the ashes...stronger...wiser...and in greater alignment with our truth.⚡ 🔥🦋🌻

☯️Ukemi (falling well in Judo) comes from the root verb ukeru, “to receive.”It becomes a method of investigating the harmonious resolution of conflict.

I have so much planned for you all over the next few months. Without giving anything away, let’s just say don’t get too comfortable with this #aesthetic . Call this project a graduation, we’re closing a big chapter of my life and moving on to bigger, better things 🤙🏻 stay tuned. Can’t wait to share this story, this journey, and the MUSIC with all of you soon 🖤

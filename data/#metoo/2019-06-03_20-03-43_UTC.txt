Sometimes the words we cling to are the ones that hurt us the most. Ones that someone else impressed upon us. Words that we have had to work really hard to change within our inner dialogue. 
Sometimes the power of words breaks us, crushes us, but we CAN shift those words. We can shatter those words that do NOT serve us. We can overcome the harm that others have inflicted upon us. 
And oh what a powerful moment that is. <3

Her words:
*edit to say I HAVE DECIDED TO MAKE THIS PUBLIC. SHARE THE HECK OUT OF IT!!!! SOMEONE YOU KNOW NEEDS TO SEE THIS!!** LADIES. If you look at anything LOOK AT THIS. 
I did this photo shoot to help not only me. 
I did this to be a voice. A voice for the voiceless. 
Listen. 
I was once a little girl. 
Innocence stolen. Believing LIES that were impressed upon me.. And I grew into a woman believing those same damaging lies. 
Are you there!? Please. 
Look. Listen. 
What has been done to you- does not define you. 
What he said- could never be true. 
What they did- is NOT your fault. 
That man does not own me. 
And honey he doesn't own YOU. 
Break those lies. Reclaim your freedom. 
Let these pictures. My vulnerability-be of some purpose. 
Believe me.

You are a beautiful. STRONG. Warrior. 
So now, go through these photos. And for a moment. Live through me. And imagine yourself breaking those words down.. Own yourself. 
Love yourself. 
Be yourself. 
Major thanks to LK Photography and Lona K Mason for such an amazing emotional experience. Hit her up. It may just change your life <3

Ongoing learning is vital when working in the field of trauma, resilience, and body-based practices. Annie Kiel, Fireflyâ€™s Executive Director, is thrilled to be back in Boston, catching up with colleagues, and brainstorming ways to incorporate key learnings into our work. Major highlight from today was listening to the founder of the Me Too movement, @taranajaneen - truly bold, inspiring, and change-making woman. #hero .

If we continue to stay quite, too timid to utter the *dirty* word “abortion”, we’ll never stop being so damn afraid of it. It’s time to speak out and scream ABORTION loud and proud. We deserve to be vocal and we have a right to inspire others to share their stories, too. ✨

So fuck the fear. Walk right into It instead. That’s the only way to change the collective story we tell ourselves about abortion and about a women’s right to choose.

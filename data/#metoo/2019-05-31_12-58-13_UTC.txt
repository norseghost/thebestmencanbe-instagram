Sexual abuse
Physical abuse
Emotional abuse 
None of this is okay. My name is Tegan Whipple and I am 21 years old. I suffer with depression, anxiety, stress, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) all of which I got after two of the three things listed above happened to me. 
How do I continue to go on? I don’t, I cry myself to sleep every night, I think about harming myself, which I do, I make plans to run away like buying a plane ticket to run away from what I’m going through, at this very moment in time I have a bag with clothes packed I want to go somewhere other then Sydney I want to disappear for a while and figure out who I am and what I want in life. 2 years ago my life changed drastically and everyday since I have thought about what happened and I always blame myself even tho people tell me not to and that it wasn’t my fault, but I still feel like it is. I am numb inside and feel empty and I don’t know why I am still here but I am. I feel like a coward because I can’t muster up the strength to end it, but I also know that I am strong because even tho I feel this way I am still fighting every day to stay alive and be there for my friends and family, and I want to be here when my nephew is born.
I feel lonely even tho I’m never alone.
People always talk about heaven and hell and if there even is one, for me I know there is a hell because I am living in it. My life is my hell and I can’t seem to escape it. 
Before anyone decides to rape, hit or abuse anyone in any way shape or form, just think, what would you do if that happened to your child, would you let it to continue happening or would you stand against it and do anything you could in order to protect them?

ðŸ’œThis week's #AwarenessWednesday spotlight is on Gyrl Wonder (@gyrlwonder), an NPO dedicated to provide and cultivate resources that teach girls how to leverage those tools to facilitate their personal and professional goals. "Young women are the vehicles of hope for our futures and it is up to us to ensure that our Gyrls are certain of what they can accomplish individually and collectively and that every dream can be conquered." Their inspiring program targets forward thinking young women seeking to explore their purpose through mentorship and objective alignment. Find out how you can support their fantastic work HERE: gyrlwonder.org

Thanking the beautiful @taranajaneen for her work in fighting to end the epidemic of sexual violence in the US. We discussed how physicians are often first responders in sexual violence cases & what we can do to shift the culture around a disease that is plaguing our communities. 1 in 3 women have been victims of sexual violence/abuse at some point in their lives & this won’t change until we change the culture & society we live in to a safer & more protective one for women & girls everywhere. We have a long way to go in this fight but with movements like @metoomvmt; the bravery of survivors who share their stories & the men & women that ally around them, there is hope for a brighter future 💫🌟

Like @oprah said, “And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say, ‘Me too’ again.”

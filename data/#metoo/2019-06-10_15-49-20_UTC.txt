#Lolita #actress #SueLyon as photographed by @stanleykubrick himself.
Based on the controversial novel by #VladimirNabokov and adapted by the novelist, it features an obsessive inappropriate relationship between a middle-aged man (James Mason) and a teenager Lolita.
Lyon was a mere 14 at the time the film was shot - upping the age of the character slightly from the 12 of the novel.
Many still feel the #book should be banned and the film was subject to much scrutiny and #censorship.
Released 57 years ago this week (13 June 1962) we'll no doubt be talking about the novel at our #BurnAllBooks event on Wednesday at the #BelfastBookFestival.

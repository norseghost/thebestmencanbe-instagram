My “He”ART”: HE/She, sHe/Male & all that good good stuff!”
Lovers have you ever dated or are with an individual that is the same sex gender as you? wheither they are Femme, butch however you represent yourself (LGBTQ) how about those who label themselves (officially) as Males, but you know deep inside you have a bit more testosterone tendencies than them (can be in the LBGTQ community or non LGBTQ) it can be really challenging! 🧿Spirit advice: “Take a sad Song & make it better!” 😑 Ugh WTF, I did have a hard time with that advice, because yes I’ve dated both & YES I’m a femme but have more male tendencies & for those who don’t understand that, I’ll explain.. I act & feel inside as a Man, its challenging, but in a relationship there has to be a Ying & a Yang (a give & take) you can’t expect one individual to do all the “❤️ loving work” I thought this spread was AWESOME 😎 because, not only does it show gender similarities but how to give in or part-take with a Lover that is “almost” your same reflection my Loved ones!-Jo Offduty (links below if interested in either of these decks!)

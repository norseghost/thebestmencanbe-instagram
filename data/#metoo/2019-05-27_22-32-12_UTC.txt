Saint Ursula: She didnâ€™t want to forsake her faith and marry Atila the Hun, when she ran into him on her way to Rome in the year of our lord 412AD. Atila, compensating for a clear case of small dick complex, made sure Ursula and all her company had a very bad day by killing them all.
After having been shopped around like a trophy of virtue amongst archbishops and nobles for a couple of centuries, she was finally laid to rest, sort of, in Toledo Cathedral under the main altar, essentially a pile of gold, where you can see her bare bones #metoo #sainthood #gothic #cathedral #spain #toledo

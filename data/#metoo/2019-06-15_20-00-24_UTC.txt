Wearing my mantra right on my sleeve today! Please check out the @youniquefoundation and consider donating to their work if you are able. This incredible organization advocates and supports survivors of childhood abuse, and organizes a monthly retreat where survivors can come together for a healing weekend...absolutely free of charge. I'm dedicated to supporting this mission and advocating for survivors is a lifelong passion of mine - I myself am a survivor of sexual assault. I'll drop a link in my bio so you can read more about this wonderful organization! ðŸ’œ #youniquefoundation #believesurvivors #metoo #uplift #empower #validate

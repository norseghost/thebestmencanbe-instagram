                        "text": "TBT. One year ago today, I did the photo shoot for my book cover and web site. Over the last year, I have often thought, was it all worth it? The resounding answer is yes. So many things were going through my head and heart that day. The release of the book was right around the corner and, soon enough, the world at large would see the real me. I consistently wear my heart on my sleeve, and I give my all in every relationship I\u2019ve ever had - and, I knew that pulling back the blinders and revealing the truth was going to make me lose people. I am grateful for the people who stayed true and those I gained. I have often been told I give too much, I am too much, and I share too much. My take is that we all have shit we go through in life - and, it is often easier to deal with when you\u2019re able to share your awful experiences with others that have had similar sadness and hurt. All life's joy and sorrow is more beautiful when shared. I\u2019ve had so many people reach out to me in the last year with similar life stories and their own heartaches that this crazy world has inflicted upon them. In each message, they thank me for being willing to be this authentic and honest - and, each time I am reminded that all the apprehension, anxiety and questioning was worth it all. Thank you all for your open hearts and minds and embracing all of me. \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd And thank you to my love, Paul, for being consistently supportive and loving me through all of it.\n\n#tbt #author #thelotus #howibeatthepatriarchy #embraceyourtruth #inspireothers #truechristianity #authorlife #smashthepatriarchy #patriarchy #abuseisnotlove #abusesurvivor #sexualabuse #physicalabuse #mentalabuse #metoo #abuseisnotok #equalityforall #empoweredwoman  #empoweringwomen #empoweredwomenempowerwomen #tbt #throwbackthursday"

Walking to work, a man felt the need to tell me “you should smile honey.” What. The. Fuck!! When are men going to stop telling women what to do, with our bodies, our minds, our spirituality, basically everything!  Told him to go fuck himself and mind his business.  His response, “cunt”. Nice. I don’t need to be polite, (some) men need to know their place. The #futureisfemale and that man’s behavior is no longer acceptable.  This song goes out to all the men who think they can tell a woman what to do.  #halseynightmare @iamhalsey .

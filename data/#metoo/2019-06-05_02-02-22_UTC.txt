Life was easier hiding behind a mask. I could be who people wanted me to be. I was accepted and fit in with most crowds. Life was simple, uncomplicated and boring. Whoever said an easy life meant a happy life was wrong.

Easy meant being complacent and compliant. It meant missed opportunities and regrets. It meant living a life that wasnâ€™t my own and empty. I had to make a choice to either take the easy path and hide or take the mask off and let the world see the real me.

This fierce chick is my alter ego. She doesnâ€™t care what people think of her. She always plays by her own rules and takes risks. Sheâ€™s fearless to the core and as tough as nails. She doesnâ€™t need anyoneâ€™s approval and never apologizes for fighting for what she believes in. She always cheering for the underdog and stands up to inequality and injustice. She can be brave and afraid at the same time, but doesnâ€™t let that stop her. Real Women Talks meet Natasha.

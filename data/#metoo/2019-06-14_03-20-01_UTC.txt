Today marks two years since I finally found the courage to take my babies and leave my abusive ex of 17 years and I feel amazing! When I left him I was scared, physically and emotionally drained to the point I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, I was weak and so depressed I was living life on auto pilot.  I’ve spent the past two years finding myself and learning to love myself again. I have worked on both my mental and physical health and just yesterday was told by my Dr that I am the healthiest he has seen me in years! I have found hobbies and interests, a great circle of friends and an amazing partner who treats me with the love and respect I deserve. I have my own home, my bills are paid, my kids have everything they need and plenty that they want, I’ve traveled to Mexico, Windsor and did a day trip in Detroit, my kids have RESP’s now and I will be getting a vehicle in the next few months. The past two years have had many ups and a few downs but it has been the most liberating two years of my life. Unfortunately I still have to deal with my ex’s bs and the affects it has on our children but I will NOT let him bully me back into silence. I will speak my truth and be proud of how far I’ve come. .

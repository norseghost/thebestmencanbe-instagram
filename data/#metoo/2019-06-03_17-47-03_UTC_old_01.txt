Airport selfie with this SHERO. ✈️🤳🏽 Nancy has been a wise, empowering voice in my life for over 20 years, but the last decade she’s been a personal, guiding voice to me. 💞 Breakfast together this morning talking all things faith, gender equality, justice, family, + @ezerandco was a great gift. 
You may know Nancy as one of the courageous women who broke the silence about the abuse at Willow Creek Community Church. Using her voice for equality, justice, + wholeness has cost her more than any of us will ever know. But moving forward always requires personal sacrifice. We are all better because of her tireless work. I’m so DEEPLY grateful for Nancy Beach.

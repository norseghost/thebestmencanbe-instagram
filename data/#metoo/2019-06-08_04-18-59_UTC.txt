I have spent so much of my life being consumed by the fires of guilt and shame. When my brother started sexually abusing me at the age of four, shame started consuming me.

It took years to speak about the abuse, and I am still unearthing new traumatic memories. But through it all, Christ has been here to comfort and guide me. I have not been consumed.

To my brother, my abuser: you did not win. I wonâ€™t be silent any longer. The shadow of shame is not mine, and it will not claim me.

                        "text": "Sometimes life will take you down a path you didn\u2019t plan to be on... This whole last 12 months has changed my entire life. With that being said let me be clear... I am NOT the woman I was last year. I thought that woman was tough... I had no idea how much more I could handle until I went through it. \nLet me reintroduce myself to you. Because chances are, you don\u2019t know this Melissa. - Single mother of 3\n- married and divorced twice\n- domestic violence survivor (not from previous marriage)\n- rape survivor (more than once)\n- narcissistic relationship survivor - Catholic - not good at it\n- \ud83c\udf08 <- most close to me understand, I\u2019m not put out \ud83e\udd23 \ud83d\udc8f\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc8b\u200d\ud83d\udc69\n- different take on dating and relationships after my last divorce\n- I don\u2019t judge people... if you want to judge me please unfollow\n- recovered shitty mom, drug free for 15 years \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f honestly don\u2019t remember exactly - recovered co-dependant - depression warrior\n- health nut with a balance \ud83c\udf4f\ud83c\udf69\ud83c\udf77\ud83e\udd55\n- dick pic hater\n- lazy girl at heart\n- singer of things\n- accident prone (I live with injuries daily)\n- I share my life because someone needs a reminder that they too can make it through the day... some days you are that person for me... some days in that person for you\n- I will NOT be silenced\n- current PTSD survivor and strive to not let it win me each day\n- I volunteer often\n- health coach but most of my focus lately is on a physical location to start group fitness for women\n- wine and coffee drinker... most days I drink them at their respected times, not always\n- friendly to just about everyone I meet - secretly a demon hunter \nDon\u2019t be afraid to evolve into the new you. It\u2019s scary af sometimes. For me, I don\u2019t need to be the old me. I\u2019ve learned so much this year. I don\u2019t particularly like all the new parts to me but I know I can overcome it and be stronger than I was before. \nHappy Friday. \n#metoo #domesticviolencesurvivor #ptsdrecovery #ifmywoundswerevisible #badmom #recoveredaddict #lifeafterdivorce #newhomeowner #mentalhealthwarrior #newpath"

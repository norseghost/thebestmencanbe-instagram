My American guests are affected by Mr. Trump’s visiting Japan. We had an earthquake during the tour, so I said “wow is he landing on Haneda Airport? He is shaking Tokyo!” Thank you Mr. Trump for shaking us and making me a good joker!😁 Again, my American guests are affected by Mr.Trump’s visit today. We could not enter a certain area of the Imperial Palace Outer Garden and had to wait until he passed. My guest does‘ t like him and repeatedly told me how bad he is. So I said”#meetoo” “so don’t worry you are not the only one!” She finally laughed! Happy guest, happy guide!😊#trump #guide #tokyo #japan#sightseeing #instajapan#instapic #privateguide#discoverjapan #explorejapan #instaphoto #tokyolife #travelwithme #metoo

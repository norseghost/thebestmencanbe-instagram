As many of you know, I am in the process of writing a book with practical advice as to how to protect your child from sexual predators. As part of my research I am conducting interviews because my experience is only one story. I want my book to be as complete as possible; so, I am interviewing other victims of child and adolescent sexual abuse. Iâ€™ve only spoken with women at this point, but some of my friends with sons have asked for specific advice regarding their boys. Therefore, I am looking to interview some men. As you can imagine, this is an intensively private subject for most. If you are or you know anyone that may be interested in sharing their experience and talking about practical advice to prevent abuse like theirs, please reach out to me privately.

Last week I met the lovely @bonnyturner1212 who told me about her horribly unjust experience of having her rape case dropped by the police despite getting a written confession! It's truly appalling and unacceptable. Rape is a crime and rapists should not go unpunished. Actions have consequences. Survivors certainly have to deal with the consequences and the aftermath of trauma, and letting a rapist off the hook is not ok. 
THIS is why so many of us never report our traumas... there is no accountability. And there should be.

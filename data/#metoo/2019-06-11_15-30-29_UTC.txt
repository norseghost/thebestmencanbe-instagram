*Friendly reminder!* My amazing friend Rae @raenmon is raising money for their top surgery, so all month long Iâ€™m donating 15% of Post-Traumatically Stressed Feminist sales to their fundraiser. So if youâ€™ve been meaning to get a copy, now is the time! ðŸ’š Link in bio. Must purchase through Etsy for this fundraiser or donate to their fundraiser directly via the link in their bio. @raenmon ðŸ’š

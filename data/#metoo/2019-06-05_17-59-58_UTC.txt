No should be enough and it is definitely not your fault. ❤️
“We were in my room, he was drunk I was not, he said yes I said no. He asked again I said no, he asked again and again and again. Apparently no is not enough and that I didn’t really mean no. I let him do it but I didn’t want to I repeatedly told him I didn’t want to. I am still unsure if I’m in the wrong or not and I’ve never been able to tell anyone just in case it was my fault for being in my room”

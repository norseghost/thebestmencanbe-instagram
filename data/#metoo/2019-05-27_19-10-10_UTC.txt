Pseudo-feminists have ruined the lives of Women across the world. They will only teach you to hate Men and generalize every male they come across (Brother, Father, Dog, Bull, Husband, Son etc.) .
.
.
#Feminists are a perfect example of "aurat hi aurat ki sabse badi dushman hai" Honestly, I believe the feminine energy is already powerful. .
.
.
Hence, Women don't need Empowerment, they just need Encouragement. .
.

Even the strongest lord or the ‘Devo ka Dev’ lies defeated under the feet of MahaKaali Maa. Thus our culture denotes if you`re a supreme invincible undisputed God, you can still be defeated by the Feminine energy. .

In Devlok, Lord Indra`s parliament had all the important ministries with women. Maa Saraswati was handling #Education and HRD ministry, Maa Durga was #Defence Minister, Mata Lakshmi was #Finance Minister, External affairs and International relations was with Menka and Apsara, Skanda mata had #Commerce Ministry, #FDA was with Annapurna, Law Enforcement and #Justice was with Kaali Maa.

Not just in India, even the Greeks had #Hera, #Aphrodite, #Athena etc. .
.
Also, speaking of the status of women in #Islam, when a girl is born she becomes the reason for her father to enter #Jannah, when she marries a man she completes half of his #religion and when she becomes a Mother, Jannat lies under her feet
.

I feel sorry for people who fell head on heels for some dumb chick who actually waited for 10 long years for the #MeToo movement on Social Media to rise from the west and float to India, only to realize that she needs to raise a voice for justice.

This is a land of the ferocious #Durga, Rani #Lakshmibai and #Neerja Bahnot. This country has given #sheroes like Kalpana Chawla, Rani Tarabai, Indira Gandhi, Dr Anandi Joshi, Amrita Shergill, Dr Kiran Bedi, Capt Lakshmi Sahgal, Rani #Padmavati, Rani Avantibai, #Savitribai Phule and the list goes on… .
.
.
To all the power sources of the Feminine energy, I hereby bow down to salute you for what you do to make this world a better place to live in. .

Highest Respect and Love,
Aditya Mhatre

On Friday, I had the honor of being the announcer for the 5th year in a row for the Inspiration Awards celebrating the honorees and the Class of 2019 of @StepUpWomensNetwork where we filled the @BeverlyWilshire with 700 guests and raised over $500,000! 🙌🏻
Before I took the mic that morning, I took some time to chat with the graduating girls, to chat with our generous sponsors, to walk the orange carpet and do some press interviews and fill out my answer on the “What makes you confident?” interactive board.
So, what makes me confident?
My dreams.
My brain trust/social circle.
My love.
This energizing city.
My talents.
My words & writing.
And, the @stepupwomensnetwork girls and amazing women I’ve met through this organization over the past 7 years.
This organization is magical - it creates a safe space for girls to develop, to dream and to carve out their destinies.✨
I am so honored to be just one small part of this well-oiled machine that changes women’s lives. If you’re able to do so today, I urge you to donate to Step Up. With this organization, you can not only see your dollars visibly at work, but you can see the efficacy of it every time a girl is accepted to college and begins her professional journey.
Nothing will fill your heart so full.🧡
Thank you to all of our sponsors - especially @sasshoemakers @benefitcosmetics @americanair @usbank @kendrascott @angelenomagazine @sprinklescupcakes and many more. And, thank you to all of the girls for working hard, dreaming big and supporting one another! You have lifelong friends now who will always be in your corner. And, you’ve got me, too.👯‍♀️

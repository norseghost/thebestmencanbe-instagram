                        "text": "I've written another piece for The Independent today\n\nA recent Vice investigation revealed that rape victims are being told not to discuss their experience with counsellors due to concerns that they'll be 'coached' ahead of their trial\n\nThis news wasn't particularly surprising to me because I experienced the same thing after reporting my rapist to the police last year. I was told that if I did see a counsellor, I'd only be able to talk to them about my feelings... rather than the specific details of what happened\n\nThe nonsense didn't end there because I was also warned that the police could request copies of my counselling notes and, if my case went to trial, these details could be read out in court\n\nHowever, as I explain in this piece, such restrictions won't stop victims 'rehearsing' their evidence, but they will stop them receiving the potentially life-saving support they deserve\n\nPlease click the link in my bio to read the piece in full. I'd also love it if you'd share the piece with your pals \u2665\ufe0f"

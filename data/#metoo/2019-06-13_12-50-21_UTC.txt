Saw this today and it spoke to me. 
Tomorrow I will be standing on the red circle at @tedx_glasgow and yes I will be nervous! 
But facing my fears by speaking out has been the best thing  Iâ€™ve ever done.
Sound check all done and tomorrow I will be sharing my story to 2000 people! 
Wish me luck!!ðŸ”´ ðŸŽ¤

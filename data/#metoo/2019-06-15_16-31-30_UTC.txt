I am so excited (and impressed) that my friend extremely talented friend @dianavarco is bringing her solo show, Shattered, to the @edinburghfringefestival in August - and she needs your support! .
This is a deeply personal show about dating, dysfunction and sexual devastation - and I truly believe it needs to be seen by as many people as possible. I had the pleasure of seeing the show in NYC a couple of years ago, and it was a truly powerful experience. 
At first I was hesitant to spend an evening engrossed in such a heavy topic, but she has used humor to make the subject more relatable, and I laughed just as much as I cried.

It is so important for us all to continue discussing the pain of sexual assault until it is eradicated for good. This play sheds a new light on the topic while also addressing so many other challenges that we all face in our lives. I left feeling a little bit less alone in the world and inspired to be more open and honest about my own sexual assault and personal struggles.

If you believe in women and the power of live theater, I hope you will join me in supporting her in the effort to bring this show to Edinburgh (and it's quite a lot of effort!) by supporting her kickstarter campaign (link in bio). AND, if youâ€™re in the LA area, do not miss the chance to see her perform the show at the @lyrichyperion TOMORROW June 16th! #metoo #metoomovement #tellyourstory #shareyourstories #soloshow #shatteredtheshow #edinburghfringefestival #fundraiser #kickstarter #theater #comedy #humor #supportthearts #womensupportingwomen #livetheater

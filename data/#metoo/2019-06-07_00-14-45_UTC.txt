***SWIPE👈🏻***
I have never understood the popularity of @TonyRobbins, a man who has always been so clearly a misogynistic, greedy, self-serving charlatan. This is a man who has trashed the #MeToo movement and all of the women who spoke out about being victims of sexual abuse, has bullied woman after woman, and has claimed that “emotional abuse” is just a term that women use to describe things that men have said to them that they didn’t like (see last two slides). If you’re a fan of this guy, you’re being played. You need to wake up and stop putting money in his pocket. There are high-quality, compassionate, educated, intelligent, benevolent motivational speakers out there, and Tony Robbins ISN’T ONE OF THEM! 🙅🏼‍♀️

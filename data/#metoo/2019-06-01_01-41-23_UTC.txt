Through this process, she realized she wanted to do more to celebrate and recognize South Asian people in all walks of life. Working in corporate full-time, she founded her @DesiVibesMedia where she celebrates her culture through music and arts and hopes to inspire youth to embrace their identity and truly be themselves.

The concept of unity and family did not exist for Krishna until recently. Being the independent girl she is, she always found ways to “figure it out.” As an introvert, she found a home in her thoughts and the books and movies she indulged in. As a survivor of sexual assault, she found her voice and the courage to speak against the injustices she and many women like her face in society  through #BrownGirlMag’s #MeToo panel. And the sisterhood and love received from the amazing browngirls (shout out to @TrishaSakhuja_Walia) helped her realize the importance of community and unity.💞💭

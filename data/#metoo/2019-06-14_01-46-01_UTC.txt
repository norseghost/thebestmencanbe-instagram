This happened a while ago , but I was ALREADY having a really hard week. Just to be violated on my way to class! Dude was on the bus trying to touch women , because the bus was packed and itâ€™d probably come off as an accident . Some men are just absolute creeps . At the time I was really not up for arguing (it was the day before my birthday and I was feeling really low). I gave him a disgusted look and when it happened I was getting off of the bus , so I just didnâ€™t make a big deal out of it. When I got in the building I went to the bathroom and cried . Not sure why , but it really really made me feel terrible. I wished I had stood up and yelled at him , but I was just already in a really bad place . Women have to deal with these types of random harassment all the time. Itâ€™s not okay and in the moment you just wanna get away from the person and situation. At the time I wasnâ€™t really sure how to handle the situation. Now I know what to do If (hopefully not) something like that weâ€™re to happen again. Just encouraging any woman whoâ€™s ever been in this position to speak up and embarrass  the creep! (@myprettyweeds) ðŸŒ±

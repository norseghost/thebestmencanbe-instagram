CreditCreditIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times\nThese Rape Victims Had to Sue to Get the Police to Investigate\nAs more women come forward to report sexual assault, some say law enforcement has failed them. \u2018There was no collection of evidence,\u2019 one victim said. \u2018Except off my body.\u2019Evidence so neglected it grew mold. Calls to the authorities for help that went unanswered. Witnesses and victims who were never interviewed. These are just a handful of the claims that sexual assault survivors are making against law enforcement in courts around the country.\n\nIn at least seven places in recent years \u2014 Austin; San Francisco; Memphis; Houston; Baltimore; Greenwich, Conn.; and the Village of Robbins, Ill. \u2014 women have filed lawsuits in an attempt to force the police and prosecutors to improve their practices.\n\nThe unconnected lawsuits are adding a set of novel legal arguments to the search for solutions in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which exposed failures to recognize and pursue sex offenders. The lawsuits argue that sexual assault victims do not receive equal treatment compared with victims of other violent crimes, and that failure to test physical evidence collected from their bodies amounts to unreasonable search and seizure.\n\nWomen have long feared skepticism when they reported being attacked by someone they know, and advocates have gone to great lengths to educate the public and law enforcement about the prevalence of what has been called date rape or acquaintance rape. But in these lawsuits, a striking number of plaintiffs say they faced disbelief or indifference when they reported being attacked \u2014 kidnapped, choked, drugged, and even submerged in water \u2014 by complete strangers"

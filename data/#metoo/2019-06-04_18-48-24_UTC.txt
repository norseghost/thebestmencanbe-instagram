Iâ€™ve just finished my painting of Circe inspired by Madeline Millerâ€™s wonderful book. I love this character from Greek mythology. Spoiler alert ðŸš¨ - She was an exiled goddess who after being attacked by visitors to her island used her knowledge of plants ðŸŒ± and sorcery to turns subsequent men into pigs. This painting is all about reclaiming power, the original #metoo girl. Itâ€™s a new direction for me, I really wanted to wrench myself out of realism, use my imagination and have more fun. Swipe for my original sketch I did after reading the book on holiday. Hope you like - feedback welcome.
Did you spot the pigs and boat?

'The truth of it is, the shame was not mine, and for all victims in similar situations, it is not ours. The shame is reserved for every creep who has ever touched us inappropriately. The shame is on the abuser, not the victim, not the survivor.'- Rose McGowan.

#accessibility [Photo description:
A bright blue lake, with blue mountains with snowy peaks in the background. In the foreground centered is a white kayak, facing straight ahead facing the mountains. In the kayak is a strong athletic young blonde woman. She's wearing a backwards red baseball cap, and a black sports vest. She's holding the paddle in front of her, raised slightly on the left.
There's text in the photo that reads 'can't break us'.] #overcomeabuse #rapesurvivor #childabusesurvivor #timesup #metoo #empowersurvivors

**trigger warning—sexual abuse and pregnancy termination**
.
some of my closest friends were not aware of my abortion care. i spend so much time sounding the alarm about childhood sexual abuse because the response is always an overwhelming “me too.” and i know that those horrific stories will only continue to come to light. 😢
.
but on my first full day as a returning GA resident, women’s bodies are under literal attack through policy and culture. as if it weren’t enough being Black and woman in a world crafted for white men. 😳
.
my living is resistance. my joy subverts the paradigm. my “very presence is subterfuge.” @kanisha358 😩
.
but surviving is not enough for me. despite everything i’ve endured, i am flourishing. with God’s love 💜, my ancestors’ guidance 💫, deep community 👏🏿, psychotherapy 🗣, spin 🚴🏾‍♀️, yoga 🧘🏾‍♀️, nourishing food 🥗, delicious tea 🍵 (👋🏿 @teaswithmeaning), prayer 🙏🏿, and meditation 📿, i have curated a life of #Surthrival. 🙌🏿
.
and my Surthrival *requires* time and intentionality. there are days when i’m triggered. where all i can do is to weep and wonder. when i feel like my tear ducts should be all dried out, but they still flow. 💧
.
and there are times of immense gratitude. when i savor all that the Divine has gifted me with and i realize that my story didn’t have to end up like this. 💛
.
but it did. and it is. so just know that if i’m quiet, it’s because i’m healing. i would never want to speak or do from a place of pain. not when my words have power and my intentions have substance. 💪🏿✊🏿
.
so be encouraged. take heart. and don’t ever let the pressure to post override your birthright to heal (@yoloakili). 🌻🌱✨

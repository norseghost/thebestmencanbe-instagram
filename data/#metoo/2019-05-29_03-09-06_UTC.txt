Today we stood beside Tara's teachers in support of this nationwide strike, as thousands of teachers took to the street, without pay to be the voice of our children, our future generations. Many people have spent the past few days complaining that they have had to find sitters, or have a day off work to care for their children. Teachers are NOT babysitters, they are there to walk alongside your children, teaching them, encouraging them, shaping their minds so that when comes a time, and they are leading our country, they will have the skills, knowledge, and education to succeed in this world. Teachers are not only striking for better pay, they are fighting for our tamariki so that the ones that need extra support and needs are having them met with resources and teacher aids, for better work conditions, I have yet to meet a teacher that doesn't take work home, or spends weekends and holidays lesson planning for the rage of different levels of learning for each child. There are less and less teachers coming into the profession so this is putting more and more pressure on one's already working their butt's off. I see firsthand everytime I go into Tara's school, the amount of hard work that is put into, supporting the children, the stress they face. The teachers and support staff at Tara's school do an absolute incredible job with what they have, which isnt much, but they work so hard to be an inclusive school, and not chucking kids in the too hard basket. Also a huge thank you to Erika Harvey and her beautiful daughter Piper that got up and spoke on behalf of all of us parents that have autism and high needs, your work is also very much appreciated.
Kia kaha ngā kaiako ma, ngā mihi nui ki a koutou.

Keep your fingers crossed for me! Its been my goal to have signings in local books stores. Here in my home town of Tucson, but also in local book shops in other big reading cities like Portland, San Francisco, New York, Boston, and so on... And I may just get to have a signing at Powell's soon! I'd be honored!!! Also, its my goal to speak out publicly about being a victim of sexual violence and abuse, and how I survived seven years of abuse and being trafficked. Please, it you have a platform in which my voice may help. Contact me.

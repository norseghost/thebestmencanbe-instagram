Because trauma is of the body, it must be healed through the body. And only one place could offer me that. 
One June evening when I was 30, I walked into @velocity_seattle off 12th Avenue and entered the hush of an empty studio. Before dance class, I lay back on the hardwood and gazed up at the skylights, the fading blue of evening. My body in a room full of other bodies, other pain, other joy. 
The floor, for a dancer, is a partner. You are always in collaboration with it. You caress it with a tendu, you tumble into its embrace in Martha Graham’s style, you launch into space from it. If you have danced for many years, you learn to feel it pushing against the soles of your feet. “Floor” in English has always seemed such a cold word to me. So distancing. The French “sol” is closer. From Latin for soil, the ground. The sun. There is warmth in that. And life. The floor held me, and I felt it holding me. Gravity pulled me down, and the floor cradled me. Hugging my shoulder blades, absorbing the weight of my pelvis, cupping my heels. 
It was the first touch in a long time that was so intimate and so welcome. I had forgotten what it was to feel safe in my own body. 
That night, I began to remember.

Starting my Tuesday off with a positive quote and affirmation. I have another big kid interview this week and the weather is beautiful in Ohio. Recovery has its ups and downs but Iâ€™m glad to be in it. I have therapy today which Iâ€™m no longer ashamed to say. 
Youâ€™re all doing amazing and youâ€™re all so brave.

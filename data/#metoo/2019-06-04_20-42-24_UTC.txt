When life gets crazy ( which it always will) itâ€™s so easy ( and somehow automatic) for me to take care of everyone else and not only put myself last but actually forget about me. 
In the past I used to get up early, make sure breakfast was made for everyone, get everyone out the door and rush around like a crazy woman trying to keep up and get myself where I needed to be. Although I had cooked breakfast, i wouldnâ€™t make myself anything and would def not sit down to eat ( because there â€œwasnâ€™t any time â€œ)- I would sometimes just rush out the door and grab a bar and shove it down the hatch or totally skip breakfast altogether. 
Making myself sit down and eat with my family, everyday, especially the days that are extra full has helped me include myself ( I did it for everyone else anyway) and seriously , increase my self worth. #metoo 
It might seem small, but itâ€™s from focusing on the small stuff that big things tend to happen. 
Love yourself enough to include yourself in all the care and love you give to others. Many of us ( women and moms) are taught and brought up to be martyrs... and not only that, validate ourselves from doing so! 
Eating breakfast was just a start for me, now I apply this simple principle to every area of my life. #selflove 
My hope of to raise two incredible, unique , brave and brain daughters that know their worth, their gifts and that they are worthy of extraordinary. In order to do so I must transform and own this truth ðŸ’•âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨ #growtogether #familygoals #family #selfcare #bethelight #bethechange

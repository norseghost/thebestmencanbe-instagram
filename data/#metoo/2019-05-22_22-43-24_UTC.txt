We went back to the lab and created a different cover for my Best Self journals that help people focus to improve the quality of their thoughts and actions. Each color represents a cause that has affected me or someone I know. Here are the color definitions. Pink: Breast Cancer Awareness. Green: Mental Health Awareness. Purple: Domestic violence, suicide prevention and the me too movement. Blue: Bullying awareness What colors resonate with you? #bully #cancer #metoo #domesticviolence #breastcancer #suicide #mentalhealthawareness #bestself #support #leadership #emergingleaders #leader #goals #selfawareness

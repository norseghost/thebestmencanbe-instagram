To every woman who is following through with her light, regardless of how tough things  get.
.
.
To every woman living her purpose and doing right by God and Humanity.
.
.

To every woman who goes to bed every night in tears but still wake up and boss up.
.
.
To every woman life has tossed in different directions but still staying true to her dreams .
.
To every woman who refuse to let anyone dim her light and reduce her grace.
.
.
.
To every woman who has been stripped down to nothing but still showing love to the world.
.
.

To that sister who will see this and know her purpose is bigger than her. .
.
.
Keep the fire burning. Your light is your staying power. Don't stay down, don't quit, don't give up. .  I love you Queen 💛❤👑

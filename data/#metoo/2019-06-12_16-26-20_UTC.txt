In the 1960s, social movements began to grow more and more, and awareness for sexual violence was no exception. “The Feminine Mystique” was published by Betty Friedan in 1963, and this sparked a “second wave of feminism,” the Women’s Suffrage Movement ending in 1920 being the first (Donat). This book helped to generalize the fight against sexual violence with the public. In addition to this, The National Organization for Women was started in 1966, this helped women to find their voice even more. The sixties helped to progress American Rape Laws, and in contrast to the previous decades, rape began to be viewed as more of a weapon, but women were still struggling to get help (Bishop). #metoo #metoomovement #1960s #rapeculture

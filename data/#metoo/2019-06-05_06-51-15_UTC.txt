At a @kimyadawson concert earlier this spring some douche thought it was a good idea to touch my boob when I was sticking up for my friend who he had singled out to be an ass to. I screamed at him while the music was playing and called him out on his bullshit. Being the wussy that he was he ran away. The community of other women around who had seen what had gone down also came forward and told us that he’d been touching them too. It is amazing, the community that these experiences can create between individuals who would otherwise pass each other by. Remember it’s okay to stick up for yourself if you feel uncomfortable. It’s okay to call people out if what they are doing is crossing a line. You never know who else might be experiencing it too and it might just give them the power to speak up for themselves like you. #girlpower

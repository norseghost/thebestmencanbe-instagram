For the entire 17 years Iâ€™ve been involved in Haiti â€” I have watched the ways North Americans can come to cheat, abuse, steal, and hurt Haiti â€” other North Americans see it too â€”- Iâ€™ve been branded by a few as the pot stirring jerk that wonâ€™t be quiet and Christian.  Hereâ€™s the deal â€” silence in the face of evil is not Christian.  Itâ€™s weak and itâ€™s bullshit.  When organizations take children from poor Haitian families under false pretensesâ€” SPEAK UP - when organizations raise money to help starving kids but then spend the money on their guest house and their generator and their nice vehicles - SPEAK UP â€” when organizations have a dude employed thatâ€™s fond of having affairs with multiple Haitian women OR is fond of hanging out with little boys â€”- SPEAK UP !!! ğŸ—£ğŸ—£ğŸ—£ğŸ—£ğŸ—£ğŸ—£ğŸ—£ğŸ—£
Staying quiet and shrugging and pretending you donâ€™t know makes you an accomplice and it makes you wrong. ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ Haiti had enough of its own corruptionâ€”- we need the shitty Americans called out and removed and held accountable and we need to speak up.  #missionstoo #churchtoo #metoo

Final Countdown! In 4 days, The Monument Quilt will blanket the National Mall in Washington, DC in the country’s largest tribute dedicated to survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence. The Monument Quilt is a public art project made by and for survivors and part of the Baltimore-based @upsettingrapeculture, a national art and activist collective. Asana Consulting is a very proud sponsor of this historic event that will bring over 3000 survivors’ stories and demands to the national stage to be heard and honored. Follow our countdown this week for more on The Monument Quilt and why Asana Consulting loves and supports it. #notalone #MonumentQuilt #MeToo #thepowerofstorytelling #YoTeCreoSIEMPRE #NoEstásSolx

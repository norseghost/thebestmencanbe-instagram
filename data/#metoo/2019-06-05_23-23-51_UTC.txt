Chloe and Nicky Taylor are sisters with completely opposite personalities. Nicky was always the wild child, while Chloe was quiet and studious. As adults, Chloe is the head of a feminist magazine called Eve and the founder of a major movement that piggybacked off #metoo , called #themtoo , aimed at giving voices to women who may not have found a way to speak up on their own. Nicky straightened herself out during college and married a young prosecutor named Adam McIntosh and had a son named Ethan. Shortly after becoming a mother, Nicky begins to unravel and eventually makes one major misstep that causes Adam to leave her and take Ethan with him. Fast forward 15 years and Chloe is now married to Adam, and together they raised Ethan. Seems like one happy family....until Chloe finds Adam dead in their apartment and Ethan is put on trial for his murder.....

Meh, not a fan of this one. It’s long and drawn out with a predictable plot and ending. Don’t waste your time. Two stars, maybe two and half at most.

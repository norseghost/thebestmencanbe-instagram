“I was drunk and he took me home and said that nothing would happen which I was fine with I just needed a place to sleep. When there he started trying to have sex with me. He didn’t ask if I wanted to and at one point he tried to put his dick in me and I said no but he kept trying. Pushed him off and left.” #ournakedtruth #speakout #metoo #universitysexualassault #prochoice #sexualassault #brave #fightback #speakup #nomeansno #standtogether #anonymousconfessions #sexualassaultconfession #confession

My mother's daughter, never far from sin. Saintly, gentle martyr, judgment bleeds from skin. He closes his eyes. Oh sister! Eyes of the Lord! I know not what I do! I am without tongue and blind! Hear me, I'm begging you! Born of sin this lusted child, a whore before she's bled! Her screams unheard - unclean! unclean! unclean! Just stone her dead! Where is my voice? Who will care for me? Where is my Lord, does he choose not to see? AND WHERE IS THE JUSTICE FOR LITTLE GIRLS LIKE ME?

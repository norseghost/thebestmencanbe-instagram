                        "text": "Sad but true. \n#Repost @_weareher\n\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\nWe have a new post on the blog by one of our featured contributors [namasteallday]. She wrote a letter to her mom and in it, she wrote about how she never blamed her mother for anything that happened to her family since her mom was a victim of her father\u2019s abuse too.\n\nI thought that was really powerful. But I\u2019m also saddened knowing that so many abusers have multiple victims in their lifetime.\n\nI\u2019m sure some have too many to count. I know my abusive ex has numerous women across the country who have stories of his abuse.\n\nHow many of us have to band together before these abusers see justice? I know so many of us have poured our hearts and our truths out in court rooms, police stations, and hospitals just to see nothing come of it.\n\nI know even more of us have stayed silent because we\u2019ve seen firsthand how survivors can be treated. We know that even if multiple victims come forward, there will still be those who echo chants about how we are looking for attention or how we must be lying since we kept our secret for so long.\n\nI don\u2019t know an answer on how we fix abusers. Some argue that once they\u2019re a certain age, it\u2019s too late for them to recognize the errors of their ways. But I want you to know, that there are people out there fighting for us\u2014making sure that there aren\u2019t more victims, making sure that your story is heard.\nSending love and strength to all of you today. Some days are hard, and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just a part of our healing journey. #WeAreHER\n\n#survivor #abuse #domesticviolence #sexualassault #rape #heal #empower #restore #survivorsisters #sisterhood #abuser #healing #nomore #metoo #solidarity #feminism #qotd #quote #assault #court"

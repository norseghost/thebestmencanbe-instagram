The moment that a person goes from Victim to Survivor has nothing to do with deciding they don’t need to hold their abusers accountable for the crimes against them.
.
That moment of empowerment arises when the Survivor is so clear about the abuse they suffered and the role that they played in their suffering that they no longer need anybody to validate their experience, or understand.

It has been said that: “Of all the parts of your body, be most vigilant over your index finger, for it is blame-thirsty. A pointed finger is a victim’s logo.” — Joseph Brodsky

But I will proudly say that after more than 24 hours of excruciating labor, after a tumultuous gestation, I came into this world with both fingers pointed at the doctor, and then I shat on that man.
.
I didn’t cry when I was born, and people have questioned my reasons any time I’ve cried sense.
.
When you point your finger at a person, you are putting your energy into them. You are flooding them with your perspective. And then they’ll have to reckon with it.
.
Point your fucking fingers. Stomp your feet on the ground. Let them eat the poisons that they created in your body, themselves. That may be the best way for those poisons to make their way out.
.
And remember, we don’t know what Jesus actually said. All we have is some 4th or 5th hand words about what he supposedly said — words written by men, with agendas. And translated by men. With agendas.
.
“Forgiveness,” Jesus told me, “is overrated. If you turn the other cheek, you are bringing suffering upon yourself.”
.
Most of what you have been told were lies.
.
Pay attention.

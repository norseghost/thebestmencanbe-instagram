When she came to me, she dumped an emotional load in front of me of the massive sexual abuse she had sustained since childhood.  She couldn\u2019t walk due to her pelvic pain.  The amount of trauma she had suffered in her pelvic region was great.  Doctors blew her off and operated on her abdomen and pelvis to \u201cunderstand the pain.\u201d But no one actually listened to her.\nNo one heard her story because it was filled with so much rage.\nShe was overwhelming.\nBut through our treatments together, a \ud83d\udca1 lightbulb went off and she started seeing the impact she could have to empower women and men with her story.  But she had to deal with the emotions. \nI worked with her physically, but so much of our treatment has been touching her heart and spirit and she is coming to a place of love and peace.  She is walking and laughing.  She is considering sexual activity with her amazingly patient husband.\u2764\ufe0f She is starting to receive and give love.\n\u2049\ufe0fShe wants me to interview her about her journey, her pain and healing.\n\u2049\ufe0fHow many women are walking around with chronic pelvic pain who have endured sexual trauma #metoo ?!\n\u2049\ufe0fHow many women could be impacted by someone loving on them, listening to them, touching their mind, body and spirit? \u2705As a result, I am feeling called to create an online program to address pelvic pain through abuse and trau, empowering women to heal from their past, feel good about their body, live without pain\nWho has dealt with physical pain as a result of abuse and trauma?  Can I touch lives that are hiding in fear?  We\u2019ve said that we are willing to speak out against sexual abuse, but now what?  Are we willing to help these women heal from it? \nWho\u2019s with me? \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Speaking out is essential.  Now, empowering and healing of the mind, body and spirit is crucial\n#medicinewomanrising \n#curvyhustle \n#togetherwerise \n#beawarriorofyourhealth \n#metoomovement\n#pursuitwithpurpose \n#madeformore \n#mindbodyspirit \n#mindsetmatters \n#metoochallenge\n#physicaltherapist \n#appliedfunctionalscience"

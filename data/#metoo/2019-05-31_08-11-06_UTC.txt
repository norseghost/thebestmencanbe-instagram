Looking back at a trauma isn't easy therefor was I going to leave it all behind but the obsessive one suffers his bitter sweet life with his zombie slaves running around doing his dark missions. Dedicating his life to ruin mine, plus others innocents. The reason: I didn't want to be with him. I had to run away in fear but I decided to fight with love and light, as a guru, perhaps he can learn that to!

My mistakes: trusting to easy = reflector on your inner being, projecting upon others
then being tempted and not being in touch with my intuition.

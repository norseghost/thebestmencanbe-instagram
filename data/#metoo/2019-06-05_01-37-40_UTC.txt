Consensual forced sex fantasies are the second most common fantasy people reported having in the largest survey of sexual fantasies in America. I learned this and so much more from my chat with researcher @justinjlehmiller. We discussed the conflicting feelings around forced sex fantasies in the #MeToo era and being considered “rape fantasies”. HIGHLY recommend listening to this episode to unpack this. We also answered a ton of your questions around sexual fantasies and how to have better sex, the link is in my bio, ENJOY FRIENDS! 💛 #letstalkaboutit #sexualhealth •

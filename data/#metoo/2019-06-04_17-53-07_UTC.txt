Inspired by a conversation in a private Facebook group, writer Amanda Deibert (@amandadeibertofficial) asked women on Twitter: "What do you use when you go out running?" ⁣

The viral thread ignited a conversation about the extent women go to protect themselves while running or jogging. Some pack a pocket knife, others invest in self-defense gadgets, including panic buttons or knife rings. Deibert said she is surprised by how many men are unaware of the threats facing women on the road.⁣

I love my little fighter. 
She’s only a few years old and she’s already understanding what consent is, what safe areas are and what to do if someone touches her in an unsafe area.

She knows she has a voice and a right to say no, even if it’s a family member wanting to give her a hug she has the choice to say “no thank you!” In a consumer culture where you can view porn at the touch of a finger I want my daughter to grow up knowing she has a voice and that there’s a major difference between love and lust. 
That she doesn’t have to say yes because her boyfriend is pressuring her. That if someone sexually abuses her she has the right to stand up and tell someone, that she deserves to be protected. -

This girl has a huge understanding of empathy and what love is, she knows what it looks like to be mistreated and even unheard by the system. She is brave, courageous and knows she has a voice. I pray that she continues to use it even when people don’t listen. That she doesn’t give up on fighting for love and standing up against people who use and abuse. -

Teach your kids what consent is, even if they’re little they’ll understand.  There is a fantastic book by @justinholcomb and his wife that talks about how God made all of us, what consent is and what to do if someone sexually abuses you. It has made a huge difference in her life and her understanding of love and abuse. The book is geared towards children.

P.S. @fightthenewdrug, maybe y’all should launch a kids line one day for little fighters. 🤟🏻💕

Pretty sure this is gun owners everywhere!! ðŸ˜‚ 
Reposted from @thecanadiangunvault -  This great post from our friends over at @assurancearms comes to us via @gungoddessdotcom and i think accurately describes what many gun owners in Canada "wish" for. The simple truth is "hoping" is not enough. Everyone needs to do their part to ensure that this Liberal Government does not survive through the 2019 election season, without feeling the cold repercussions of their actions. We want them to hear loud and clear what this will cost everyone who voted in favour of C71. - #regrann

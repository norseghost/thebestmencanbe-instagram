THIS. There are so many sides of depression and it so important that as a bystander, you have to understand and listen. Depression isn't always about feeling "suicidal, not getting out of bed, not talking to anyone, being sad all the time". Most people fight that battle alone, and inside of them, all the time. Please don't make such assumptions.

UNAPOLOGETICALLY AMBITIOUS ü¶ã spent the afternoon in Chicago yesterday, filming something new about POWER and what it truly means to feel EMPOWERED. The conversation captured yesterday filled me with the energy I need for A BIG DAY TOMORROW.
.
TOMORROW IS WORLD MENSTRUAL HYGIENE DAY üö® and I‚Äôm so excited to be releasing some new content that is really personal and special. Something I‚Äôve been dreaming of sharing for years‚Ä¶ #staytuned
.
To date @periodmovement has addressed over 560k periods for menstruators in need, and registered over 350 campus chapters, and this is just the beginning! #joinus
.
In honor of the 28-day menstrual cycle, help us raise $28,000 to supply menstruators with the necessary period products to feel confident and clean every menstrual cycle, no matter their income. Text ‚ÄúGIVEPERIOD‚Äù to 44321 to donate this #MenstrualHygieneDay

People are afraid to associate with me . So much of the world bows to the Saudi regime.. but I am very angry at them..because of the Shi’a genocide.. I know it’s an uncomfortable thing to talk about in America we are spoiled and ungrateful for our freedoms.. and look, I don’t even like Islam anymore because I saw far to much suffering when I did and I actually loved those people... so many in America would rather pretend the universe is a magic lamp they can rub so their dreams come true .. it’s not..

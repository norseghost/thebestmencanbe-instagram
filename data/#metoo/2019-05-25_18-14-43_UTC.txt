Obviously as a grown adult it is up to you to decide what you want to do.  But choosing NOT to forgive the abuser does not mean you don’t move forward.  On the contrary.  Anything that has to be forced is not authentic anyway.  If you absolutely hate the abuser and hope she/he burns in hell, honestly, that’s probably a perfectly healthy response. 
I can say from experience that this feeling of hatred naturally cools down to a feeling of vague pity toward the abuser, or perhaps mild contempt
Am I going to waste a second of my time or an ounce of my energy trying to “forgive” the nasty little narc who described my child — and his own flesh and blood — as “Unnatural” and “nothing to be proud of"?
Oh. hell. no. .

But what I did do is accept, and move on.
I don’t mean that I accepted this creature’s abuse or that I'd even acknowledge his existence if I was unfortunate enough to ever run into him again.
I mean that I accepted the reality that the abuser is a sick person and that this is what it is. 
The abuser is beyond help and never had anything to offer me or anyone else. (Well, to be fair, he is a former crack dealer so I guess he had something to offer crack addicts). So I moved on and most  importantly, I forgave myself for having been naive and self-sabotaging enough to ever let such an individual anywhere near me.  And for burdening my precious daughter with such a disgraceful biological father.  That was a whole lot of forgiveness.

Did you forgive yourself?

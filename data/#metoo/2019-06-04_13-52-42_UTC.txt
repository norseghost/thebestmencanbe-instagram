Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, was elected  the first time in 2007 and noted memorably: “This is a historic moment – for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working."

Woman is Goddess. Our unity is going to dedicate a lot of attention to the issue of “Woman is a holy! Divine! Goddess Mentality ” ! The Church and all world has allowed to put a woman down ! Not one feet of any woman should be in churches that call God a man or “he” if she respects herself or wants any change regarding how she is treated ! This is a huge issue that requires actions! No issue in the world resonates or hurts me as much as “hurting and obused woman” Religion, mentality of man obusing woman is rediculously ungodly !who is God in Catholic Church? Man and his penis and that’s what everyone there to praise instead of st least equally praising those from whom it actually depended will they get life or they will not ! I refuse from this mentality and they praise themselves and put down those who gave them life ! They intended to take care of woman, now they manipulate and obuse them they call them “gold diggers, prostitutes, sexually harass them, disrespect them” maybe woman should start doing abortion if she conceived a boy in this case and we can see who will turn out to be the God that will be left and to whom belongs the decision to save the life of a man! To take or give life ! Of course I am not being serious regarding an abortion but woman is at least equal to a man and God isn’t a man! And God isn’t a Son, a God is Love and life whatever it is a woman, a man or a tree! Who is giving life to man? God! The her Highness Holy! Woman! How did we woman let this happen? Ow no I am not going to let it continue! Man are our children ! They need to act as silk! Who raised them who conceived them ! The view and treatment of woman is going to get changed in my lifetime !  watch and see!!! Meanwhile, woman, find power within yourself and make sure you are appreciated in your home, make sure when they have breakfast, they thank God, you, for a new day and that you gave them life to have it- you! God!

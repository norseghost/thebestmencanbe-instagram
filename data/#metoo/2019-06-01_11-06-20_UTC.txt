I was delayed in my reporting by nearly three years. It was a decision that initially I didn’t know was one I could or should make.  It wasn’t until years later that someone even posed it as an option. This got me thinking – and I started doing my own research about reporting.  I now know that part of why I reported was to take some control back that was taken from me by my rapist. Why did you report?

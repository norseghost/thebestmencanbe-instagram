Boston's subways now ban ads for co-working spaces to support working women, because the ads say "The World was built for men. The Wing is built for you.” Meanwhile, they allow erectile dysfunction ads with catch phrases like "You’re on this train for the next 15 minutes. Make the most of it.” From Fortune: "Increasing awareness of perceived sexist double standards in advertising has led to outraged coverage ad and outspoken protest of a range of banned subway ads (mostly in New York City’s MTA system) in recent years, and has often pushed the transit administrations to agree to run the campaigns. But The Wing’s experience in Boston exposes a less clear-cut situation. In the #MeToo era, with women fighting for equality in more outspoken ways than ever before, with increasing (though still shockingly small) numbers of female-founded companies gaining both attention and funding, it still comes down to city bureaucracy to determine whether mansplaining—and, perhaps, the patriarchy—is real." http://fortune.com/2019/06/14/the-wing-boston-advertising/

”Happy Monday! We hope the rain doesn’t have you all too deep into the Monday blues. We just wanted to take the time to say THANK YOU, to all who supported, inquired about, and took the time to share your stories for our first Damn, You Too? series. We literally couldn’t have done it without your help and we are incredibly humbled. It was our absolute pleasure to share your stories, as well as our hope that in some way, this experience was healing for you all. As women, when one loses, we all lose. We are 100% stronger together, than apart. Stay Tuned for more from us here, at DreamofBee .... we’re just getting started. 😉♥️🐝”

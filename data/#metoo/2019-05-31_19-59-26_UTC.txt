Stuck in a state of Gratitude 
Can’t say that’s a bad place to be stuck in 😜

I grew up wondering why people were so negative... why others made fun of other people. 
Why people had to talk about others. 
I felt like I didn’t fit in often, even amongst church people. 
I wanted positivity. 
I wanted people to look at the glass half full... scratch that OVER FLOWING! 
I wanted to love everyone and help everyone. 
I wanted MORE out of this life. 
I wanted to push the envelope and believe in my big scary dreams! 
But I found I was often alone.... And honestly, I WAS often.

Today as an adult, I get to be amongst the most inspiring, uplifted, dreamers, thought leaders, innovators and health driven individuals on the planet. 
It may have taken 31 years... but I FOUND MY PEOPLE! ♥️ I am so grateful right here, right now... and I refuse to ever get “unstuck” from it !

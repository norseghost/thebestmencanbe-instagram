Sometimes life will take you down a path you didn’t plan to be on... This whole last 12 months has changed my entire life. With that being said let me be clear... I am NOT the woman I was last year. I thought that woman was tough... I had no idea how much more I could handle until I went through it. 
Let me reintroduce myself to you. Because chances are, you don’t know this Melissa. - Single mother of 3
- married and divorced twice
- domestic violence survivor (not from previous marriage)
- rape survivor (more than once)
- narcissistic relationship survivor - Catholic - not good at it
- 🌈 <- most close to me understand, I’m not put out 🤣 💏👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩
- different take on dating and relationships after my last divorce
- I don’t judge people... if you want to judge me please unfollow
- recovered shitty mom, drug free for 15 years 🤷‍♀️ honestly don’t remember exactly - recovered co-dependant - depression warrior
- health nut with a balance 🍏🍩🍷🥕
- dick pic hater
- lazy girl at heart
- singer of things
- accident prone (I live with injuries daily)
- I share my life because someone needs a reminder that they too can make it through the day... some days you are that person for me... some days in that person for you
- I will NOT be silenced
- current PTSD survivor and strive to not let it win me each day
- I volunteer often
- health coach but most of my focus lately is on a physical location to start group fitness for women
- wine and coffee drinker... most days I drink them at their respected times, not always
- friendly to just about everyone I meet - secretly a demon hunter 
Don’t be afraid to evolve into the new you. It’s scary af sometimes. For me, I don’t need to be the old me. I’ve learned so much this year. I don’t particularly like all the new parts to me but I know I can overcome it and be stronger than I was before. 
Happy Friday.

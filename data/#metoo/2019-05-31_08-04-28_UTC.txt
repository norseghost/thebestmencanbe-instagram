My 6 year old friend said that this is the way to pose for a picture! Lol!!! I have to say... not to bad! Haha! I love little kiddos, their hearts are so pure and they are so sure of what they are saying that you have to believe in it as well❤️ 26th night of Ramadan almost gone and I am so sad that it is ending! I will miss it so much! I love my faith! #muslimaforlife #islamismyway #proudtobemuslimah #learningtolovemyself #takingbackmylife  #divorcedmom #iamworthit #warrior #downshiftology #motiv8performance #gymadict #nevergivingup #nevergoingback  #hardworkpaysoffs #goaldigger #ultimatefitness #eachonereachone #dontstopgetitgetit #everyonehasastory #youarewhatmakesithappen #teamalphamale #slimlifesolutions #sleevelife #girlwashyourface #girlstopapologizing #metoo #liveinthemoment #madeformore

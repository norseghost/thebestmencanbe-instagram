I’ve been thinking alot lately. It’s a good thing. I’ve put my heart and soul into my book and it’s just not ready for the launch so now what? There is a part of me that just wants to give up. A big part. And then there is a small part that says keep pushing forward. Keep going because it helps. It helps people who have experienced sexual abuse. It helps people who have not experienced sexual abuse. It helps both sides start a conversation. Maybe just maybe it gives a picture of what it like but maybe it’s not enough. Maybe I should just let it rest knowing I put it all out on paper. Maybe that’s good enough. #goodenough #isit #sexualabusesurvivor #newbook #enough #metoo #melodiethurman #shouldi #maybe #maybenot #silence #heartandsoul

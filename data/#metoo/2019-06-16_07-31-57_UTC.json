                        "text": "#sexkitten \"#gloriasteinem first came across the radar of Black men in #1978 when Steinem put a book called \u201c#BlackMacho and the #Myth of the #Superwoman\u201d on the cover of #MsMagazine, the magazine which she controlled. The book was \u201cwritten\u201d by a #Blackfeminist\n and \u201cactivist\u201d named #MiceleWallace who came out of nowhere. Wallace was in her early twenties at the time, yet she was being touted as the \u201cleader\u201d of Black feminism. In the book, Wallace called abolitionists like #HarrietTubman and #SojounerTruth \u201c#ugly\u201d and \u201c#stupid\u201d for supporting #Blackmen. She called #BlackRevolutionaries\" #chauvinistmachopigs\u201d and advised Black women to \u201c#goitalone.\u201d #GloriaSteinem said that Wallace\u2019s book would \u201cdefine the future of Black relationships\u201d and she pushed hard to make sure the book received massive publicity. Gloria Steinem\u2019s work triggered a flood of \u201cHate Black Men\u201d books and films that continues to this day. Needless to say, some were quite suspicious of Ms. Magazine and Gloria Steinem. Why was Steinem sticking her nose into the affairs of the Black community? So people started doing some research on Steinem. When it came out that Gloria Steinem was probably the ghost writer of the book with Michele Wallace\u2019s name on it, Wallace had a nervous breakdown and went into hiding for two years. However, the damage was already done and the \u201cHate Black Men\u201d movement was off and running. But the research into Gloria Steinem\u2019s background continued. What follows is the findings of many different researchers.\nThe so-called \u201c#BlackFeminist\u201d movement was created and #manipulated by the #CIA from the very beginning.\u00a0The only difference between Black Revolutionaries and Black Feminist on this issue is that the Black Revolutionaries KNOW they were infiltrated and manipulated\u2014But\u00a0Black Feminist are still unwilling to admit that they were infiltrated and manipulated, largely because they are highly invested in the hateful brand of #Blackfeminism. \nAs a result, the \u201c#HateBlackMen\u201d movement \"#timesup #metoo \u00a01850 and 1860 census data so far, showed #whitewomen make up about 40 percents of all #slavowners.\n53percents voted for #trump\nUndercover #racist liberal"

It\u2019s watching someone laugh at you when you try to explain toxic masculinity. It\u2019s worse when it\u2019s someone you love. I don\u2019t pretend to have all the answers but I\u2019m not going to ignore something that\u2019s right in front of me. I\u2019ve been in too many rooms where I didn\u2019t feel safe speaking my mind. I\u2019ve been in too many situations where I thought silence was better than making someone feel uncomfortable. I\u2019m not going to put aside someone\u2019s feelings and worth because you\u2019re uncomfortable. There are too many people out there that feel alone and I just want them to know that I believe in them and their voice. I won\u2019t shut up if you won\u2019t. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nPosted @withrepost \u2022 @hannahbelle.michelle \u201cI have a lot of things but one thing that I have never been able to shake is when I was in israel I was staying with other people from Penn state and these 2 boys who I was living with told me \u201cmy feminism was making people uncomfortable\u201d I have never felt more oppressed in that moment because I feel like that defines me and these boys telling me that I make people uncomfortable just made me so angry but I knew I couldn\u2019t react with anger because that would just make it worse. And because of that, they would never believe me when I talked about a cat calling or creepy guy that approached me in israel. Because I\u2019m \u201ctoo feminist\u201d. What does that even mean?\u201d - Amanda @mands417 \nHow many of you have had a similar accusation made of us!? \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fLike sorry, your misogyny, inability to learn, respect womxn, and be a decent human makes ME uncomfortable! \nAs always, send your stories to catscallingback@gmail.com or DM me. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n #ipadproart #illustration #illustratorsofinstagram #womenwhodraw #procreate #procreateart #womenofillustration \n#creative #girlssupportinggirls #girlpower #girlgang #streetharassment #harassmentstories #notyourbaby #timesup #metoo #femaleempowerment #womenempoweringwomen #womenempowerment #feminism #feminist #catscallingback #believewomen #ibelievewomen #israel #birthright"

According to HARRASSMENT OF WOMEN AT WORK PLACE ACT 2013,
DURING PENDENCY OF INQUIRY ,
INTERNAL COMMITTEE OR LOCAL COMMITTEE CAN TRANSFER THE AGGRIEVED WOMEN ON HER WRITTEN REQUEST. BUT DELHI EDUCATION DEPARTMENT TRANSFERRED THE VICTIM TEACHER WITHOUT HER CONSENT,EVEN ENQUIRY IS PENDING TILL DATE.
DELHI EDUCATION DEPARTMENT CORRUPT DIRECTORS OFFICERS TORTURING VICTIM GIRL TEACHER AND PASSED HER TRANSFER ORDER WHO HAS FILED COMPLAINT AGAINST SANJAY KUMAR SHARMA OF PATRACHAR VIDYALAYA SHALIMAR BAGH NEW DELHI . BECAUSE OF CRUILTY PARTIALITY &  THREATENINGS OF ACCUSED (PGT-GEOGRAPHY)SANJAY KUMAR SHARMA ,  AD-BABITA, DR-Y.MARKA,RD-RENU SHARMA,RANJANA DESHWAL, EX DIRECTOR-SAUMYA GUPTA & SANJAY GOEL ,  HOW CAN SHE GO TO JOB IF ALL CORRUPTS ACCUSED  ARE UNDER PROTECTION OF CORRUPT OFFICERS ?  HOW CAN VICTIM GIRL TEACHER FEEL SAFE AT WORK PLACE IF NO ONE HAS BEEN LISTENNING HER?  IS IT NOT OPEN SUPPORT TO ACCUSED SANJAY KUMAR SHARMA? IS IT NOT OPEN PARTIALITY ? IS IT NOT CORRUPTION CRUILTY ? IS IT THE WAY TO PUSH VICTIM GIRL TEACHER TO DO SUICIDE ? 
IS IT NOT WRONG MESSAGE TO ALL STAFF OF DELHI EDUCATION DEPARTMENT THAT "HARRASS THE VICTIM TEACHER BUT NO ONE WILL PUNISH ACCUSED STAFF" ? AD BABITA HAD TWO DAUGHTERS, WHY NOT SAME HARRASSMENT WITH THEIR DAUGHTERS, AFTER THAT BABITA WILL UNDERSTAND THE PAIN OF INNOCENT VICTIM TEACHER ?
WHO WILL LISTEN VICTIM TEACHER ?
WHEN WILL RESPONSIBLE MINISTERS & OFFICERS AWAKE & GIVE JUSTICE TO VICTIM TEACHER WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SAFETY OF WOMEN AT WORK PLACE?

Just a little bite of some yummy news 🍕🍔😝 This summer I'll be learning how to EmpowHER myself and others with the support of the @barudolphfoundation. EmpowHER has selected a group of women for 2019 who are bold, unapologetic, and ready to spark change. 💃🏼 While interning in Washington, DC this summer, I'll be working w/ @BARudolphFND to empower the voices of women at both a national and global level. 🙏🏼

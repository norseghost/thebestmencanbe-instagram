Originally the MeToo movement began in 2006  by Tarana Burke. Being a survivor of sexual assault, she started the movement to help others who also had also survived sexual violence. Later in 2017, famous actress, Ashley Judd, accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and multiple other women came out with their own cases. On October 15, 2017, actress Alyssa Milano tweeted "If you've been sexually assaulted or harassed write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet." Many began to share their stories.

A few days after the first MeToo Tweet, several gymnasts, including Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney, revealed a former team doctor, Lawrence G Nassar, of sexual harassment and assault. Recently he has been sentenced to 60 years in federal prison. In December 2017 Time Magazine featured the women who launched the MeToo movement, calling them the Silence Breakers.

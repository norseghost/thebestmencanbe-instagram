I often struggle to leave the house. When the confines of four walls become unbearable, I force myself out into the isolated expanses of the rugged moorland which surrounds my house. Sometimes I can walk miles with my senses completely shut off from the element-worn beauty all around me and other times I am free of the memories which would otherwise distract me. Today was one of those days. #metoo #survivor #abusesurvivor #childsexualexploitation #sexualabuse #recovery

After years we still have to fight for this right. The movement is back after over 10 years of silence. In those years nothing changed. Sexual abusing is so common in South Korea although it shouldnâ€™t be. You shouldnâ€™t tell yourself that you have to get over it because itâ€™s normal, you shouldnâ€™t tell yourself itâ€™s your fault if youâ€™re get raped bc of your clothes...this is called victim blaming and slut shaming. And this shouldnâ€™t be. People donâ€™t get raped for their clothes. Btw this doesnâ€™t apply just for women but also for men. Tell someone and speak up for your right! We can stop this together ðŸ”¥

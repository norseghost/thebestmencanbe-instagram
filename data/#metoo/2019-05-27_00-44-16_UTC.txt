Time Machine (trailer)
Please follow the link in my bio. 
This animation contains scenes of sexual assault and violence.
Viewer discretion is advised.

What would you do if one of your family members or friends told you that he or she was sexually assaulted?

The victims of sexual assault are often blamed. Some people say the victim's behavior causes the sexual assault. But, this isn't true.
It happens when a person decides to hurt someone. It is never a victim's fault.

Victims need to be listened to, and they need to be believed.

When someone talks to you about their experience, please remember that they are talking to you because they trust you.

If you believe them, you can help them.

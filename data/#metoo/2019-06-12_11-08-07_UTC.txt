This meal is my comfort food & it pisses me off to death if it doesn taste perfect. These sandwiches were good liken had so much extra amount of mayonnaise which made them very heavy, less chicken, flooded with cabbage aur  banaei walay ne cheese bus uper se guzzar dea tha shayad. Near to none cheese pissed me off basically :p fries were good, I like their fries. Always good !!! Club Sandwiches @vintagecafekarachi are not at all recommended . (2/2) // Fit day start tomorrow

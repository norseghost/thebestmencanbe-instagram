It has been a privilege to provide ongoing commentary for the newly launched @courttvnetwork during the first trial they are covering live, the #KellenWinslowII rape trail. 
This is a profound #metoo moment case meets the #sports world. Hereâ€™s a clip from my commentary today, live from the court house in San Diego County. The prosecution needs to call a forensic physiologist who specializes in sexual abuse victims to testify that it is normal and customary for sexual abuse victims to refrain from reporting rape because of fear, retaliation, humiliation, and concern that nobody will believe them. 
You can now stream this stellar network with great coverage on crime themed programs for free on Fire TV, Apple TV, Youtube, & Facebook. You can also stream Court TV on their website CourtTV.com

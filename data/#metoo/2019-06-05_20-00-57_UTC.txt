Heels, loafers, flats, or kicks — which shoes a woman wears in the workplace should be her choice. In Japan, however, many women are required to wear heels to work, and now thousands of them have had enough. Nearly 20,000 people have signed a petition calling on the government to ban such policies. The petition is part of the #KuToo campaign — a play on the Japanese words for shoe, “kutsu,” and pain, “kutsuu,” that pays homage to the #MeToo movement — started by actress and freelancer Yumi Ishikawa, pictured here. Ishikawa first took notice of such gender discriminatory dress codes when she started training for a job at a hotel. She was required to wear heels throughout training sessions, during which she had to stand for hours at a time. Gender inequality can appear in myriad ways in the workplace, from overt sexual harassment to unequal pay to dress codes that discriminate against women in more subtle ways. In order to empower women and achieve equality for all, it is necessary to tackle all facets of gender-based discrimination, and campaigns like #KuToo in Japan are helping to start conversations about sexist workplace practices.

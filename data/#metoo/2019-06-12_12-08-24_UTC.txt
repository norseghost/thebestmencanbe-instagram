We need to insist on media coverage and the presence of human rights investigators to be allowed in the genocide zone and we need international pressure until the Myanmar government and the Buddhist leaders of extremist groups reverse their positions on the innocent Rohingya people. Myanmar must repatriate them, provide them with resources (which could be raised by other countries), give them  back their citizenship and freedom, and let them live in peace. They deserve their basic human rights back. Spread the word, stop the silence and end the genocidal violence!

Oh little angel,
They said you weren’t an angel anymore,
They touched you with hands dipped in lust,
And took your halo away.
You felt stripped naked without the assurity that it wasn’t you who was dirty.
But then you heard the voice of another sister,
Who didn’t hide her scars but wore them as an armour.
She made you realise that it wasn’t the halo that had made you an Angel but the light that came from within you.

Repost @emptyeverycage: "This is Baby Gluay Hom

His tiny face is haunting me... You can see he's lost all hope to live... The scars and wounds tell the level of brutality he's endured from those who have this precious life just suffering. This baby only 4 and they have already taken everything of the life he was actually meant to live... All because of the Tourist industry. If we don't stop paying to see them as circus freaks we will never end their suffering..... Baby #Gluay Hom is  being tortured in #Samut #Prakan #Crocodile #Farm and #Zoo in #Thailand.

Introducing my Ela teacher Mr.covington 
It's hard looking at that mugshot. Looking in those eyes; the eyes that I once found comfort in but now I fear. He was my favorite teacher. He would always let me and my best friend talk in his class. When I was dealing with my mental breakdown he would check on my best friend everyday and make sure she's doing alright. When I came back from my first hospitalization he told me he was there for me and he's glad I was back. When I was at my placement I'd write heartfelt letters to him explaining that I'm grateful to have him in my life. He was funny, understanding and would assist me and my best friend  through our  anxiety. I would always be looking forward to fourth core to see him. I wanted to impress him with my writing. I tusted this man. I respected him. I adored him. I was wrong in doing so.

Some people at my school think he's being framed but as someone who knows what it's like to be provoked by a trusting adult I stand by whoever this person may be. I'm not saying I'm 100% sure he did it but I'm not going to blindly follow the selective few people in my school who believes he's innocentl just because it's hard for them to believe someone whos as nice as him could do such a sinister act. People told me "he's a nice guy, how could he do this?" My abuser was a old, trusted, "nice" guy yet here I am trying to die because the traumas to real. My abuser was as close to me as I am with my best friend. I'd run to his room everyday to talk to him all about my day. It's the same exact excitement I got when I went to my teachers class.  People aren't always what they seem to be. Looks can be deceiving. This event has taught me that I can't trust anyone. Not my family, not my friends, not my idols. Humans are cruel. Everyone is wearing a mask it seems.

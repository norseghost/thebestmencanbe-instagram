Privilege: at this time in my life...
I am privileged to live where I choose, go back to school to pursue my mission focused doctorate AND say what i think OUT LOUD.

Here is what I care about: our planet and the earths creatures...ESPECIALLY the female humans, cause frankly, they get short shrift and have FOREVER. I’ve lived #metoo, I know the smaller paychecks only too well as well as the explanations behind them. 
I see the destruction that my chosen industry and my actions within that industry as a designer waged upon our precious natural resources. 
As a professor, I’ve tried hard to make sure that my students have learned to put meaning and purpose into their work before they squeezed out their priorities to expand their profits. As a mentor, i continue to do the same work.

Fashion world: stop being disgusting. 
Fashion Press: stop pandering to the celebrities and the bad eggs!

Consumers: get educated on what fits you and your life, buy less, buy better and care for what you already own! 
Designers: use your creativity for good not just pretty, learn how to be responsible in your choices! 
I intend to make a few more dents.

That’s me in the cat eye sunglasses on the right, out in front of the Massachusetts State House (the scene of one of my #metoo dramaz), protesting against the draconian, unconstitutional incursion into women’s reproductive rights. My first abortion rights rally was thirty years ago when I was 21, and it reminded me of the last photo I’ve posted in this series.  It’s from the Women’s March held in 2016, and it’s an older woman commenting in disbelief “I can’t believe I still have to protest this fucking shit.” Word to the mutha. #stopthebans #prochoice #thisiswhatdemocracylookslike #abortionrights #protectwomen #womensrights #fucktrump 🖕✊👊💪😤😠🤬📣🇺🇸🤦🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️💃

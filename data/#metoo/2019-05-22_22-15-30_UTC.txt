I’m not sure if any of you have heard about this but it’s fucked up. There was a report about it playing on our TVs at school today and our vp changed it. I asked him why he he said, “people might get upset.” Like damn. People should get upset. That is the correct response. If someone isn’t upset or outraged about this then they are the problem.

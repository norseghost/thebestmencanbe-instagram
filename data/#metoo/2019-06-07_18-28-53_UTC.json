                        "text": "I am REALLY angry right now. Read to the end to see why.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nLet me catch you up:\n\ud83d\udd3bDr. Guillermo Andres Cortes, a cardiologist at USC, sexually assaulted multiple women, including trainees in his program.\n\ud83d\udd3bHe locked one in a call room and penetrated one vaginally with his finger (uncomfortable? Good).\n\ud83d\udd3bHe was placed on leave but allowed to return before the investigation was complete.\n\ud83d\udd3bSince then his license has been stripped as he has been deemed \u201ca risk of immediate and serious injury to the public\u201d if allowed to continue practicing medicine.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nUSC failed its trainees in allowing him to practice again. They did not report the allegations to the medical board and only took action once word got out in public. In light of this, the USC cardiology fellowship program will close down in 2020.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nPer a current USC resident, a new program is set to start the day after the current one closes to allow for continuation of training, but under new leadership.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nSo why am I mad?\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nBecause in May on Doximity, a PHYSICIAN wrote an article about how closing the program was an overreaction. That it isn't fair and goes to far. Heck, he/she even called it \"Sexual harassment\" and not even sexual assault - which it was - HUGE difference.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nOther doctors have since commented, and here is why I am REALLY upset. Some agree, and one female physician even said the following: \"Are we not grownups? If someone harasses me, I harass right back. Trainees these days are so weak. What a stupid overreaction. Excuse me while I go cry about everyone who ever did something mean to me. Oh, JK haha.\"\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nThis is a WOMAN. A physician who took an oath to do no harm.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nThis is why victims don't come forward. Why should they when doctors in power tell them to just get even?\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nI can't. I don't get it.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nPlease, women out there - know we physicians are not all like this. I will listen to you. I will support you. Please speak up. You are worth it.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n#women #womenmatter #sexualharassment #predator #assault #metoo #timesup #timesuphc #timesuphealthcare #humanrights #tothegirls #somedocs"

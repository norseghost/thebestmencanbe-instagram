This is how we have survived a weekend of outdoor activities from fishing at the park to backyard movies without getting eaten alive! 
My DIY Young Living Essential Oils Bug Spray not only smells amazing but keeps 🐜 🐛 🦟  away free of Deet & other harmful chemicals! This is definitely the only spray I will use with Hudson! 
Bye Bye Bugs!!!! DIY Bug Off Spray to keep you enjoying outside annoyance free!

2 oz bottle
5 drops of each: 
Citronella
Lemongrass
Peppermint
Purification
Geranium (optional I added for gnats/ ticks) 
¼ part Witch Hazel
¾ part Distilled Water 
Can be altered for little ones to: 2 drops each of Purification, Citronella, & Lavender.
This is the one I use for Hudson!

We are all shaped by our pasts, the good and the bad, and some are more affected negatively than others and vice versa, dependent upon whether we had happy or deeply traumatic (or somewhere in between) lives, especially as children during critical developmental years.

Yet, our pasts don’t have to define us and our futures. Through treatment (therapy, medication, recovery program, etc) and hard work, we can change the trajectory of our lives. That doesn’t mean everyone can completely overcome the damage from the past as we will carry the scars with us, so don’t beat yourself up if the past still pulls on you like an undertow. It just means we can grow and change and things can get better.

EGO
I once painted this small scene. It is Semar, a characteristic mythology Wayang figure. Presented as a clown, but in fact he is divine and very very wise. The sacred Dhanyang (Guardian Spirit) of Java, Indonesia. Sita is the wife of Rama and involved in a legendary fire ritual. That telling is so breathtaking,  so she is talking about with Semar. I showed my little art work to a Javanese friend and he whispered "Sepih Pamrih". Something like "good conduct of life, good morality". Someone who helps other sincerely, without asking anything in return. Sounds familiar. Free from selfinterest? Nowadays??? Is that whats my painting is about? Did I think about that in 1998?

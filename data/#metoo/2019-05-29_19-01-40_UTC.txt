They say to marry your best friend, but I never even understood what it was like to date your best friend until I met Ty. Now I know 100% what it’s like to be in a relationship with your very best friend. It’s slumber parties everyday, all the pizza you can eat, driving twelve hours to California on a random weekend, skateboarding at empty skateparks at 3am, so many memes, holding hands to fall asleep every night, never being alone, always having a shoulder to cry on, and a reason to smile. •

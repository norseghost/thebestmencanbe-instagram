one of my favorite quotes ðŸ’›
happy tuesday! iâ€™ve had to wake up at 8am the past few days and it surprisingly hasnâ€™t been that hard. iâ€™m not a morning person at all and i usually sleep in until noon (shoutout depression) but iâ€™ve been feeling really well rested lately?? what is this feeling? is this how normal people feel in the mornings? have i unlocked the secret to happy and healthy life?? i havenâ€™t been able to function off of anything less than 10-12 hours of sleep since i was like 18 and having chronic fatigue means even that much sleep is never enough. iâ€™m  feeling so good today after only 7ish hours of sleep and i donâ€™t feel exhausted or like i need a nap to survive. alsoâ€” i got a really great job today in one of my favorite areas of portland and iâ€™m so excited! working has always been hard for me, both mentally and physically, i have social anxiety and my chronic illness makes standing or exerting any type of energy very difficult. but iâ€™m still doing really well mentally and i feel ready to get back out there, yay me! feeling extra blessed and grateful today ðŸŒŸ

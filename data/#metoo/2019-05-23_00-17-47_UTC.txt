ðŸŒ± Growing ðŸŒ± This month, Tough as Milk, in partnership with the @adamhsboardcc and the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Justice Center, launched a trauma-informed yoga program for male teens in the detention center. We added three new teachers to the Tough as Milk team, @dopesoul_yoga , Wendy and Dan. All three with extensive experience in working with trauma survivors and/or teens. Words cannot express how honored and inspired we are to work with these students. This growth is possible because of YOU, our community. Thank you for believing in our vision, spreading the word and donating. If you are interested in supporting our efforts through donations or hosting a Shift fundraiser, visit toughasmilk.org âœ¨ The picture above was made in art therapy by the students. The squares representing the galaxy with their hopes and dreams attached to their piece.

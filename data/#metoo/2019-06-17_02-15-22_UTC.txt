Wow I found this public Court Document On retired adult Film Actress /Vivid Radio Host Christy Canyon aka Melissa Conway getting a Lawsuit for sexual harassment and Racial Discrimination towards a Black female co-worker named Terri Hughes. Terri Hughes was a co-Host for PlayBoy Radio along with Christy Canyon of a show called “ NightCalls”, Terri was the only Black Radio Host at PlayBoy Radio at the time and Christy Canyon would taunt her for it along with sexually harassing her and trying to force her to do things she didn’t want. Terri Hughes got fed up and filed and Lawsuit against Christy Canyon and PlayBoy Radio and won. Just look at all the charges filed against Christy Canyon on the right. She caused a lot of damages to Terri Hughes. This is public information on a public figure made viewable to the public, I’m not trying to shame anyone this is fair use of a civil public document. Sexual Harassment and Racial Discrimination In Jobs is a real serious issue we cannot continue to let people get away with this fight back like Terri Hughes did.

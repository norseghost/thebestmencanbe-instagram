Allow yourself to fall into trust ~ have you yet read Oprah’s new book, “The Path Made Clear”? If not, I highly recommend it!
.
This quote, “allow yourself to fall into trust” was from Oprah’s interview with William Paul Young.  I found it to be profound and inspirational. .
When things are stressful, unknown, or less than pleasant, trust in yourself and trust in the process.  It is real easy to get worked up, anxious, and spin out of control.  Instead, override these feelings and stay calm ~ trust the situation and trust yourself that you will figure it out and that all will work out for you. You’ve got this! 💜

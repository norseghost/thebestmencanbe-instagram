Caitlin Moran's 'How To Be Famous' was a bit of a detour from my usual, but it was an easy and witty read through 90s Camden; exploring the music/media scene and echoing the 'Me Too' movement of more recent years.

The reading experience was similar to how I find Lena Dunham's work, so not entirely my cup of tea but certainly a rosy and nostalgic trip down memory lane - best served with a Britpop playlist.ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽµ #howtobefamous #caitlinmoran #britpop #camden #hardback #fiction #metoo #bookstagram #writersofinstagram #london #bibliophile #theberlagebookshelf #bookstack #booksofinsta #bookreview #bookaddict #bestseller #howtobuildagirl

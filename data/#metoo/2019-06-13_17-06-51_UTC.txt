Being a sexual assault counselor, you learn the ins and outs of a city's Sexual Assault Response Team, which typically includes the local rape crisis center, the sexual assault nurse examiners, the Special Victims Unit, the D.A.'s Office, and Victim Advocates. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You hear from survivors how they experience the sexual assault kit exam, the reporting, investigation, and prosuection process - if it ever gets to that point. Over and over again, you hear survivors' frustration with how law enforcement officials treat them and how the process is not set up to serve them. And that is the truth. The system was NEVER set up to serve survivors. We have proof of that. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
My research shows that in "liberal" San Francisco, of the 757 reports of adult sexual assault in 2016, 297 were investigated (39%), 91 referred to the D.A. (12%), and 11 cases of adult AND child sexual assault actually went to trial (1.5%). These stats are low compared to other crimes and they are not specific to San Francisco. This is the case all over the country, in cities like Austin, where survivors and their advocates are actually suing the City for failing to prosecute sexual assault. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Survivors ARE being denied equal access to legal justice all across the country. And sadly, anti-sexual violence advocacy orgs are stretched thin and mainly focus their efforts on national and state policy - some of which affects local issues - but more often than not, advocates for reform at the local level are lacking resources and political power. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
That's why I'm here. To build the movement for rape reform at the local level, where the policies are most felt by survivors in the immediate aftermath of their assault.

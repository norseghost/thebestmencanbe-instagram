This is unacceptable and sadly not surprising. The US ranks as the 10th most dangerous place in the world for women and the ONLY western democracy in the top ten. “The report attributes the inclusion of the U.S. in the list to the rise of the #MeToo movement that has helped uncover the near-ubiquity of sexual harassment. In fact, the U.S. and Syria tied for third for the risks women face in terms of sexual violence, harassment, sexual coercion, and women’s lack of access to justice in cases of rape.”
I stand with those marching today against the abortion bans.  The bans further endanger the lives of women in this country. Women should be the only ones making decisions about their bodies and health. #stopthebans #keepwomensafe #mybodymychoice #justiceforwomen #equalityforwomen #stopviolenceagainstwomen

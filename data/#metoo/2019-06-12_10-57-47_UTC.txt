Nigeria should rise to the challenge of contributing to the sustenance of democracy. The government at the federal, state and local level should work hard to overcome the shortcomings of democratic rule.

Long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

Happy Democracy Day from African Women in Leadership Organisation..

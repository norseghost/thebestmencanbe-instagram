I’m going to be brave tonight. I will speak out on what has happened to me years ago. Sharing makes you stronger. Not many people know this happened to me and I never told the police. My brother ended up telling them though. One night I was bored and wanted to drink. I called up a mutual friend and was talking about going for a few drinks. These few drinks turned into a 40 of vodka that I was chugging. The guy I was with (who was like 50) was driving us around with our “truck drinks”. All of a sudden I was fucking wasted out of my mind and he was talking shit about my brother so I flipped out and jumped out of the truck. He followed me and I started pushing him away from me then he threw me to the ground and all I remember is him being on top of me...I remember him reach back in his back pocket...he grabbed his truck key, shoved it down the front of my pants and started keying the front of my area down there. I was horrified and I punched him in the face 3 times and spit in his face repeatedly. I finally got him off me and i fucking RAN. I got home and I was severely injured. The bruises were so bad 😢 This was a nightmare I got myself into and I thought it was my fault that this happened to me because I was drunk. I will never put myself in that position EVER AGAIN. So if I get close to you and you wonder why I act a little off - that’s probably why. It still terrifies me to this day. I am stronger because of this though. 🙏🏼💕 #sobriety #recovery #metoo

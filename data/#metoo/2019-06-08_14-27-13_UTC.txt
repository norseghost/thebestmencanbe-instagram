Thank you to all those who have helped to provide me with a greater perspective and understanding on how to be a supportive ally. 
Here are some thoughts that have been shared with me by others. 🥰 “For allies, those who aren’t LGBTQ but come out to show support, it’s important to keep the focus on the real meaning of Pride and be aware of when — and in what capacity — your presence is appreciated.” “Allies need to know when their voice is needed and appreciated, and when it is not.” “During Pride, in particular, realize that while your attendance is welcome, the event isn’t for you, nor is it an excuse to get drunk and be disruptive.” “Going to an LGBTQ friend or loved one can remind allies of the purpose of the event.” Happy Pride  from Washington DC 🌈🌈🌈

                        "text": "\u201cIt's my personal struggle, it probably will always be. I've never hit a day of perfection. Driven women, especially who come to New York, they want to hit financial goals. I'm generalizing so maybe I should just speak for myself. I have had financial goals I've wanted to hit. I wanted to fall in love, get married, have two kids, a boy and a girl. I wanted to have a big career and do it all while not gaining any weight, having awesome clothes and having a great time with my friends, being with my family and loving everyone that I work with. All of those things have happened they just did not happen the way I thought. I have an almost 4 month old daughter and I have a 3 year old son and I'm getting divorced. I'm shifting everything during my day to figure out how to be at a 4 o'clock Valentines day party at my son's school. I'm still nursing and my pumping schedule is always off because of work stuff. My Nanny is the most important person in my life, I can't do life without her. I've had to embrace people helping me, which I was way too good for that before.  Even if I had a Nanny I had to do everything on my own.  When I was pregnant this last time I was so, so, sick, I didn't feel good. I had to raise my hand and say, \u201cI can't be at a meeting I need someone to cover it\u201d. These are things that attacked me at my core. Having to say I'm failing, I'm not doing a great job at something, I don't feel good, I'm having a day, I need help- but they are required sometimes. They forced me to look at myself and say \u201cOk you're not perfect and your not on this trajectory of perfection but what can you do everyday to feel good and still embrace this time.\u201d - Nicole Baker, Owner & Partner, Studio Office Solutions\n\nLink in bio to listen to the full interview with Nicole.

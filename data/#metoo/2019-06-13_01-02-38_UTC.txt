Hey guys. About a year ago Jeremy Hanks (aka Margo) died of a drug overdose. About year before that I fell in love with him knowing he had a felony for domestic abuse.  I left when he assualted me. I recieved legal advice and decided not to press charges. I've been in therapy for about 2 years, learning to cope with the trauma he inflicted. I learned a lot from the situation.  I learned not to ignore red flags and I discovered a latent love of music. I'm not proud that I allowed myself to be manipulated, but I am proud that I survived. It's taken a lot of time and self-care to be able to stand up and finally say, #Metoo ... & in the same breath, I pray he can finally rest.

About 3 years ago, I moved to Arizona from New York City with only 3 luggages and my dog. It was a very hard decision to leave my family/friends in order to work on my career as well as my personal journey and to become more of my personal guidance system than I had been used to.

But I did it. Despite of the fear, the judgements, and at times feeling alone, I found peace and comfort within myself and learned thereâ€™s so much more than living in fear and discomfort.

Itâ€™s up to you to find yourself. To love yourself. To make yourself uncomfortable in order to grow. To know and to remind yourself when you have bad days that it does it get better. To know that no matter where you journey, no matter where you appear to be, you are exactly where you need to be. And everything you need is within YOU. You have the ability to give yourself all that you need and what you are longing and searching for.

You have the right to be free from your suffering and at times your story ðŸ’•

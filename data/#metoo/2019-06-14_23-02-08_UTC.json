                        "text": "\u201cThe Not Invisible Act of 2019 , a Bill to increase intergovernmental coordination to identify and combat violent crime within Indian lands and of Indians. This is a start to addressing MMIW and MMIWG. We, as a society, as a nation, we have to start recognizing that Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women/Girls needs to be addressed immediately. Moreover, women and within the contemporary feminist movement, #MMIWG needs to be at the top of the #MeToo Movement. Historically, Women of Color (WOC) in the United States have been considered disposable, and even not human. We must be aware of settler colonialism, and how it affects Native peoples today. We have to change our mindsets about trauma and understand that trauma doesn't just exist in the past. Trauma radiates through generations, and into the now. The degeneration of Indigenous people is because of the deliberate extermination of the Indigenous populace. Indigenous people have been exposed to traumas stemmed in precise historical losses. This is an all-encompassing loss of identity and culture, a loss of family and a loss of land. This trauma and loss had been passed down, then reverberates though generations today. In acknowledging the trauma, one also needs to recognize the perpetrators, and in doing so, we allow for public acknowledgment of the harms done by a dominant culture. In this acknowledgement, we then humanize Native/Indigenous Women and Girls. Therefore they become important and worthy of legislation, taking a precedence, along with priority in media coverage.\u201d -pj cantu #mmiw #mmiwg #mmiwgt2s #nomorestolensisters #metoo #themtoo #decolonizefeminism #intersectionalfeminism"

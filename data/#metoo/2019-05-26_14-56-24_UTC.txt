All across the #USA our tax dollars are being used to fund military bases around the world. Bases that are not protecting any country, especially your own. Bases that are EXPENSIVE and producing huge amounts of CO2 emissions. The US military is the single largest consumer and emitter of fossil fuels. It's time for us to wake up from the collective fear nightmare paradigm and reimagine love. Love makes all things possible. 
SHUT DOWN THE BASES
INVEST IN A PEACE ECONOMY
IT'S THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN

#metoo movement calling for the rights of women's bodies and personal spaces being respected resonates at the same frequency as #indigenous #firstnations people calling for the respect and autonomy of their land and we all know #waterislife yet seem to have forgotten #flint still has filthy water because of #corruption & #racism and this type of #colorism and #other labeling is how people justify remaining silent in the face of #humanrights atrocities and obvious acts of terror sanctioned by their own governments.

He said smile more I said give me a reason to. Maybe that’s just how I feel. Maybe that’s how your perverted stares and comments make me feel. Maybe I’m tired. Maybe it’s my body. Maybe it’s my mouth. Just maybe.🤷🏽‍♀️ can we please stawp policing women’s bodies in 2019, can we. “Oh baby girl you look so much prettier when you smile.” Well you sir  probably looked soo much better 20 years ago but I didn’t come up and tell you that did I? Two can play. Y’all don’t want me to play. I promise you don’t. Y’all be in denial. I don’t lie to myself when I look in the mirror but you and all your friends are lying to yourselves. And when that’s the case I can hurt you with your own truth. I own mine. I’m not trying to be young when I’m old. I’m not telling myself I still got it when I don’t. But hey sir are you happy now I smiled and laughed while writing this. You’d be proud. 😊

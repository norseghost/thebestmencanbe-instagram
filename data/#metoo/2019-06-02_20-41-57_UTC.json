                        "text": "-TRIVIAL THOUGHTS as a result of sexual assault-\n\nFull interview of Robert Uttaro in Apr/May 2019 issue (link in bio):\nSexual violence teaches people lies about themselves, and the lies can be smothering and overpowering. When those thoughts come, a person can try to replace them with truthful thoughts. Acknowledge the thought has come and then say \u201cNo, this isn\u2019t right. This is not true. This is not me.\u201d Repeat good, truthful thoughts to yourself. I cannot tell you how many times a rape survivor and I will go back and forth on something that is not true. So many people really do blame themselves and are blamed, but the truth is they are not to blame. One woman I know of was raped on the street by a stranger, and she constantly thinks that she shouldn\u2019t have walked outside that night. It breaks my heart. Is she not supposed to walk down the street? Think of all the other times she has walked on the street and nothing bad happened to her. And then on this one night, she is violently raped and left to pick up the pieces years later. When the negative thoughts come and she expresses them to me, I continue to tell her that she did nothing wrong and that there is nothing wrong with walking down the street. There is nothing wrong with going to hang out with a friend. What is wrong is another person choosing to commit a vile crime. I hope and pray anyone reading this understands the difference between truth and lies.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n#toimagazine #rapecrisis #rapecrisiscounselor #sexualassault #sexualassaultawareness #sexualviolence #mentalhealthawareness #thoughts #metoo #eatingdisorderrecovery #dissociativeidentitydisorder #cptsd #ptsd #shame"

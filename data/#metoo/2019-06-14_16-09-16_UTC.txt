A very thoughtful article on the question has the #metoo movement veered too far away from its original intention, to expose sexual violence and bullying behavior. The phrase coined by activist Tarana Burke, was to remove the shame and support survivors of sexual abuse to speak out if they so choose without fear of backlash. But it seems social media has a bandwagon effect and is potentially turning the coined hashtag into a vindictive plot against men. So much so at the risk of setting us back not moving us forward if a balance isn’t found. The article goes on to mention the extremes to which this effect is having. paramedics afraid to resuscitate women out of fear of being accused of inappropriate touching and such cases have tripled since the movement. In the workplace the new era is “avoid women at all cost”. Some executives are no longer willing to sit next to women on business flights, no one on one lunch meetings, booking rooms on separate hotel floors. The writer recalls a time when she wanted to have a meeting with her boss to talk about career advancement. He would only meet with her with the door wide open earshot for all other employees to hear the conversation. She felt she was unable to be honest about her career goals with other people listening. But it seems this is the direction this movement is headed. Definitely a sensitive topic hopefully we will find a balance that will not set us back to the 19th century.

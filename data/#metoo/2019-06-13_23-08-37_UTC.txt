I’ve reached a place in my life where I’ve realized the only time I should make for people is when we’re talking about growing our minds, our bodies, our hearts, or our bank accounts. @glamgirldaniella is all of that rolled into one, a true treasure of a friend. You are a powerfully beautiful friend, and I’m grateful we’ve always been able to lift each other up. The Bay loves you girl, and so does the rest of the world. What a gift. 
If you’re not growing, you’re dying. Let’s live. ❤️

black women are gorgeous, no matter how light or dark they are. I'm so happy to see black girl magic cuz that shit is real and they deserve to be empowered. they deserve to feel confident. their skin color and features arent  your fetish. they are full of wonder and beauty and they deserve to be treated like the queens that they are. that's it that's the post -alex

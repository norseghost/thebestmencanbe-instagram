@beautiful.disaster310 Proud moment my Students work ‼️😍😍 ! With the correct training you too could lash confidently like this ! ‼️Don’t be the girl who trained with trainer doing it for the money booking 20plus people in a class leaving unsatisfied no live model training and not being able to offer the service upon completion with no supervision 🤷🏽‍♀️ Success takes Skills, Skills take practice, Practice takes work, and work takes time!! Put that work in and in DUE TIME you'll be counting all your blessings on your mission to success❤️I love when my students take their trainings as serious as I do! I don't just want your money!!! I want you to know what you're doing CONFIDENTLY!!! And to be able to COMFORTABLY service your clients  alone❤️ One on one trainings are also available! #kyliejennner #kimk #bellalash #minnimalleaveout #sidepart #noleaveout  #labraider #snatched  #jordans #lashtraining #fashionnova #fullheadweave #lashes #lashtraining #love  #mac #makeup #hairgoals  #nailart #lazalonso #rickross #tiakemp #queenscourt #khia #tsmadison #migos #joselinehernandez #metoo #kirkfrost #ccurl #dcurl

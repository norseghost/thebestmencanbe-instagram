One of our main aims at Heed, is to break the taboo of talking about sexual violence and ultimately shed the shame that survivors feel. Feeling alone, like you deserved it or even doubting youâ€™re in any danger because the abuse has been normalised are all factors that come in to play. YOU are not alone, YOU deserve the fucking world and it is NOT normal or OK and you DONT have to pretend anymore. 
We want to encourage women affected by sexual violence to speak out, tell their story, build back confidence and find a little bit of solace in knowing we are here and we are all in it together. Even if you are no where near being able to talk about it or never want to, everyoneâ€™s journey is unique and personal to them! I just hope you see this post and know that you are worthy, you did nothing wrong, we love you and are so proud youâ€™re still here ðŸ’•
We will be posting information about places you can seek help or advice on this page for those affected and their family and friends, but please feel free to DM us for this info ahead of time!! #heed #heedempoweringwomen #breakthetaboo #shedtheshame #unashamed #letstalk #womensrights #metoo #standup #speakout #whatdoyouthink #youropinionmatters #basingstoke #basingstokecommunity #empoweringquotes #communitysupport #womensequality #basingstokeanddeane #femaleempowerment #strongwomen #hampshire #empoweredwomen #empoweredwomenempowerwomen #girlpower #itsoknottobeok #mentalhealthawareness

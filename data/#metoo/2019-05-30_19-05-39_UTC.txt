These numbers are scary, I get it. These number are hard to talk about, I get it. It’s absolutely terrifying to admit what happened. It terrifying that you lost your voice. That beautiful voice your mother told to you to use or your strength to push him away. I PROMISE I get it. I’ve been in those shoes.

The struggle was real. The war was hard but here I am today. Today I feel free of guilt, the shame, the why me I’ve been holding onto for so long. I’m so stinking lucky my story gets to keep going. Things could have been different.

So today I stand a little taller, I smile a little bigger. I’m so damn proud of that woman in that photo. She has battled some huge giants and yet she still stands today.🤟🏻

Advice: it’s okay to cry, to scream, to talk, to talk to a friend, find a therapist. It’s okay to use your voice you don’t have to walk around with that boulder on your chest.❤️

In last #selfie post daring it may seem, is a tool of ego strengthening. Ego loves an enemy. 
It will make an enemy out of person, place, social network etc. If you hear an underlying complaint this is your sign. If a person uses sarcasm to joke you down - guess that he/she is doing? Yes, strengthening the ego. 
Ego seeks to identify. Loathes titles. It does it in the positive: I m an artist. Or in the victim hood: the #metoo movement.
Be weary of ego as it will use all ðŸ§° to strengthen itself against anything really.
You are so much more! Beyond the limits of identity.

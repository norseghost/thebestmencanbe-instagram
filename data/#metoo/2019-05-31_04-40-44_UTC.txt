If our brains are trapped in trauma patterns telling us that being powerful is unsafe, we will not be able to hold power within us. Before we can talk about empowerment then, we must establish a sense of internal safety by removing false cognitions taught by trauma narratives. For me, my life was threatened if I spoke out about incest abuse, so I kept silent to self-protect. The anxiety and fear that I feel as Iâ€™m learning to share my story directly competes with my desperate desire to do so. I am reminded in my new community that I am safe now to share. As I root myself in this safety, I feel more empowered to share more openly. What do you feel empowered to do? Are your trauma patterns getting in the way of pursuing your dreams? .

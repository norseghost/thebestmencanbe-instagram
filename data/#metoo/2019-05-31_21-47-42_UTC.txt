~may 31, 2019~
today is the last day of mental health awareness month and i just want to give a quick shoutout 
to everyone who battles with mental illness 
to anyone who wakes up each morning wishing they didnâ€™t and fighting through the day
to everyone who has gotten help
to everyone who hasnâ€™t brushed their hair in days cause theyâ€™re too depressed to do a damn thing
to everyone whoâ€™s grades are as low as they are
to everyone who is trying their hardest to make it through the day
to everyone who has needed to distract themself from one pain and focus on another
to anyone has taken or attempted to take their life
to everyone who has trauma
to everyone who is too anxious to get out of the car
to everyone whoâ€™s dark imagination comes alive
to everyone who is bullied and walks the halls everyday, facing the one who makes you feel like you donâ€™t belong 
to everyone who rips themself apart every time they look in the mirror 
to everyone who has been broken so severely that nothing helps
to those whose compulsions take over themselves and they now feel as though they are their OCD
to everyone who is struggling
to my babies from McLean SE who are the most inspirational people i know
to my best friends for sticking with me and fighting by my side
to my family who has done everything they can to help me heal
to my entire professional support system
to ms grace carolyn didemonico
to all of you, 
you are strong
you are loved
you are beautiful 
you are intelligent
you are worth it
you are not alone
you are so incredibly loved 
keep fighting because life is beautiful. it may not seem that way now, but i promise youâ€™ll get there. time to prove your strength to your demons and show them how badass you are. time to see brighter days and to show the world the brightest smile anyoneâ€™s ever seen.
every new day is a blessing. 
i believe in you, stay strongðŸ’›

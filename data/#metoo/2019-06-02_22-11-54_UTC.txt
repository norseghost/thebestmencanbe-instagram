today, I want to tell the story of the Indonesian Seventh-Day Adventist (SDA) community I grew up in.

I was born in Loma Linda, CA, one of the cities most saturated with Indonesian SDA culture. SDA K-12 schools, SDA universities, SDA churches, SDA sports teams... you name it, they got it. âš½

this mini-world was really supportive of my mother and I as we navigated the immigration system and establishing ourselves financially after the domestic violence case in my home. ðŸ’—

it was also really difficult to be a part of as someone constantly questioning and being surrounded by toxic masculinity, gender binaries, and my own queerness. ðŸŒˆ

I went through and witnessed some really difficult things in this church community, from anti-blackness to conversion therapy, from sexual assault to ridicule of single mothers, from survivor shaming to a lack of reproductive justice advocacy. ðŸ’”

my femme communities held me continuously as we learned and grew together. I want to support Indonesian communities in fighting for our basic needs and rights for years to come. will you please consider donating $75 to help me make my dreams come true? ðŸ’¸

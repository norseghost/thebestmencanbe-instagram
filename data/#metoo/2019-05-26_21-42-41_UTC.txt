Me whakamānawa ka tika! ✊ Big shout 😱 out to Miriama Kamo from Marae who won the award for Best reporting - Maori affairs at the 2019 Voyager Media Awards. Kei runga noa atu koe Miriama 💁‍♀️ Judges’ comment:
‘As #metoo dominated global headlines, Miriama Kamo brought the issue of sexual abuse home with the right balance of cultural sensitivity and objectivity. Her exclusive with Ani Black was the interview everyone stopped to watch.’

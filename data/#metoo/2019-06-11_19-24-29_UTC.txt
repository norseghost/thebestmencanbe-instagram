When I was 16...
I stood in the first room of a Hollister instead of my 2nd block class during HS for a year doing  Work Program. It got me out of school lunch and I allowed me to nearly date every one of my attractive female coworkers😁. #notsorry being a model for a Hco store consisted of steaming clothes, spraying cologne, restocking, and folding clothes... which I did none of! As one of two male "model" guys there... the only thing they required me to absolutely do was to use the tag line... which was something always ridiculous and was no way of saying it not as such... "Hey, make sure you check out how soft my fleece is!" Which would then invite wealthy middle aged housewives(shopping for their daughters, but leave w 75% own intent to wear themselves😉) to older women to touch and feel up on my arms, chest, and there about... almost always w a mischievous, incendiary, or suggestive comment before moving on to shop... This song reminds me of that! #metoo 🤣😂🤣 SIDE BAR》》 my female coworkers used to disgustingly despise the older women when they did this😆 I may have encouraged for my own amusement once or twice...

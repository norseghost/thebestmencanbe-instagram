Catcalling is a form of sexual harassment. According to the recently signed Safe Streets and Public Spaces Act, this specifies the gravity of sexual harassment including lascivious language, stalking, rubbing or touching, indecent gestures, exhibitionism and public masturbation  in streets, alleys, public places, schools, government buildings, malls, bars, restaurants, transportation terminals, public markets and public utility vehicles. Good day for everyone! Safer place for everybody! Let's continue to fight against domestic and sexual abuse! WE DESERVE TO FEEL SAFE EVERYWHERE WE GO! •

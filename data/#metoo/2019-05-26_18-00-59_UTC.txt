Ok so normally I try my best to stay away from this topic because I don’t have a fully formed opinion yet. Thing is, when I saw this, I knew it was wrong. Birth control prevents a pregnancy from even occurring. There isn’t even a fetus!!! Most birth control pills are "combination pills" containing a mix of the hormones estrogen and progesterone to prevent ovulation (the release of an egg during the monthly cycle). A woman cannot get pregnant if she doesn't ovulate because there is no egg to be fertilized. A law stopping women from being able to choose whether or not they PREVENT their pregnancy is an outrageous violation of personal health and rights. You don’t see these MEN saying we should outlaw condoms now, do you? - A Maiden Of Society

I love this book, As well this topic in general. Have been renovating the studio recently. Doing outside things in this beautiful weather. Today, I've received very bad world news. Malaysia, I have family from Malaysia on my dad's side. I've heard many horrific stories from my cousin and his wife. Not having visited yet I have little to no understanding, though I know they've been pulling people out for years. He is a social worker. The few times we've talked now that I'm old enough, the descriptions of wartorn and chaos has resonated. Today Malaysia reports all of our recycling, frances recycling, the uks recycling, potentially others. If being outsourced and not recycled on site, Is being dumped into Malaysia. My cousin does not live there, but he does work there from time to time helping others gain Australian citizenship. It's incredibly disappointing to know that is where they are not recycling, yet dumping the outsourced green movement. I do a lot of recycling, it's part of my life and housing situation. I collect so much god damn aluminum, it even has it's own room. We don't outsource often. Try to only have one bag of trash a month. To know that the plastics are being dumped in a country that's been struggling with much more than air and water is absolutely disgusting.  Don't outsource your recycling. Hear Malaysia. #freepress #metoo #blacklivesmatter #waterprotectors #climatechange #recylcing #why #letswastegascarryingitovertoo

We take care of each other. Though the rope wasn‚Äôt always this long, been frayed, cut and burned; the love unconditional, it has no need to be earned. There‚Äôs an honesty in struggle, that‚Äôs how the real ones survive; it isn‚Äôt a matter of flight or fight, it‚Äôs just another bridge to burn, another wall to climb. Another ceiling to blow, another podium to place. Only the awards given here are not called trophies, they don‚Äôt sit on a shelf; their kept inside, not shared or promoted. They‚Äôre kept quiet, in the pocket, worn on the sleeve, no need to be quoted. The real ones close the door and fight for you too, when you spat blood and wished us dead, we stood up for you, yelled over the counter, and had our rights read. We let you believe you could hate us, easier for you than to discuss what you were really living through. We know because we were once in your shoes. So we put it aside, admiring your struggle, just know that we see you, behind all your scars and your rubble. ‚ô•Ô∏èüåπ

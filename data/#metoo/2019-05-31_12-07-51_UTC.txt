“ITS SO FUNNY.. That we DON’T TALK ANYMORE...” #metoo and conversation.. THIS IS A MAJOR FAIL... 😳. From age 13 on.. we here in “West” world.. are taught that conversation between men and women is pretty much for ONE purpose .. make “it” happen..,LOCK “it” down.. (#dianaross singing “I’M GONNA MAKE YOU LOVE ME..YES..I WILL..”) It’s a “push/pull” dance perpetrated by every “hook up” song out there .. from before Elvis to NOW.. ) and that’s OK.. because SEX AS A WEAPON.. is not about THAT... it’s about CONTROL AND POWER.. ( I “do” because I can..😳). SO WHY.. are we all running around ..DAZED AND CONFUSED...about the “change of RULES”? THE RULES HAVE NOT CHANGED.. We are supposed to Pursue connections .. healthy, strong connections .. so what’s up, AMERICA?  Why is “I don’t know “how far is too far”... crap and “shutdown” we have going here?  MEN AND WOMEN.. WE ALL WANT CONNECTIONS.. Genuine.. “listen to each other”.. “collaborate and build” CONNECTIONS.. .. that comes with “intimacy”.. sometimes “of the mind”.. sometimes “of the body”.. and lucky.. if you can find BOTH..in one package ..❤️ “NO IS NO”.. ( and ummm..LADIES.. Sex is a weapon for us too.... don’t use it to “get ahead” and then whine .. ( or as I say..”Sweetie.. you CASHED THE CHECK..😳).. LETS ALL JUST “CARRY ON” OUT THERE.. LIKE THE “EVOLVED” HUMANS WE CLAIM TO BE ON SOCIAL MEDIA..#whycantwebefriends ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️#metoomovement #talkingtoeachother #nothingwrongwiththat #hypersensitive #connections #fridaymood #weekendvibes ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ 💙💙 #nyc#nycwoman#nyclife#manhattanlife#realme#whoweare#nycwriter#nycblogger#writeon#writersofinstagram#writerscommunity #mystory#mystorycontinues#lifelessons#upperwestsidenyc#centralparknyc #centralparkwest#shareyourtruth ❤️❤️

Women painters signed their canvases with an initial or altered their name in order to avoid discrimination. ✍️My son often asks why are there no women artists in museums ? 🤷🏼‍♂️Well we know that is slowly changing.  This book 📚 Independent Spirits is an amazing look at women artists painting the beauty and history of the American West.  What an inspiration! #metoo #womenpaintersrock #womenpainters #womenpainterswest #espressohit #peonies #tuesdaymotivation #nespresso #femaleartist #femaleartistsofinstagram #femaleartists .

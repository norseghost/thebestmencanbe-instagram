I am finally starting fo feel good in my own skin again. I am not there yet but working daily to get where I want to be and I get stronger in the progress too. 
Now that I am finally letting the walls around me crumble down and letting myself be the real me, I also feel like I can show what I want to show of myself. I feel more confident, more proud of who I am and what I have overcome.
For years, mainly because of my metoo expierence at 17 in the music industry and then followed by the physical struggles after my accident, I was never really comfortable with myself or to even allow myself to have a sexy side.
No more, I am not letting people or unfortunate events, taking away that side of me any longer. 
On a sidenote ðŸ–¤ I am forever obsessed with schoolgirl skirts, I can never own too many!

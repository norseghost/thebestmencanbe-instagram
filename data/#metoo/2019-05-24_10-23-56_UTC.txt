From text: Harvey Weinstein has reached a tentative $44m deal to resolve lawsuits and compensate his alleged victims of sexual misconduct, according to reports.

The deal, which has been reached with his accusers, his former film studio’s board members and the New York attorney general’s office, was reported by the Wall Street Journal and Associated Press.
...
Weinstein, who won plaudits and awards through his company and another studio, Miramax, for movies including Shakespeare in Love, Pulp Fiction and The King’s Speech, fell from grace after more than 70 women, mostly young actresses and others in the movie business, accused him of sexual misconduct dating back decades.
...
His case helped launch the #MeToo movement, which has led to dozens of powerful men in entertainment, politics and other fields being accused of sexual misconduct.

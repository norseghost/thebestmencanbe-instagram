Hi!  So this is going to be a super fast post today, because I am behind ðŸ˜¬. But luckily, this book doesn't need a lot of explanation!
ðŸ¤—
Obviously I picked up this book, because hello, the title.  But I was really impressed with how smart this book is.  It's not just yay, feminism!! It's yay, feminism...and also here's why. Here's the history. Here's what the issues are. Here's why they matter. Here are some role models and prominent feminists as examples. Plus it looks great and it's easy to read. Love it!  A great resource for teens!

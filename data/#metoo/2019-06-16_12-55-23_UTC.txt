Wishing all prominent male role models a happy Father’s Day!! To the world you are a father but to your family you are the world 🌍✨.. We need you, we want you, we love you & we support you! •
@daddyless_daughters is far from a #menaretrash movement or #metoo our vision is to bridge the gap between fathers and their daughters so we can ALL be free from being emotionally crippled.. 💕✨

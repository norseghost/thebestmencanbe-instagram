Which of these 3 writing quotes resonate with you?
Personally, all 3 ring true for me; And here’s why:
I’m at that point in my life wherein I refuse to be paralyzed by my own or other people’s judgements of my writing.  The main thing that matters to me now is being able to express myself onto paper. I write because it is healing for me.  It clears away the wreckage of my thoughts and the chaos of my emotions. For that, I will keep on writing.  And with all due respect, I will not apologize for writing my truth ♥️

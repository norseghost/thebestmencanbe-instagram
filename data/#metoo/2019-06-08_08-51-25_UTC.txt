A title: "The feels of love."
.
An author: T Kira Madden (@tkmadden)
.
A paragraph: "He holds your hand as you walk out the exit, over to the covered parking lot. Nobody has ever held your hand before, not in this way, and it feels damp, uncomfortable. You feel self-conscious that he will see your fingers in the daylight—the raisin-sized open wounds around your nails where you gnaw the skin off, where you cut with safety pins at night. You always carry yourself with fists for this reason, your thumbs tucked in. Sometimes, when it’s worse, you wrap each fingertip in bandages for school. Your mother says you look like a serial killer that way, and this only makes you do it more."
.
A reason: because the way the author experiments with past and present is thrilling, it will keep you  on the edge of your seat until the very end. Also, the nineties references are lovely (all of this in addition to how crude but skillfully told the story is).

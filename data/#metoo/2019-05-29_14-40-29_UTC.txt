This is the face of a woman who has gotten her spark back. 
No one gave it to me.  It was always there,  buried by pain. 
Now I am working through that pain.  It no longer owns me. 
I am not just my trauma. 
I am #proud. I am #strong.  I am intelligent.  I am a #warrior.  I am the woman who moved mountains. 
I will never break. 
Ever. 
This is a woman on fire. 
The world is mine.  The universe provides. 
#Believe in yourself... Don't look away,  show them your fire.

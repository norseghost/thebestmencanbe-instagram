The ShaktiMat ‘Gratitude Factory’ was founded in 2006. Through our work there, we have been focused on Female Empowerment in India for 12 years.

Before the rise of #metoo and #timesup and the womens' marches in America - all movements that we are excited about 🎉

Here’s a quick rundown of all that we do to support our crafts-women:

We create a ‘female-only’ safe space, by only employing women 🌵

There are currently 76 crafts-women and we hope to bring more 🌵

We pay more than twice the going rate for their work 🌵

They receive holiday pay, sickness pay, and paid religious & community days off 🌵

They get free meals and free healthcare for themselves and their families 🌵

They have access to an emergency medical fund, covering themselves and their wider family from accident and illness 🌵

We have sent 9 girls from the poorest families to private school until they reach 18, and we aim to grow this number 🌵

The opportunity for women in India to be self-sufficient and financially independent is a rare thing.
We are proud to now be in our 12th year of supporting these women’s lives 🌵

This is a post by ‘cheruib’, saying: “It’s okay to change. It’s okay to discover new things and indulge in them, it doesn’t mean that You’re not true to yourself or that You lied about your old interests, don’t be afraid to change and let go of the things You’ve been holding onto for so long.” End image description.

I have a gift for the women out there in a healing journey around their sexuality.... We have all seen about women claiming their voice from the #Metoo movement.

BUT - so many women became retraumatized because they did not have the tools and safe spaces that will allow them to fully heal their body and say goodbye to the past.

It's time to cut the B.S.- and invite pleasure, the right application of neuroscience, and a profound sense of belonging {hello sacred sisterhood} into this space.

And that is why I am so excited to share with you something that my close friend @dagmarkhan,  is doing.

I am beyond excited to invite you into her FREE Trauma Breakthrough Immersion experience, June 18th-20th.

Here's what she'll be sharing with you: - DAY 1: FROM TRAUMA TO PLEASURE [the secret blueprint that will help you heal from the grips of trauma and reclaim your pleasure].
- DAY 2: BODY SAFETY CODE [how Dagmar’s client saved €75,000 on unnecessary treatments and reclaimed safety in her body- and you can do the same].
- DAY 3: SEX AFTER TRAUMA [Sex after trauma means feeling safe around intimacy and learning how to trust and feel turned on at the same time].
In this incredible 3-day live experience, you will be given the step-by-step roadmap for releasing trauma from your body, so you can feel alive in every area of your life.

You won't regret taking this opportunity.

I’m still not asking for it #metoo
What? I’m in a bralette  style top and I’m not asking for your perverted and unwanted attention. Shocker. 
Apologies to my family who have the joy of reading this post and to the young girls on my insta - You can stop reading here. 
This one goes out to select few of my guy friends that have chosen to support rape culture through direct action or inaction. 
I was naive enough to think that it wouldn’t happen to me. That I wouldn’t be sexually assaulted or harassed. Spoiler alert. It’s happened twice. When reality is I can count the number of women I know that haven’t been on one hand. And you stand there and tell me because you don’t do that you’re not part of the problem. Well here’s a reality check. 
To my close guy friend, I told you about what happened to me. I opened up and I cried. You sent back a pizza recipe and a “hey, I don’t want that kind imagery”. Thank you. That really helped. 
To the guys I told about their friend trying to abuse me, all you had to say was “oh you have to remember how he was brought up.” “You should reconsider what guys you for”. You made excuse after excuse for why my story was invalid. 
Thank you. That really helped. 
To the guys who’ve abused me over social media because “you look like the kind of girl that puts out, why don’t you put out for me”. When I ask what makes you think this is okay and you respond with “well I’m not physically touching you so it’s not harassment. What are you going to do?” I’m lucky enough that I haven’t let my experiences break me, that they no longer hurt me, that they don’t define me. But if you’re one of my guy friends, can you do me a favour? Can you stop supporting this kind of culture. I know it’s not “all men”.

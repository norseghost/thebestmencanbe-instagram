CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE & GENDER IDENTITY....🧐 Nobody really talks🗣 about this but being sexually abused as a child can obviously be detrimental to our identity but what about our gender identity?🤷🏻‍♀️ For me, it was the first and most obvious sign of the abuse but I was so young that my parents thought that it was just a normal part of my personality👶🏻 I refused to put on a dress👗 as soon as I was able to object✋. I despised being a girl🤮, I saw it as a weakness & felt vulnerable😔. At some point, I actually thought I was a boy. My mother had to call me Peter when calling me in for dinner from the park because I had told everyone that was my name😅

As I grew, it did become problematic😥People would ask me if I was a boy or a girl as they laughed at me. The boys I crushed on never liked me back & saw me as one of the guys. I wished I could be like the girls they admired...I felt fundamentally flawed😫. I wished I was normal & could fit in, but I couldn’t🥺

Until this day, you won’t catch me with a dress on & Im still very Tomboyish. But today, I’m proud of who I am😀 & if someone doesn’t love me the way I am, they can go...you know where😏

I know I’m not the only survivor effected by the abuse in this way, there are many of us. It’s a normal reaction to what has happened to us & we should never be ashamed of it. I accept myself the way I am✊...& so should you👌

Know that you are beautiful just the way you are❤️

Accepting my traumas came with ease. 
Letting them go is much harder... or maybe not at all. 
I want memory of the past, so that I can empathize with and help others. 
So I can appreciate those who fight to get to a good position in life. 
So I can look up to those who went through worse, and were able to defy the statistics. 
and most importantly... so I can appreciate the little things knowing that I am safe, loved, and free. 
If that means occasionally scratching a few wounds to remind myself how lucky I am - so be it. .

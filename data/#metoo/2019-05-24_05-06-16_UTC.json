                        "text": "For years, Americans have shrugged their shoulders over NSA surveillance and government access to digital data and said, \u201cI don\u2019t care; I have nothing to hide.\u201d Now they are starting to see that maybe they do have something to hide. They are starting to understand that their own preferences and those of their friends and family can be hoovered up and stored in perpetuity and fed through algorithms to produce manipulative messaging intended to move beliefs and influence actions.\n\nAlthough regulators and state attorneys general are launching investigations, the real hammer will be the market. Whether it is Facebook, Twitter, or some other social media platform, when users start to realize that the data they are sharing may be used against them or cause them to lose control over their beliefs or be manipulated, they will begin to shut off. If the company can\u2019t be trusted with personal data, users simply will not use that platform and advertisers will go elsewhere.\n\nRoger McNamee, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s long-time mentor, saw the risk early on and tried to get Facebook executives to manage it, but his warnings fell on deaf ears.  In an interview with Christiane Amanpour, McNamee said that in October 2016, he personally warned Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg of the magnitude of the risk, but failed to get their attention. According to McNamee, Facebook\u2019s leaders kept arguing that Facebook is a platform company, not a media company and \u201cwe\u2019re not responsible for what third parties do.\u201d McNamee warned them then, - You have 1.7 billion members and if they decide you are responsible, it won\u2019t matter what the law says.\n\nJody Westby\nForbes\n\n#marketing #trending #profit #political #success #collective #ootd #politics #trending #metoo #timesup #trend #strategy #feminism #finnishgirl #freedom #graphics #future #lifestyle #journalist #journalism #psychology #god #fashion #trendy #hygge #blogger #influencer #business #lgbt #concept"

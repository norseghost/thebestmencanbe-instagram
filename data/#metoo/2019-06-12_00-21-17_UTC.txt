Throw out the lies for the truth.
"I am His."
"My future is secure in Him."
"I am adored."
"I am forgiven."
"I am fully known yet fully loved by Him."
"Thank You, Lord, for making me holy and pure."
"God, You chose me and created me with purpose. Thank You for setting me apart from the world."

Practice telling yourself these things every day throughout the day and watch how your life will begin to be transformed from the inside out. God bless! 😘🥰🤗🙏🏽

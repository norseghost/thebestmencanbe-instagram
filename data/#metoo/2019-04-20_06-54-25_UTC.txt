I'm not sure what to say about this. It's not the best and I wrote it a while ago but it holds a lot of energy for me. It's one of the first things I wrote that got me back into writing and I tried to add a lot of emotion. I was going through something rough and I've found that since I started writing again I've been doing better. Well that's all folks ✌🏻️👌🏻 #MeToo #Poetry #Writing #MentalHealth

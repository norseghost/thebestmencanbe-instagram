@kidlitexchange #partner “Thanks to the @kidlitexchange network for the review copy of this book - all opinions are my own.” WOW! I started reading SHOUT, Laurie Halse Anderson's memoir, this afternoon, and was hooked from the start...finished it a few hours later! What a powerful read! Written in verse, her words spew from the page-part horrific, part extraordinary, part vitriolic, and part admirable. Her ability to address the topic of rape unapologetically speaks to the need for this type of discussion given her own experience of being raped when she was 13. As a teen, she tries to maneuver living with her suicidal alcoholic father whose WWII experiences inflict trauma for her family while watching her mother silently live through the horror of his outbursts. While Part I centers on this part of her story, Parts II and III SHOUT out about the issues of sexual abuse, survivors, harassment, the #MeToo movement, and society's treatment of women. Anderson brings hope to those who find their voices through her writing, especially those who have been victimized and struggle with their own self worth. “Too many grown-ups tell kids to follow their dreams / like that’s going to get them somewhere / Auntie Laurie says follow your nightmares instead / cuz when you figure out what’s eating you / you can slay it." A poignant YA read that would be especially helpful to someone who has experienced sexual abuse or harassment. I would also recommend it to parents of teens as it would open the door to discussions of consent and societal norms including harassment of both girls and boys.

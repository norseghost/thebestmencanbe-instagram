The BNB Netball group had a charity event for their annual Mixed Netball Tournament.
WARIF was the chosen charity and we are pictured above with the winning team holding our “No Tolerance” T-shirt.
WARIF was represented by our in-house Doctor, Dr Anie Makanjuola and our Project Officer, Miss Grace Ioryue.

Iâ€™ve been struggling with this page the past couple of weeks. When I started this process, mission if you will, I didnâ€™t realize how emotional it would be or how difficult it would be. Even though I havenâ€™t really shared any sort of identifying information yet ( I will eventually) it is an incredibly vulnerable to put any of this information out for the world to potentially see. It has caused a myriad of emotions and Iâ€™m sure there are more to come. 
So today I wanted to share a woman who has inspired me recently with her bravery. She lost her brother to suicide and has opened her wounds repeatedly to help others have a safe space to heal. Her art is beautiful and I am thankful to have found @facesoffortitude. Suicide has touched my life as well as incest along with many other experiences I promise to share as I shed the shame and fear of exposing more. Itâ€™s a process and thankful to have you all along for the journey ðŸ’›

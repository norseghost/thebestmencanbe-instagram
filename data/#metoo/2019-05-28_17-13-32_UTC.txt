Family planning. 
Men- you are half of the family.
We need you to stand up for YOUR future also. 
CHILD CARE, Birth control, condoms, plan B, tubal ligation, vasectomies, and abortionâ€™s all need to be within EVERYBODYS reach. 
The fastest way to stop a society from advancing is by taking away family planning. We are too educated, Worldly, we want more experiences and opportunities. We want less kids. 
Men will go back to working 2 jobs just to feed their huge family. 
Women will need to stay home to cook, clean and maintain the household. 
AMERICANS DESERVE THE AMERICAN DREAM, To be who and what you want.  Family planning is a corner stone as part of the plan.  This is supposed to be the land of the free, Filled with hope and compassion. 
Christians, Muslims, buddhists, anarchist, protestants, catholics, Hindis, Jewish, white, black, blind, Asian, in a wheel chair, people who like dogs or cats... EVERYONE DEPENDS ON FAMILY PLANNING IN SOME WAY.

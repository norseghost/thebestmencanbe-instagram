✨ EXCITING NEWS ✨

We just made our SECOND donation!!! This time we donated $100 to @aclu_nationwide, $100 to @plannedparenthood plus an additional $60 to celebrate @mike.pence’s 60th birthday today! You can head to our Instagram Story highlight entitled “donations” for more transparency on our donations. ✨

In honor of #PrideMonth, we also donated $100 to @victoryfund and created this “hi i’m bi” tee which you can shop on our bio! We decided to create this tee because often those who identify as bisexual feel isolated and ostracized within the community and in society as a whole. To stand in solidarity with our bi friends and followers, we wanted to create a tee that would show support and fight against bi erasure. 100% of proceeds from this shirt will go towards @victoryfund helping LGBTQ+ identifying people running for office!!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜

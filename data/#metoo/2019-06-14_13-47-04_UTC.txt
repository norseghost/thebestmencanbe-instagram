My scimom journey began during my PhD when I got pregnant with twins. I gave birth by emergency C-section the day after my PhD defence was scheduled. I still took papers to hospital to prepare for the defence, and only cancelled it when the doctor said a premature birth was eminent (waters broke the next day). After a postdoc and a new baby, I embarked on a new career in science editing/writing.
.
I'm a single mom-of-4 now, but I began feeling the challenges of being a scimom already during pregnancy. My twin pregnancy was very tough physically and emotionally. Besides being exhausted, I had to stop working early in the pregnancy due to risk of premature labour. So although everyone in my lab was very supportive, I didn’t have time to finish my experiments and never got to publish my main PhD paper.
.
But it wasn’t just biology. At work it seemed people assumed I was no longer ambitious. From subtle comments to being pushed to 3rd author because my colleague needed a publication... But why not me? And obviously I should get fair recognition for my work.
.
After having kids, it was as though I had been pushed outside the imaginary circle of people with outstanding academic potential, downgraded to the second league. I was working 10x harder to prove myself and show my ambition, but for some people my work seemed invisible, taken for granted.
.
I always thought I was the problem, but when I started connecting with other moms I realised many had lived similar experiences.
.
There have been many truly supportive people along the way, but feeling left out affected my self-confidence at the time. This isn’t why I decided to leave academia, but for some women it might be.
.
Mothers (but not fathers) have to be superheroes and push themselves physically and emotionally to stay in the game and it shouldn’t be this way.
.
The aim of @mothersinscience is to raise awareness of these issues and create a support network for moms in science. We hope to empower working mothers and encourage them to pursue their career ambitions and fulfil their true potential.

‪Rising out of the ashes and into the light! Stepping out in faith and trust in Christ alone. Stepping out for the #abused #rejected #silenced #abandoned #voiceless women out there. #metoo #churchtoo 
Praying that God would use this to set many captives free and give many women a platform to speak and help each other heal as we look to Christ. ❤️🙏 Isaiah 61:1-3

Your prayers are appreciated! 🙏 ‪ “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD has anointed me To bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to captives And freedom to prisoners; To proclaim the favorable year of the LORD And the day of vengeance of our God; To comfort all who mourn, To grant those who mourn in Zion, Giving them a garland instead of ashes, The oil of gladness instead of mourning, The mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting. So they will be called oaks of righteousness, The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.”
‭‭ISAIAH‬ ‭61:1-3‬ ‭NASB‬‬

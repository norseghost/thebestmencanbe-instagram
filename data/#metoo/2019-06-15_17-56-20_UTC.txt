I came to the end of myself...I was 16 and I’d already been through enough for a dozen lifetimes and I wanted to end it all. ⠀
⠀
As I’m writing my book The Girl In The Garage, I struggled with whether I should share that I’d sunk that low or not. I cried as I wrote about my naive attempt at suicide. I thought about my kids hearing the details of my life and wondered what they’d think of me now? ⠀
⠀
And then I thought about 16 year old me....what did she need to hear? Maybe you’re 16 or 16 year old you needs to know you matter and what has been done to you is NOT who you are? ⠀
⠀
⠀
Maybe you’ve had that moment when you’ve had it - had enough and you know you can’t fix it....you’ve run out of ideas, money, or hope. That’s the moment you need to run to Jesus and you need to find people to walk with you as you heal. ⠀
⠀⠀
He’s just waiting for us to get over our “I’m fine, I got this, I don’t need any help” attitude. I know, remember?! ⠀
⠀
He doesn’t push his way in...he’s given us a free will and many of us are pretty strong willed.(I was)⠀
⠀⠀
It’s ok to not know all the answers....the truth is we really don’t, even though at times we think we do. ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
4 words will change everything- Jesus, I need you. ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
That’s it, it’s that simple. He promises he will never leave you or forsake you. ⠀⠀
⠀
Be still and know, it will work out - that’s what my 16 year old self also needed to know. DM if I can help you. Sometimes just knowing you’re seen and heard can change your life. ⠀

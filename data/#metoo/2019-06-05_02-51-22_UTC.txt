Back in January, on the first new moon of the year, after my psychiatrist appointment, and this is the bullshit I had to deal with. 
The last time I tried to talk to my ex was at least 5 years ago (I know this because I had messaged him not too long after our breakup to let him know my father had been diagnosed with stage 3 esophageal cancer - to which he did not reply - and as of last month my father has been cancer free for 5 years). Occasionally I would run into him downtown or he would be around because of mutual friends and I would try to be as pleasant as possible to the person who warped my being but ultimately changed it for the better (AKA ignore him). And then this. This is what I receive. 
A notification that he began following me, and would like to send me a message. 
He no longer followed me after our messages. 
I took a while to really think after my üëç reply. This was going to be the last time I was ever going to have to engage with this asshole; how can I condense 7~ years of trauma and pain and reflection and emotion? As nicely as I could because I‚Äôm too fucking nice. 
Well, not anymore ü•Ä

It\u2019s coming up on the 3 year mark since my world was changed forever.  3 years since someone I trusted and cared for deeply took a huge piece of me and destroyed it. He almost cost me my life without hesitation, thought or remorse.  Do I hate him? No.  Do I keep up with him? No.  I\u2019ve left behind anyplace and everyone that associates with him.  Even though I\u2019ve moved on, returned to a happy state of being, found peace and healed, the scars remain.  I won\u2019t go to the town he works in because the idea of running into him makes me physically sick (he\u2019s a firefighter ) and it\u2019s hard because my kids go to school there.  I\u2019ve lost friends, I\u2019ve lost opportunities and for a while I lost my faith.  I no longer trust easily or freely and I still have nightmares.  I left a field I loved (training-gym) partly because that is where I met him and the atmosphere was ruined for me because everyone became capable of the same thing. \ud83d\ude22  Some have said don\u2019t let it get to you and get... well, shitty because they just don\u2019t UNDERSTAND.  It\u2019s just not that easy.  I don\u2019t share this for sympathy or out of anger or even to call out the man that has faced NO consequences but more to try and show that the aftermath of abuse and trauma don\u2019t just go away.  They stay with us, influence us, haunt us and for some - reshape us.  Just because people seem to change (abuser and victim) it doesn\u2019t mean what happened is \u201cover\u201d or \u201cin the past\u201d, it just means that the rest of the world can no longer see it.  Every year I travel the week before the \u201canniversary\u201d; but not to hide.  I leave as a reminder that I survived and that I am blessed to have the life I have and that I should never take it for granted again.  #survivor #metoo #emotionalabuse #mentalabuse #heal #healthy #protectyourself #itsokaynottobeokay #mentalhealthawareness #ptsd #veteran #noshame #nevergiveup #keepfighting #family #scars"

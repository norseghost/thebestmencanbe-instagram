I was talking about the #metoo movement with a close friend of mine and a lot of things came up. This is an old picture of me sharing the story of Draupadi. From the time of the Mahabharata, there was conversation about the wrongness of standing by when there is abuse. Sadly, the same goes on in conversation. I see abuse and perversity all around me. And I’m deeply affected by this state of being. I know that movements like #metoo bring about an awareness, and an awakening to the situation around us. But I think it is important that every single person irrespective of gender helps empower somebody around them. That every single person teaches children to be kind and teaches them to respect and love another human being. The change hasn’t happened yet. We are just aware now.... that’s all. And not even everyone is aware. Some people are aware.....I know I need to do more. I don’t know what yet. But I will be doing something in the months to come. There needs to be change in how we grow up as #humans .... Photo: Vinita

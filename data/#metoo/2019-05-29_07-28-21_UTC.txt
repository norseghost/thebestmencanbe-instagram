5 Things Women Can Do to Empower Other Women
#1. Tell your story
Tell your story, share your wins but share your losses and mistakes too. Other women can learn from you. It will inspire them to believe they have the power to reach their goals too. 
#2. Stand up for women
When you see discrimination, unacceptable behaviour or an unequal playing field, call it out. Report it. Don’t worry about developing a reputation for rocking the boat. It is something to be proud of. 
#3. Share opportunities
We need to work together to promote ourselves. Look for and recommend women who would benefit from an upcoming opportunity and recommend them. Collaborate with other women. Keep in mind women who are further marginalised and disadvantaged.
#4. Encourage other women
Encourage women to put up their hands for new opportunities, to apply for promotions, to ask for training, to seek mentors and be mentors. Hold other women’s hands, encourage them, give them a push when they it, and keep reminding them of their talents and abilities. There are a lot of people who find it easy to pull others down. We need to be the people to help them climb.
#5. Build your network
Look for women who are positive, encouraging, strong and determined to help other women succeed. There’s strength in numbers, especially emotional strength which you’ll need at some stage to help you keep standing up for yourself and other women. Build a strong network both at work and outside and stay in touch. 
We need each other. The more we work together and support each other, the more we’ll be heard. Your age, your role, your experience – none of it matters.
You can start empowering other women right now. Don’t let anything hold you back. You are needed.

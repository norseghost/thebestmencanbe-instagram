💎So I just finished a session with yet another of my amazing coaching clients and I could have talked ALL DAY LONG about tapping into your intuition. 💎

Seriously, guys, “Tapping Into Your Intuition” is my very favorite week in my coaching program... and my clients agree. 
The brain and the sub-conscious mind are soooo fascinating. 🧠 I love teaching about the science behind intuition,🤓 the connection to energy, 💫and the practical tools 🔨 to strengthen your intuition… we go deep and that stuff works. 💥

Intuition is the basis of everything I teach from stepping into the life of your dreams after abuse, to launching your survivor advocacy mission. 💪💪💪 I’m going to be reopening my coaching applications form in a few weeks and introducing a group coaching option as well. 👩‍👧‍👧 If you want details on how to get on the waiting list to be the first to hear about it comment with an emoji and I’ll message you with the info. ⬇️⬇️⬇️ #lifecoach #metoo #churchtoo #healing #intuition #trustyourgut #trustyourintuition #spiritualawakening #happiness #lifechanging #spirtualscience

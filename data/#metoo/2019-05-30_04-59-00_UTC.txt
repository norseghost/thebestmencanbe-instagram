❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌TW TW TW TW❌❌❌❌❌❌❌ You were more like a brother to me than a cousin. 
You were only two years older than me but I looked up to you and trusted you. 
But you weren’t trustworthy and you used my innocence and my trusting nature against me. 
You used me for your own selfish perversion. 
For years you used me. 
Knowing I would keep silent because I didn’t have anyone in my life to trust with the truth. 
Certainly not my parents. 
No, they weren’t trustworthy either. 
So I kept silent and you exploited it. 
And now I’m the one sobbing my eyes out in therapy. 
Screaming myself awake from hellish nightmares. 
Anxiety so bad I can barely breathe. 
A cloud of shame that strangles me everywhere I go. 
You should be the one carrying it. 
You should be the one sobbing in therapy over the evils you did to me. 
But you’re not. 
You’re living your life as if it never happened. 
But it did. 
And I have carried that burden, that horror, for years. 
But no longer. 
You can’t hurt me anymore. 
The evil you put me through has tested my very soul. 
But I have found my strength! (Cont in comments)——-Emily

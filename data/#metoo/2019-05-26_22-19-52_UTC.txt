I dont know where to begin with this post, firstly the tickets were a complete surprise from my finance(im still shocked!). Now to describe the show in a world where the #metoo movement is at an all time high, its truly great to see a man take to the stage and, not only make it his own, but also share it for all those around him. The show celebrates women, men,  all nationalities and sexuality while all being family friendly and artistic while still telling the story of his life. To see how he intracts not only with his fans but also with the dancers and musicians and crew, to his family, and his love for his wife is inspiring @thehughjackman you have the making of an idol and it was an absolute pleasure to watch you shine. #themanthemusictheshow #hughjackman #lifeststartsat30 #thankyoufuturewifey #loveislove

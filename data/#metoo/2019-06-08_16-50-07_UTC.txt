SHARAYAH.  We asked, what is a lie that Satan loves to tell you.  A lie that you hear over and over in your mind?  Second, what is Gods truth over it?
.
"The lie that Satan tries to tell me most is that I need to be ashamed of my sin and hide it or fight it alone, and that if people truly knew the things I’ve been through or done, they wouldn’t want to have anything to do with me. But the truth is that there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ (Romans 8:1) and there is so much freedom and healing that comes through confession of our sins to others after we’ve confessed to our heavenly Father. When I’ve been vulnerable with people in my life about my sin, I’ve seen Jesus in the way they responded to me with mercy and kindness and grace. I’ve seen relief when a friends say “I’ve been dealing with this too” and they finally have a safe places to work that out and have someone to battle along side them. I’ve learned and am still learning to be vulnerable and remove the mask of “perfect Christian” because that’s really unrealistic and toxic and keeps me from living in the fullness of Gods plans for my life. I am no longer a slave to sin, there is no condemnation!."

Thank you for sharing courageously + vulnerably sister!

I want to encourage you today to challenge the words in your mind against the truth of what God says and then proclaim that truth. Loudly, Boldly, Confidently.  You are a warrior sister!

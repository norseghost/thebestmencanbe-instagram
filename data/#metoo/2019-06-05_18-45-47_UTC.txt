ive never thought about this. one time i wondered why womensâ€™ swimming costumes were so revealing because i wanted to swim but couldnâ€™t because of the scars on my arms and legs. i still have that now, and because there arenâ€™t any long sleeved/short-type swimming costume options, i havenâ€™t been swimming in years.

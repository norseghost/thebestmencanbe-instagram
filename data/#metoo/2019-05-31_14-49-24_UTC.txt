i am so so so so very proud of this. a very very sad side effect of praising speaking up (especially in the era of #metoo ) is that we can end up shaming those survivors (of any trauma) who choose for whatever reason (saftey, job security, personality) to not speak up or publicly or in detail. it happens in art circles too--praise for art about trauma can push artists to make art about their trauma before they're ready / when they don't want to / because they think that's what art is supposed to be about. as someone who did and does not really want to "talk about it," all of these factors weighed on me so heavily I started to feel shame about shame. so i made this poem. it started with seeing my silence as a cool chick who was my friend and would beat people up for me. then my amazing gay ass rustbelt team helped me fine tune it. sometimes i hope to see my work on @buttonpoetry because i love them and it's fun and always such an honor and yes i think I'm p good at poems. but this piece, when i saw it yesterday, it was different. making and performing this poem, for me, was solid ground. it reminded me that i get to choose how to use my voice and my platform. it reminded me why people say this work is necessary. this poem feels necessary. it is necessary.  i made this poem because i needed it. i made this poem because i know im not the only one who needed it. thank you, button, for helping me hug as many scared kids as I can. thank you for helping me forgive the scared kid in me. i hope this piece finds you well. i love you.

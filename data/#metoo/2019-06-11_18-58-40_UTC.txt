Ever cut your workout short cuz you're unsure if the other person in the gym is a serial killer? I don't want to be doing some lat pull-downs and suddenly find myself in a fight to the death. I'm just minding my own business, resting between sets of T-Bar rows when this bro walks up, takes plates l was clearly using, then enters one of the nearby bathrooms. He then exits 5-ish minutes later in a state of undress, precedes to walk into the OTHER bathroom half naked, exits 30 seconds later and returns to the first bathroom, still half naked. This wasn't a locker room. He was visible to the entire gym area. Not to mention, he had approached the drinking fountain outside the bathroom several times leading up to this event, and was eyeing me pretty hard. I initially assumed he was just looking at my tattoos. Maybe wanted to ask me a question? But after the bathroom thing, I cut my workout short and bounced. Don't want to black out and wake up in someone's basement well with lotion being lowered to me in a basket. Feel me?

ðŸ’Ž Such an honor to be published in Pointed Circle's 35th issue, and so lovely to have heard all the readers this evening. This is my poem, "Rooster." In 2017, the Year of the Rooster in the Lunar Calendar, the year of Trump's inauguration, I danced so hard. Butoh was all I wanted to do on stage. I created some meaningful pieces with my body. And this is what I created with my hands ðŸ–¤

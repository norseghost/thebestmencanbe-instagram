I get messages often about how happy I look and how happy people are for me living my best life. It’s hard for me to think that this life I’m living, is the best. I deal with depression, anxiety, low self esteem, and suicidal thoughts daily. Waking up is hard, getting out of bed is hard, cleaning my apartment is hard, staying alive is hard. But I’m doing my best not to let these things defeat me. I hate when people tell me to “look at the sunsets” or “go for a walk!” Those things aren’t going to make my depression go away. What actually helps is knowing that nobody owns me, I am my own person. My name is on my lease, it belongs to me. I don’t have to let other people affect my life. I can choose who I want to be. I can’t choose that I have mental illness, but I can choose to spend time resonating in the thoughts that lift me up, not bring me down.

Former Australian Prime Minister @juliagillard told me a great story about how when she was PM, a little boy told his mum he couldn’t ever have that job because he wasn’t female. We also talked #MeToo, what went wrong for Bill Shorten and the ALP in the federal election ... and whether there’d ever be a Gillard political comeback (spoiler alert - NO)

ðŸ˜± CUBA IN CUFFS: @CubaGoodingJr turns himself into police after a woman claims he groped her in a Manhattan Hotspot.

A second woman filed a report with police Monday alleging that Gooding Jr. grabbed her butt inside of a Manhattan club more than 10 years ago.

Cuba Gooding Jr. was charged with forcible touching, a misdemeanor, in New York City on Thursday as a second woman has come forward accusing the actor of groping her more than 10 years ago.

Gooding Jr., 51, turned himself in toÂ authorities after a first woman filed a police reportÂ claiming she was at the Magic Hour Rooftop Bar and Lounge near Times Square on Sunday night when Gooding Jr. allegedly touched her breasts.

The Oscar-winning actor appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court on Thursday in handcuffs. His lawyer, Mark Heller, entered a plea on his behalf of not guilty to two charges, including forcible touching and sex abuse in the third degree. Gooding Jr. was then released on his own recognizance. Repost @abc7la #metoo #TimesUp

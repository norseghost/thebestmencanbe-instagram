Rape Culture Ends With Me! I Will Not Be Silenced! I Will Not Be Shamed!  We need to end this shamming! Enough blaming the people who were raped. You have no idea what they had to endure. You don’t know how traumatic it was. You don’t know how many people it was! Stop Blaming Rape Victims!!!! If You Blame The Victim Then You Stand With The Perpetrator!  #RapeCultureEndsWithMe #StopRape #TeachYourKidsNotToRape #HaveThoseHardTalks #StopSayingStupidStuff #RapeIsntAJoke #WeSurvived #ISurvived #EveryDayIsABattle #GetUpAndFight #IBelieveYou #MeToo

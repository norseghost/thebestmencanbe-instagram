We know Mental Health Month has passed however in the LGBTQ community, especially LGBTQ people of color, we struggle with Trauma, Abuse, and Addiction on a deeper level which generally goes unaddressed.  I know this is a triggering subject for some and I hope you see this as an opportunity to not feel alone and heal.

How does Trauma, Abuse and/or Addiction show up in your life?  How are you healing and what advice can you give?

Let's heal our #DarkAges together and rise from anything that keeps us from living our purpose.

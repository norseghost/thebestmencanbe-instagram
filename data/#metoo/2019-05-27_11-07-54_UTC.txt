What an extraordinary weekend! So grateful to the fans, the performers, and the organizers for putting on such a life-affirming and epic show! Thank you to all who came by to share their stories; I am beyond touched by your bravery, by your resilance, and by your hope. I am a better artist and person for having met all of you! @absfest

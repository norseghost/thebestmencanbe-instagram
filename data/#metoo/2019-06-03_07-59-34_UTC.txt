Such an empowering sentence. Every now and then you come across a few words placed perfectly together that change your entire life.
*
These words I took to heart when recovering from my child abuse. *
People think it's the abuser you're looking to forgive, because they don't understand the blame you place on yourself.
*
Why didn't I do better? Why didn't I tell someone? Why didn't I scream or fight back? Why didn't I leave?
*
All these questions point to one thing only - the abused is accusing themselves of being responsible for what happened to them.
*
I know I felt like it was my fault, and that altered the course of my life for many years.
*
Learning that I did the best I could, AND that my abuse wasn't about me but my abuser, changed my very existence.
*
If these words can help even one person, then they are worth writing. You are your very best self in each and every moment. The next moment you will know more than you did in the last. ❤️

So I did a shoot the day before my surgery #facialfeminizationsurgery ðŸ“¸ @photosbyswati  #metoo â€“ Healing our hearts â€“ unfastening trauma to bring hope, trust and equality:
Abuse has been prevalent for long, irrespective of gender, race, color â€“ that is what this image is trying to portray. The lips or the lack of it signify progression from silenced trauma to being relatively more vocal about abuse, to clasping new hope of an equal world. Abuse of any kind, including sexual abuse, involves power play where the perpetrator asserts supremacy and dominance through subjugation of the victim â€“ with the confidence of escaping penalization. If children are alerted and schooled about love, respect, tolerance and equality, can we hope for a society free from sexual abuse? #picoftheday

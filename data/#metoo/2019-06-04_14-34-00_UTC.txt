#KuToo: we are with you! Japanese women are fighting back against the mandatory use of high heels in the workplace, a sexist policy that force some women to endure blisters and back pain caused by the shoes. #KuToo plays on the Japanese words for shoes "kutsu" and pain "kutsuu", and also references the #MeToo movement. Around 19 000 people have signed a petition calling for Japan to end dress codes that require women to wear high heels in the workplace. At Josefinas we believe women can be their best version in flats ðŸ’ª No high-heels needed! #ProudToBeAWoman #josefinasportugal

I am a survivor, a pug mama and a good vibes spreading kinda gal.\n\u2022\nPeople tell me, \u201coh, I see you\u2019re into fitness too!\u201d Yes. And no. I\u2019m into growth. Into losing myself, finding myself, and rediscovering myself. Over and over and over.\n\u2022\nWhen I was in middle school, I was molested by a kid older than me. When I was 15, two months before my sweet 16, my family\u2019s home burnt to the ground and we lost every material possession we had. I left a domestic abuse situation, I survived a pretty rough car accident and I am alive when someone assaulted me then made the decision for me that my life was no longer worth living. I have struggled with food, alcohol, self love, self worth and even life itself.\n\u2022\nAm I into fitness? That\u2019s a strong \u201cyes.\u201d But I\u2019m also into holistic health and healing, I\u2019m into spreading awareness, I\u2019m into mental health and I\u2019m into positivity. I\u2019m into supporting women, I\u2019m into lifting heaving things and I\u2019m into living my very best life. Every. Single. Day. I am healthy. I am happy. I\u2019m just glad to be here.\n\u2022\nI didn\u2019t start an Instagram account for followers. I started Instagram for a community. A community of warriors. A community of people who lift each other up, who understand that we are each on our own unique journey, and who want to support one another with love and kindness.\n\u2022\nI want a community of people who have been through some shit. People who have gone down some dark roads but managed to survive and tell their story. I\u2019m here to tell my story. Through pictures, through writing and through gym routines. Most selfishly, I\u2019m here for me. I\u2019m here to track my journey and my progress. I\u2019m really hoping to meet some badass babes along the way.\n\u2022 \nI\u2019m not overly creative. You most likely won\u2019t see anything fancy here. What you will see? Me. The good days. The bad days. And the everything in between days. Here you\u2019ll most likely see some gardening, some KiKi the pug, some workouts and a whole lot of me.\n\u2022\nLet\u2019s be friends. Let\u2019s chat. Let\u2019s support one another. Life is about so much more than just surviving.\n\u2022\nWelcome to #mybeautifulmess"

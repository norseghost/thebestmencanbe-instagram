Yay flower arches! 🌷 But did you know that a court just ruled that Caster Semenya, South African Olympic runner, must now take medication to suppress her NATURAL levels of testosterone in order to continue competing. 🏃‍♀️🏅🏆♀️ 3 things:
1) Michael Phelps, everyone's favourite wonder boy, is meanwhile celebrated for his genetic gifts of producing half the lactic acid, his disproportionate wingspan and double jointed quality.
2) Testosterone is not a "male hormone", nor do the studies establish a clear relationship between its levels and athletic performance.
3) Suppressing your natural hormone levels has side effects that the deciding sports committee does not even have information on.

#JessieReyez was the only new artist I cared to see this past wknd. She's just 🔥! She shared a story in which she met a producer some years ago hoping to catch her big break. She performed songs for him and at the end he said, "You can sing and you've got the look, but don't you know you'll have to suck my dick to be a star?" This dialogue transitioned into the song above...🙌🏾. #gatekeeper  #iwasntready 🤯 #govballnyc #metoo #dontyouwannatasteit

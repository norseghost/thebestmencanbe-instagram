I've been debating how to express my thoughts on this, or whether to say anything at all, but the more I speak to the women who've experienced this treatment the more infuriating and upsetting it became. There have been huge strides made for women's fight against sexual harassment/assault, but there is still SUCH A LONG WAY TO GO. I'm amazed because you would think in 2019, even the least woke of you would have some COMMON SENSE and enough HUMAN DECENCY to be aware that you SHOULD NOT grab, grope, touch or even GRAZE your hand against women without consent. 
The prevalence of this disgusting behaviour in Melbourne's nightlife is so disappointing, no amount of alcohol consumption justifies this behaviour, NO ONE IS THAT DRUNK YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING. Women deserve every right to go out, drink, dress and party the way they want, even sleep with whoever they want WITHOUT the fear of being assaulted and taken advantage of, without the stigma that just because she's made an ACTIVE CHOICE to do it with another guy that she's any easier for you - SHE DOESN'T WANT YOU. 
So here is a reminder to the people out there with no awareness, or even worse, are aware and INTENTIONALLY doing it (some of you know exactly who you are) JUST because a woman is out, drinking, tipsy, drunk DOES NOT make her any more available to you, and to those who don't actually behave this way but think this is the norm, EDUCATE YOURSELVES, it is not. Jesus Christ.

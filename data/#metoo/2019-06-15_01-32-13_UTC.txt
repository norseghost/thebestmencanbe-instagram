The victim in the William Kennedy Smith rape trial, her face obscured on CNN to protect her identity, testifies in court in West Palm Beach, Florida, on December 4, 1991. William Kennedy Smith was charged with the rape of the Florida woman at the Kennedy compound on March 29, 1991. Smith testified that they had consensual sex. Although three women were willing to testify that Smith had sexually assaulted them in incidents in the 1980s that were not reported to the police, their testimony was excluded. Smith was acquitted of all charges. ⠀⠀

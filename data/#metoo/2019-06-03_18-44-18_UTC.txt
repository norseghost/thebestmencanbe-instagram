How have you changed since 15? 🧐 I was very spotty, and clearly gay. I knew it, but I was too scared to admit it to myself. Sometimes people would shout “gay” at me in the corridor and I would just ignore it. 😇One day a boy said I had a 🍕 face... and I was so pleased that he wasn’t mentioning my sexuality that I nearly gave him a big kiss. 😘 He was SO fit, by the way 😉. The moment I came out as gay, at 19, was the moment I started to own my sexuality. Until you admit it, it is something people can hold over you. It limits you. Once you come out it is AWESOME! If I could go back in time I would come out at 9. 🤪 Despite being skinny I have always had a massive ass... so much so that girls (boo) would regularly squeeze it in the corridor 😂 #metoo . Remember that whatever or whoever you are make sure you OWN IT. 😙 •

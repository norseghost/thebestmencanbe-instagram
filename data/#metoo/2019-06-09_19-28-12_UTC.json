My first introduction to activism in any form was when I was in middle school and canvassed for same-sex marriage in Portland,OR.\n.\nThis year is the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots \u2014 a series of demonstrations by members of the LGBTQ+ community against POLICE RAIDS that took place at the Stonewall Inn in NYC in 1969. These riots were some of the most important events catalyzing the gay liberation movement. The idea of LGBTQ+ people marching through streets proudly sharing their pride, identity, and sexuality back then was radical\u2026\n.\nAs we celebrate this month, remember the history of PRIDE and the fearlessness and resilience of activists like Marsha P. Johnson who drove this movement, and the impact it has had on the world to show that LOVE IS LOVE IS LOVE IS LOVE . Remembering this and knowing what this movement has made possible for my own family/friends and the world brought me to tears multiple times while walking in Capital Pride in DC yesterday and celebrating with over 250,000 people.\n.\nWe still have so much work to be done in fighting for LGBTQIA+ rights and recognition \u2014 and while we continue to work, this #pridemonth we celebrate (even more than we should all year) how far we have come.\n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c\n.\npc @laurenrussell_12 \ud83d\udc9ethank you for marching w me Lauren + @kate.freda \u2763\ufe0f and for hosting us @marriottintl #lovetravels \ud83e\udd8b"

With GREAT anticipation, I've been waiting for this day to come, and now...it's finally here!!! It is my pleasure to share with the world this little golden nugget of a tune called, "Wherever You Go"!!!! 🎧🎵🎤😍🎤🎵🎧 I'd like to give a BIG shout out to Play MPE that has sent out this song today, WORLD-WIDE.

I'd also like to thank YOU, my Family, Friends, Dedicated Listening Fans, and Radio Stations for picking up this New Tune, and for sharing to hopefully be a blessing to each one who hears it.

I'd like to thank the amazing Andrew Horrocks, my Producer, who phenomenally takes a dream, and makes it into a reality, every-single-time we work on a song together.

I'd like to thank my Boyfriend, @bruce_jardine for standing by me through the rollercoaster of this process...I LOVE you.

And most of all... I'd like to thank, Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit Who have been my comfort, inspiration, and support, every step of the way.

This look was done in support of the millions of sexual assault victims in the world. This look was done in the color teal beacuse that’s the color of the sexual assault awareness ribbon. Sexual assault is a huge issue in today’s society. So big that one in every five women will experience rape or attempted rape in their lifetime.  Of these women, “Young women, low-income women and some minorities are disproportionately victims of domestic violence and rape. Women ages 20-24 are at greatest risk of nonfatal domestic violence8, and women age 24 and under suffer from the highest rates of rape”, (https://now.org/resource/violence-against-women-in-the-united-states-statistic/) , Approximately 60% of Black girls experience sexual abuse by age 18, Approximately 7.9% of Latinas will be raped by a spouse, boyfriend or ex-boyfriend during their lifetime, between 21-55% of Asian women report experiencing intimate physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime, 1 of 3 Native American women will be raped or sexually assaulted in their lifetime, and 32% of Black transgender people report being sexually assaulted while in police custody or jail.

This is an issue that effects no singular group. This is an issue that effects women of all races, sexuality’s, and religions. This is an issue that ruins lives of hundreds of women every day. This is an issue that pushes women to suicide, every day. Victims of sexual assault are 14x more likely to commit suicide than anybody else. This is an issue that must be spoken on and taken down. Power in numbers. Power in awareness. If you’re unsure of how you can be an ally, I dedicated the last few slides to you❤️ sources will be listed in comments.

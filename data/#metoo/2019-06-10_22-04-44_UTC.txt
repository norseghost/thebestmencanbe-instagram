This is the conclusion of the Asifa  Bano rape and murder case. I donâ€™t believe in the death penalty, even though this horrific crime pushed me to the edge. Everyday these heinous acts are becoming the norm. This is a specific male gendered violence problem.Until we re-teach men about the value of women and human life, this is a losing battle......ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’” #politics #feminist #feminism #london #blogger #smashpatriarchy #justice #metoo #timesup

Making abortion illegal doesnâ€™t end abortion, it just makes it less safe for women. Nations with legal abortions, easily accessible birth control, and thorough sex ed (such as the Netherlands) have some of the lowest abortion rates in the world, while nations with highly restrictive abortion laws (such as Latin America) have some of the highest.  If you truly want to reduce abortion, support the pro-choice movement.

Some people love wearing high heels. Some people physically can't. Some people wear them for special occasions only. And some people, just bloody hate them!⠀
⠀
However, in Japan, women have just submitted a petition AGAINST HIGH HEELS. ⠀
⠀
Why?⠀
⠀
These women, led by writer Yumi Ishikawa, are protesting against the fact that high heels are essentially compulsory uniform when working for many Japanese companies and when job hunting.⠀
⠀
It is said that there is a massive misogyny problem in Japan, with single women being labelled a 'burden on the state'. Women being forced to wear high heels at work is a blatant form of sexual discrimination, a case of which has arisen around the world over the last few years.⠀
⠀
No matter what your feelings are about high heels, it goes without saying that they can be somewhat painful to wear (some are relatively comfy, of course), especially over the course of a working day. No one should be forced to wear something that causes them pain, particularly whilst they are at work!⠀
⠀
We wish Yumi Ishikawa good luck in her quest to get this campaign passed and a law against this kind of discrimination put in place!⠀

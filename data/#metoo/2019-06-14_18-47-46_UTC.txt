Across our tables, we asked ourselves, “what would ambition look and feel like if it aligned with our feminine values?” Slowly but surely, the answers took shape. First things first, we would move away from what we should be doing and move towards what we want to feel. Enter ambition 2.0.

Unlike the constant quest to achieve (and proceeding burnout) of Ambition 1.0, Ambition 2.0 is a slow and fluid process, grounded in deep trust and acceptance. This is the journey from the external to the internal — FROM the validation of others TO the quiet confidence and inner-knowing we feel when our values align with our actions. When ambition is a value, not a process, it can be a sustainable and deeply nourishing journey in truth.

For some, ambition gets extended far beyond oneself, and is used as a vehicle to create impact and positive change in our surrounding communities (this is Ambition 3.0 — more on this later!).

Harsh facts about sexual abuse ⚠️
.
1. Over half of all children are subjected to emotional, physical, or sexual abuse & these issues are vastly underreported: it is estimated that sexual abuse is 30 times higher than official numbers.
.
2. Women with a history of childhood sexual abuse are twice as likely to experience harassment or assault than non-traumatised women, whose risk is already high, and 2/3 of incest survivors are subsequently raped.
.
3. Freezing is a common reaction in individuals subjected to #abuse, and acutely so to sexual abuse. Many report being in an altered state during that time. This reaction is not controlled by thoughtful consideration: it is an automatic reaction controlled by the brain's survival response system. #Trauma happens because of the failure in the system's ability to protect + the lack of protection or support from other people. This also influences re-traumatisation.
.
4. Survivors of sexual abuse suffer from a range of severe consequences. Those who experienced it in childhood have an altogether distinctly altered developmental pathway, and those who experienced it in adulthood see their brain being repatterned and their organism become re-organised: these changes lead to serious physical and #mentalhealth issues. The attacker that once was external becomes internal.
.
5. Therapies are often ill-fitted or limited because they focus on talking and reflecting, thus using primarily explicit memory when trauma is almost entirely held in implicit memory, registered outside of the chronological arch, outside of a language-based narrative, inhabiting the body.
.
These facts are harsh, yes. But they are real. When we acknowledge them, we can begin to tackle them. Sexual abuse does not fit the stories we tell about predators in dark alleys and fragile victims idling around. It is a complex, layered issue, and it is highly prevalent. It happens in your community. You likely know people who were abused and people who abuse. They buy bread and joke like everyone else.
.
A good news to finish off: #sexualabuse changes you, but you CAN heal your mind, brain, and body, and you CAN grow from it ♥️

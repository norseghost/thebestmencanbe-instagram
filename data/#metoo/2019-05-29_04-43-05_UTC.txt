I wish I could say that leaving an abusive relationship put an end to my traumas. But that is not the world we live in. Once I moved out, I had to contend with sexual harassment from my landlord. In my first week, he cracked a rape joke. I didn't laugh. And he didn't like that. 
I had to navigate being stalked during commutes. And I had to figure out divorce law and file on my own because my ex wouldn't split attorney fees with me. 
Too many people treat women differently if they perceive us to be single or poor or both. I was both, and walking through the world on a daily basis hardened me. I had to find ways to either comply with or pre-emptively scare off men who would retaliate if I resisted their demands. I learned to be distant. Cold. Indifferent. And I succeeded. 
The day the judge granted me a divorce, I walked out of the courthouse beside my ex. He started crying, and I turned away and walked down the sidewalk. I felt nothing. Nothing at all.

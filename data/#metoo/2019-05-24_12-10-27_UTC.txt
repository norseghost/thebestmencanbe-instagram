DAY 24- Become An Activist. 
Activism requires those that have a voice to speak out for those who don't. Addressing injustice and inequality in our society means calling out words, attitudes, and behaviours that perpetuate oppression. Slowly we can change the minds of the people we engage with. 
Here are some ways you can be an activist against sexual violence
• Educate yourself on the issue including IPSV
• Find like minded people  to dialogue with • Spread the word in your community and on Social 
Media
• Donate to your local centre
• Support survivors
• Lobby politicians
• Be the change you want to see in the world

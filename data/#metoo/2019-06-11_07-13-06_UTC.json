It\u2019s official: science has spoken.\nWomen are more likely to survive famine and epidemics, according to a study from Duke University in North Carolina that describes women as \u201clife expectancy champions.\u201dThe study concludes that, \u201ceven when mortality was very high, women lived longer on average than men.\u201d\nIt draws its conclusions from hospital records from the last 250 years, including during severe humanitarian crises. The investigation included seven specific groups of people experiencing hardship, famine, and disease, and who had a resulting life expectancy of less than 20 \u2014 but almost always there was one sex that seemed better suited to survive.\nSlave plantations in Trinidad and the US in the early 1800s? Women.\nFamines in Sweden, Ireland, and the Ukraine in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries? Women, women, women.\nMeasles outbreaks in Iceland between 1846 and 1882? Men. No, wait, just kidding \u2014 it was definitely women.\nIt\u2019s already well known that women live longer than men. Indeed, when you contemplate the list updated by the Gerontology Research Group that tracks all living supercentenarians \u2014 the awesome superhero name given to humans over the age of 110 \u2014 only one out of every 40 are male.\nAcross the planet the average life expectancy for women is 72 years and eight months, and just 68 years and four months for men. In the UK the gap is marginally smaller: women live on average to 82.9, and men to 79.2. But for the first time in a decade, the gap is no longer closing. \nAnd in non-scientific terms? It seems you don\u2019t need a latex suit and a film franchise to be superhuman anymore \u2014 you just need to be female.\n***\n#happiness #love #happy #like #life #communication #photography #inspiration #empoweringwomen #picoftheday #motivation  #family #peace #feminism #hearmetoo #womanempowerment #love #success #inspiration #positivevibes #womanpower #life #metoo #art #feminist #relationships #successfulwomen #motivation #slayqueen #menempowerment"

Women,
Sisters,
Mothers,
Our bodies are sovereign land - 
governed 
by our own spirit,
by our own blood. 
I dream for the day
When our bodies,
And our people’s lands 
are no longer shackled
By the beliefs of
Old Men
foreign to these lands. 
I dream for the day 
for how it used to be.
Where our blood 
made us
Powerful,
irrevocably Sacred.

Victoria, 22, complained that God does not believe she goes to church to worship him so she embarked on the habit of taking selfies in church while she's praying or singing or dancing.
"I'm tired of God not answering my prayers. He doesn't seem to hear me or see me so I decided to take selfies, videos and show it on social media. I figure God checks his instagram, snapchat, Facebook and whatsapp stories."

Meanwhile, God denied the girl's assertions with bewilderment. "Jeez! I see everything she does even when she goes to the bathroom to do the thing she does, not to sound like a perv but it's true. Am I supposed to tell her I see everything she does I-damnit? The #MeToo movement will string me up. Lookee here, Mr. Logic guy, I gave y'all freewill, didn't I? Leave me alone."

God was last seen updating his instagram story with "smh". In the meantime, the girl, who's just one amongst many, has continued to take selfies while praying in church. The trend, we believe, is here to stay.

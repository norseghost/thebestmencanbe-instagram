between you and me. 2019 
Mattresses are associated with repose and rest, pleasure and comfort, safety and security. The mattress in “between you and me” is upright, disembowelled and becomes a metaphor for violation. The work invites the viewer to engage in multiple levels of identification: victim, perpetrator and observer. “between you and me” focuses on isolating experiences of traumas that transcend beyond disturbing physical acts. By positioning this work in the public sphere, the piece contributes to an often neglected aspect of discourse surrounding sexual violation, assault and abuse.

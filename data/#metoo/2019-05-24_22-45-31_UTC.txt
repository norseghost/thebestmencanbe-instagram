If you have known me for a long time, you know this is my most unfavorite weekend of the year. 
No shame. DV is real and it was never more real than in 2007.  I’m a survivor. Not a victim. 
So happy to see some bright sun ☀️ Making a goal of just keeping really busy.  After a week of “momming” (is that a word?) so hard, thinking about two words: “Oxygen mask”. Peace. Love. Light. 💜 
As always, here’s my (award winning- the only thing I will ever give myself credit for) post about #DV.  Know you, your sisters, moms, aunts, and all women (and yes men too) deserve to be safe, emotionally and physically.  #domesticviolence #trauma #traumarecovery 
Read my thoughts in the link in my bio... share w someone you know who might benefit even a little.  #NoShame #LoveShouldBeSafe #MeToo

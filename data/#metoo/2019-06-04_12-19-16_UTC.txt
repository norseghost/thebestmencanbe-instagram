When you say “get over it” or “it’s been — years its time to move on...”, take a moment to consider what you are requesting.  It’s coming up on the 3 year mark since my world was changed forever.  3 years since someone I trusted and cared for deeply took a huge piece of me and destroyed it. He almost cost me my life without hesitation, thought or remorse.  Do I hate him? No.  Do I keep up with him? No.  I’ve left behind anyplace and everyone that associates with him.  Even though I’ve moved on, returned to a happy state of being, found peace and healed, the scars remain.  I won’t go to the town he works in because the idea of running into him makes me physically sick (he’s a firefighter ) and it’s hard because my kids go to school there.  I’ve lost friends, I’ve lost opportunities and for a while I lost my faith.  I no longer trust easily or freely and I still have nightmares.  I left a field I loved (training-gym) partly because that is where I met him and the atmosphere was ruined for me because everyone became capable of the same thing. 😢  Some have said don’t let it get to you and get... well, shitty because they just don’t UNDERSTAND.  It’s just not that easy.  I don’t share this for sympathy or out of anger or even to call out the man that has faced NO consequences but more to try and show that the aftermath of abuse and trauma don’t just go away.  They stay with us, influence us, haunt us and for some - reshape us.  Just because people seem to change (abuser and victim) it doesn’t mean what happened is “over” or “in the past”, it just means that the rest of the world can no longer see it.  Every year I travel the week before the “anniversary”; but not to hide.  I leave as a reminder that I survived and that I am blessed to have the life I have and that I should never take it for granted again.  #survivor #metoo #emotionalabuse #mentalabuse #heal #healthy #protectyourself #itsokaynottobeokay #mentalhealthawareness #ptsd #veteran #noshame #nevergiveup #keepfighting #family #scars

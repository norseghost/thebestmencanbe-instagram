I want to know "how" (logically) it is that a building being burned down accidentally during construction gains more attention and is worth the media's attention more than the lives of many many people in Sudan. So I ask of you for not only your time but your next few posts to not consist of something that you deem to be beautiful, or something you think is what people want to see, nor what will gain you a follower because that is not going to matter forever. This is only a temporary form a social media.
Who knows what the next best thing is going to be? It very well may be a platform where people talk about these things. Things of importance and in need of attention now. The point is we need to figure out what is important and what is not and in this moment I KNOW that products being sold via social media and the Notre Dame is NOT more important than the lives of those many of those who are getting hurt, raped, tortured, abused, killed, and Lord knows!!! - as they have ACTIVELY shut down the Internet in Sudan - there's only a few people who have access to telling us updates. And we're relying on doctors and we're getting voicemails every so often about it. But we need more. We need this to matter. Dedicate your time to things that matter.
Just as the #metoo and #blacklivesmatter stood tall and showed us truth and cleared us of ignorance. Let this be the next movement of what matters.

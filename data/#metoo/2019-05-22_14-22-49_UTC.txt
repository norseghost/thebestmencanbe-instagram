I need you she screams, 
staring into empty spaces.
Hoping white walls respond back,
sound of glass crashing can be heard miles away. 
It’s quiet 
All you can hear is the whimper of the broken heart, 
It’s nothing new, this is just the start. 
it’s not just glass today, there’s pools of wine, 
Chardonnay it seems.

Its quiet 
fragments of glass spread out on the floor, 
Pierced her skin, but the blood gushing out wasn’t red anymore. 
her eyes move up, gazing at the crystal of truth,
what reflects back, is the fake smiles she wore.

It’s quiet 
She still looks for him far and wide,
Her other half, her other side.
Yet never he was to be found, 
His bones and flesh lie buried in the ground. 
It’s loud

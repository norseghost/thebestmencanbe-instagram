@Regrann from @melanietoniaevans - We may or may not have realised that physiologically we have become addicted to the narcissist.

Meaning our bodies have been so used to the flooding of painful traumatic peptides, that our cells are fully primed, and have the surplus corresponding receptors, to receive regular doses of them.

Because of this, when we detach from the narcissist, we go through a chemical withdrawal process that ex-heroin addicts state is worse than trying to give up heroin.

I found, in my own healing journey (as well as assisting thousands of people over the last decade with theirs) that the only way to STOP having to battle with the excruciating white-knuckling, TERRIBLE withdrawal, is to do the deep inner healing on our Inner Being.

This then repairs the crippling peptide addiction cycles that make us susceptible to hoover attempts, or breaking No Contact ourselves, as well as being stuck in the obsession about the narcissist (even if we do stay away) for prolonged periods of time, which does not grant us the emotional freedom to create a new, happy or healthy life. 
I'd love you to connect to understanding exactly WHAT your peptide addiction is as well as HOW to recover fully from it - because it truly is key to recovering from narcissistic abuse.

In my Free Healing Workshop, I take you through a Quantum Process which detoxes your peptide addiction to narcissists. You can access this through the link in my bio.

Much Love xo ❤️

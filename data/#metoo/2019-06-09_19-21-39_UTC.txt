let’s make this clear. 
i do NOT have to be friends with people with different political beliefs. there’s no justifying being a shitty person by just “agreeing to disagree”. you support #Trump ? you’re blocked and also a racist. idc. you think that the government should control #womensrights and our bodies? bitch you super blocked. 
See, what had happened is that y’all think that it’s alright to just have these harmful opinions. Your opinion literally has bodies behind it: s*icide, r*ape, and forced abortions, but we have to still be friends cause that’s your “opinion”? Because it’s a “free country”? It’s a free block button, too. .

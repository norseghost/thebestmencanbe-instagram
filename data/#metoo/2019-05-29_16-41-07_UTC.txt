Posted @withrepost • @love_disfigure If you see me in the Gym, just say hi or smile at me. It’s rude to glare at people who look different. I don’t mind a quick look or even a quick stare and a double take. Yes I do look different but I’m not covering up for anyone that don’t like what they see. I’m a Child Burn Survivor and thankful that I’m still alive today. I had zero chance of survival so to be able to finally be brave and wear crop tops in the gym (not on the street) just yet 😁😉 is a huge step for people who have hidden differences. I’ve covered these scars all my blooming life so why shouldn’t they come out to breathe 🤣 Look bottom line is ‘I’m a Thriver’ and I love my body and Embrace every single part of me from my head to my toe. The #BodyPositive community might not be ready for us just yet but keep on sharing your Uniqueness and we will get there one day. #thisgirlcan #thriver4life #burnsurvivor #lovedisfigure #aeriereal #embraceyourself #metoo #showus #bodypositive #bodypositivity #scarappreciationday #scarsarebeautiful #october22 #strong

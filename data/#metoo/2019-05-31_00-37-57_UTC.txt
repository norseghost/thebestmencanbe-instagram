The last six years of my life have been, mostly, amazing. The last one year has been a total sh*tshow. I have survived/am still surviving it. And I want to honor it, not bury it in pretense or shirk recognising everything it has meant. This grey streak, that I keep dyeing? I want to let it grow out. (For now at least.) This is me, my journey as narrated by my hair. Hair I keep hiding. I donâ€™t want to hide it anymore, I want to let it be natural and real, the actual testimony to lives I have lived. The dilemma? I also want the bleached highlights and purple/blue/rose-gold lowlights ... those are me, too. What is a girl to do?? This is brave
This is bruised
This is who I want to be ...
This is #me / #metoo

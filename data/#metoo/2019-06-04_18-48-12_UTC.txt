Anger is a common feeling when starting the process of healing. You may feel anger towards your perpetrator, or towards others close to you who did not protect you.  Often, feelings of anger are more general, and spring from your grief for the deep loss you have suffered due to the abuse.  There are many things that you may feel you have lost; for example, your childhood, your innocence, your ability to learn, your ability to feel, or even your dreams. #notjustahashtagpodcast

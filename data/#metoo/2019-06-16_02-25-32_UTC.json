Sheesh. I had to go to a friends birthday pool \ud83c\udfca\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f party today and oh my... I\u2019m just wiped out completely from pretending. There I was trying to appear \u201cnormal\u201d to people I haven\u2019t seen in almost a year because I\u2019ve been withdrawing from years and years of so many big pharma meds which include Benzos, Opiates, stimulants, muscle relaxants, diet pills.. and the list goes on. The tone was immediately set with an unnecessary, slightly bitchy comment from my best girlfriend\u2019s wife about how I have been acting in recovery which I\u2019m not going to entirely go into because it still stings. But I didn\u2019t completely understand the nature of what she said and I was hurt by her comment, So I just kept to myself most of the day while still trying to be a supportive friend. I spent most of the time in the pool playing with the kids instead of mingling with the adults because I just didn\u2019t feel like socializing on an adult level. Much of the time was also spent with me silently floating on my back in the pool so that my ears were fully submerged to try and mask all of the noise as I am still very sensitive to a lot of sound and especially people\u2019s voices. Apparently it is quite common for people to be sensitive to the sound of other people\u2019s voices while going through benzo withdrawal. At any rate, I survived. I just am so happy to be in complete silence now. Well, in complete silence with my white noise. I felt very overstimulated but all in all needed to push myself a little bit further out of my comfort zone and try socializing. My muscles are so freakin sore and feel like jelly from treading water all day. But a good sore. I\u2019m so glad to be back in a place where I don\u2019t have to pretend and am very thankful for all of y\u2019all\u2019s support and allowing me to be myself in recovery. \ud83e\udde1 \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc .\n.\n.\n#benzorecovery #benzowithdrawal #soundsensitive #overstimulated #benzowarrior #metoo #ptsd #cptsd #anxiety #depression #endlongtermbenzouse #fuckbigpharma #onedayatatime #eatingdisorderrecovery #endometriosis #ade"

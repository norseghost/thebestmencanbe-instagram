One of the most powerful and impactful statements is “me too”. Recently, I have been extremely judgmental of myself. I have convinced myself that I am “less than” or that there is something wrong with me. 
Today during my therapy session, my therapist helped me recognize some of the demons from my past that have reappeared and are causing my memory issues. Most importantly, she validated my experience and reassured me that I’m not alone. 
The truth is I am struggling to hold on to my purpose, even with my sweet baby girl on the way. 
The truth is I’ve been experiencing extremely vivid nightmares and flashbacks from past sexual trauma. 
The truth is that even though my husband has been nothing but supportive of me not working right now, I am ashamed that I am not currently contributing financially to our family. 
The truth is, as we approach the birth of our baby, I am sad that neither my dad nor my father in law will get to meet her. 
The truth is that all of these things weighing heavily on my heart and my mind have caused me to feel paralyzingly overwhelmed. Which has affected my memory and ability to focus. 
Recognition is the first step toward healing. And the Solution: self compassion. It makes sense that with all of this going on in my head that I don’t have space to think of anything else. No more timelines, no more “shoulds”. I’m letting go of the perfectionist in me and am practicing compassion.

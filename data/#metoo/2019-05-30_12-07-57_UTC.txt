i love when we prosecute people for basic human decency  edit: this guy is being prosecuted for “conspiring to harboring fugitives” (letting immigrants seeking asylum into his home to give them food and water) (side note: he didn’t do anything other then give them water and food, there was no “harboring”) aka exactly what people were prosecuted for when they protected jews in the holocaust. and i’ll leave it at that.

I remember being 21, post all hell breaking loose in my life, and thinking "one day will be five years from now." And 5 surrendered years later, here we are with a life so beautifully messy that when I really sit down to think about it, I'm in awe. Shout out to all the strong women of faith who guided me and to the gentle men of faith who make me feel safe. So many blessings. ♥️ #celebraterecovery #cr #healinghappens #healingmatters #abusesurvivor #rapesurvivor #metoo #Godisgood #lookatwhatJesuscando #trustHim

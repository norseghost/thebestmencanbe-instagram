➖ This is dairy ❌
"COMPLAINT FOR CRUELTY • Still frail on their legs, lost in a new environment and hungry after already 20 hours of road in a crowded truck, the young calves are handled violently in a transit center near Cherbourg. On the footages we have obtained, a man loses control and bites on one of them, jumping on this newborn baby thrown to the ground. We complain about cruelty against this establishment.

This is what happens behind the walls. This is what you are funding if you still buy dairy products. Veganism is the only option because vegetarianism is NOT a solution. It’s a good step but not enough. Don’t be mad at people telling you this, we appreciate the effort but they need more. They need more, so do we.

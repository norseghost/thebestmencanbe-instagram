Mental Health Awareness Month ends today, but the awareness should not. I have been told by friends and family members that my depression and anxiety aren’t real or aren’t that bad, but I struggle with these things every day. I feel them so deeply that doing basic tasks sometimes requires coaching and convincing. 
My trauma, anxiety, and depression don’t define me. I am strong because I push past these things, no matter how hard it is. I am grateful for the people in my life who understand, acknowledge, and help me with my mental illness. They inspire me to do the same with others! No matter how hard it gets, keep pushing forward, and help others do the same!

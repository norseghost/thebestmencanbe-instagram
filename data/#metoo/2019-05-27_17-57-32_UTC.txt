Brains beats beauty, am I right?! I find intelligence so so attractive. Far more than looks!

Unfortunately all society tells us is attractive these days seems to relate to how women look. The boobs, the Botox, the fillers, the lips, the thinness, the big bums, the contouring, the eyebrows... Iâ€™m giving a huge shout out for all the intelligent ladies out there! The ones who study and learn and grow and make history. Your brain is so attractive to me ðŸ–¤

Of all the things to come out of 2019, I genuinely think @voxdotcom #imwithher-ing a character who was written to be insane and who literally - L I T E R A L L Y - studied Hitler as the inspiration for her speeches is my favorite thing. This is truly beyond parody. üòê This proves what I've been saying all this time: Everything the left does is projection. Everything. They've been calling the right Nazis for how long, now? And here they are defending this, inspired by Hitler. #vox #voxbox #bashthehash #bashthefash #beyondparody #metoo #feminism #feminist #feminists #femininitysofragile #intersectionality #intersectional #intersectionalfeminism #intersectionalfeminist

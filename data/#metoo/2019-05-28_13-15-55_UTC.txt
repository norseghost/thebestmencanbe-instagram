In the making of a victim during the cycle of abuse, the abuser will often groom the child by initiating touching in a somewhat subtle manner. This is to gauge how the child will respond to the contact. In many cases the child will freeze and not fight back because they are afraid and often flooded with so many thoughts and emotions.
In explaining her experience, Jeannie Mai says it started with her abuser touching her thigh and she recalls having a series of thoughts like, "this is my family, he is allowed in my house, this is cool, this is ok". She went on to say she was stunned and she "couldn't tell if was wrong"; she had never been intimately touched but she was "noticing it" as it was occurring. The abuse escalated over time with her clothes being removed and ultimately she was forced to touch him.
It is extremely hard for kids to reconcile in their minds the abuse being bad with the fact that it's a family member or close family friend whom they love and are supposed to trust that is doing something they think or know isn't right. This is part of the reason they remain quiet and are compliant.
Parents we have to teach our kids to tell us when anyone is touching them or saying/doing anything that makes them the slightest bit uncomfortable. Emphasize that family members and close family friends are included. Name them one by one if necessary so they understand that you mean ANYONE. These predators are using their familial status to confuse their victims into silence and compliance.
Tomorrow we will talk about the other reasons kids don't tell.

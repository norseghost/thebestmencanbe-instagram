Over the last several months, Iâ€™ve had to cope with trauma from a sexual assault that Iâ€™ve repressed for over six years.  Iâ€™ve been going through the motions of grief from denial, anger, humiliation, disgust, etc.  Itâ€™s been one of the hardest things Iâ€™ve ever had to do and a lot of of the time, I didnâ€™t think my mental health was strong enough to get me through this.  Iâ€™ve been pushing myself harder than I ever have to conquer this and not let the POS who did this to me, win.  He may have taken the most sacred thing I had at the time but he will not take over me and defeat me.  Iâ€™ll find a way to love the skin Iâ€™m in again ðŸ–¤#metoo

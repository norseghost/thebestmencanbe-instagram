today is the day i am honest with myself 
today is the day that i will choose myself
i can no longer live this life shackled to an eating disorder
for two years i have been manipulating my body into different versions, trying to decide which one i’m working towards and which one i’m running from

but today i am choosing to live this life in recovery. in sincerity. in humility. and in strength

today i recover for myself

today is the day i start to heal this nasty infection that has only held me back from living the life i aspire to live
i want to travel and hike and wear bikinis and be able to work a double at work without passing out
i want to be able to eat a meal without the calculator in my head, without the guilt that slowly invaded my every passing thought 
you are not the number on the scale
your beauty is not defined by others 
your worth is not defined by the notion of your insecurities

i want to recover. and i will.
i’m scared 
and i know some days will feel unbearable
but
recovery means being afraid but overcoming that fear 
recovery means being spontaneous and embracing the incapacitating rush of nourishment despite the overwhelming possibilities
recovery means learning to love yourself 
recovery means pushing through the long journey
because it will be worth it

my journey starts today

#storiesaremedicine and the actions we take today will build the world we want, or will keep us in a world of some else’s making.

I’ve been thinking a lot about the stories we tell ourselves and Monica Lewinsky. I’m a bit fascinated with Monica and her journey to become the amazing activist she is today.
.
For the the past few months, I’ve been thinking about her in those dark times when she was under attack. And I think about her mother, and how scared for her daughter she must’ve been.
.
How I think about Monica today is 180° from how I used to think about Monica. This morning I found myself in a conversation with a friend and I asked her “what would’ve happened if instead of standing by her man, Hillary Clinton said #I’mWithHer? How different would our world be today?” .

HYSTERIA 005 // I’m ashamed of how long it’s taken me to accept myself and feel comfortable in my own skin.
.
Until recently, I thought I alone experienced the hysteria caused by living in a body that society doesn’t value. But I’ve learned that every woman feels these emotions at some point, regardless of our zip codes or net worth. We universally share these scars.
.
So why do we suffer alone? Because we’re too damn ashamed to admit how we feel.
.
Our society is powered by the subtle trafficking of shame. You should try this plumper (read: your lips are too thin). You should go boxing with me (please fix your body). Let’s go take selfies in the poppy fields (your life is uninteresting). You really should try meditating (you’re too angry, too loud).
.
Women are shamed into conformity: We should have ambitions, but not too many. We should say “fuck” less, but dress like we want to fuck, while behaving as though we don’t want to fuck as much as we actually may desire. Our perspectives on child-rearing get more attention than our views on politics, science, art and literally every other subject.
.
And we’ve internalized it both as individuals and as a culture. We are labeled, stereotyped and stigmatized until shame eventually becomes part of our identity. It becomes the lens through which we see the world.
.
Shame is the feeling that there’s something wrong with us, that we’re not good enough. It’s exhausting; it makes us nauseous and want to disappear. And we’ll do anything to avoid it — shame other people, lie, post Photoshopped images of ourselves, and repel anyone who reflects our own flaws and weaknesses.
.
Our shame fuels our hysteria, which in turn feeds the shame we feel about losing control. We perpetuate the cycle because we’re so afraid of what will happen if we break it — that something we’ve been told was scarce and have worked for our entire lives will be taken away; that we will lose something we never had in the first place.
.
But if we accept ourselves and others and own up to our shit, we will break the cycle and flourish. We are enough. #hysteriaseries

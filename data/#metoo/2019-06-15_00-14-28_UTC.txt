There is an energy of #metoo happening in the Earth’s human collective right now and this includes ⁣
spiritual teachers. In case you are not familiar with it, the #metoo campaign is people (mostly women) speaking about the sexual abuse, exploitation or degradation they experienced (mostly) at work from men who had the power to influence their career or get them fired if they didn’t put up with it.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
But when it comes to spirituality, it is more than just sexual abuse, exploitation and power over others ⁣
situations that have been happening. It is also about getting trapped in low-frequency teachings and allowing low frequencies to hitch a ride on good and effective tools and teachings. ⁣⁣

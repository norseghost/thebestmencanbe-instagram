As the article by @buzzfeed notes itself, five total candidates advocate for stopping the arrests of sex workers and decriminalizing being a sex worker. These five are @sethmoulton, @tulsigabbard, @corybooker, @kamalaharris, and @mikegravel2020. Most of the candidates have dodged the question, with the exception of @billdeblasio, who stands by arresting sex workers.

The government needs to stop criminalizing sex workers, for the good of society and above all the good of sex workers!

#EllenDeGeneres is opening up about being sexually abused by her stepfather at 16
.
She revealed this in an interview on David Letterman’s Netflix show “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction.”
.
Ellen described her mother marrying “a very bad man,” when she was a teenager. At a time, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, Her stepfather proceeded to touching her breasts under the guise of checking her for lumps
.
Ellen said, "He told me when she was out of town that he’d felt a lump in her breast and needed to feel my breasts because he didn’t want to upset her, but he needed to feel mine. He convinced me that he needs to feel my breasts and then he tries to do it again another time, and then another time.” .
At one point, DeGeneres said, her stepfather attempted to break down her bedroom door, prompted her to escape via her window. She tried to tell her mother what was going on, she said, but her mother didn’t believe her, and in fact stayed married to the piece of shit for nearly two more decades
.
By sharing her experience, Ellen is hoping to help other women “to have a voice” and “to have power” when it comes to holding men responsible for assault.

I cannot believe this is barely covered on the news and I had to find out through Instagram what was going on in Sudan!! Notre Dame was ALL OVER THE NEWS and no one even got hurt. Donations poured in, rich people got involved. But I guess a building that belongs to white people is more important than black African Muslims. Sudan, you have support. Wish there was more we could do. We are tired of living in a system where these monsters in charge get to decide who deserves to die while the rest of us are left to feel helpless.

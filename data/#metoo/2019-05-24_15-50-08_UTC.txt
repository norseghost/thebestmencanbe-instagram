this is my season of empowerment... ⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
when I met my boyfriend, I was recovering from sexual assault and everything at that time was pulling me away from the Kingdom. God knew how my heart ached and longed for peace. ⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
and there @matthew_chedid_ was, so pure and full of light. he was ready and willing to lean in to #thegoodfight with me, and show me the Kingdom I was missing at the hands of darkness.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
and the biggest thing I have learned through matthew and his relationship with God, is that you have to be entirely willing to walk in Him. there is nothing within our identities that could separate us from the love of Christ. Jesus + nothing = EVERYTHING. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
it's time we embrace the identities God knows and loves us with. it's time we abandon the fears of our flesh for the love of Jesus. it's time we knew true empowerment. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness. Colossians 2:7

Just a couple of weeks ago, the Italian Parliament refused to reduce the VAT on tampons and pads. The so-called #TamponTax affects the finances of millions of women around the world. In Italy, tampons are classified as a 'luxury product' since 1972, imposing a 22% VAT on all products related to menstruation. .
The government refused to decrease the tax. A member of  majority coalition said on TV that tampons are bad for the environment and women should look for other methods to cover the periods. #mansplaining at its finest.
. 
An average pack of pads costs around 5-6 euro. Women use between one and two boxes per month. A family composed by three women like mine for instance, will spend an average of 25-30 euro per months just for sanitary pads.
. 
Imposing taxes on women's basic needs means targeting women for something they can't avoid. Considering sanitary products a luxury means denying  reality and promoting structural misogyny. .

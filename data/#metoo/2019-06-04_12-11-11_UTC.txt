UNDER HIS EYE!
Having a well needed #duvetday today... Not as in pulling a sickie from work, more just from life. My house is a mess & I'm lying in bed, eating crap & r√© watching the last few episodes of season 2 of #thehandmaidstale, which is due to start again on #ch4 this Sunday folks!! This scene at the beginning of episode 10 is so fucking poignant... #margaretatwood said, in regards the original book this series is based upon, that all of the stuff she describes in this story, is not fiction in the truest sense, they are all things that have happened in one way or another. What we see here is some kind of state sanctioned rape... And we only have to look at how child abuse has been covered up within the Catholic Church & many other powerful organisations to see that it's only a hop skip & a jump away. We only have to look at the #metoo movement to see that women's bodies have been routinely oppressed, abused, used, bought, sold, dictated to, for centuries and despite all the very solid laws in place to protect women, its not really working. We only have to look to the growing trend in the states currently of making abortion illegal, whether you are an adult or child, to see that women do not have power & ownership over their own bodies... Thank you Margaret Astwood & and all who have had a hand in creating this series... I look forward to seeing what season 3 has to say... And really, in regards current #americanpolitics, it could not have come at a better time. #womanhood #womenwhowrite #blackbritishwriter #feministwriters #feministfilm

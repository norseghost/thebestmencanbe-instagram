Ten years ago today, Dr. George Tiller was murdered in cold blood by an anti-choice terrorist while he was serving as an usher at his hometown church in Wichita, Kansas.

Dr. Tiller was known as “Saint George” because of his overwhelming compassion and commitment to reproductive rights. 7 years before he was killed, his abortion clinic was firebombed. He had 10 grandchildren.

We remember Dr. Tiller’s legacy as he was not the first, or the last, to be killed by anti-choice extremists. We are thinking of those who risk their lives to ensure that ours remain free. Rest in power, Dr. Tiller. ✨

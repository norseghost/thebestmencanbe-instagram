Sinner 
Evil 
Wicked 
Prideful 
Rebellious 
Failure •
There’s a great balance of understanding the nature of who you are.... verses WHOSE you are ! •
When we give our lives over to Christ, that does not mean we are no longer sinners and no longer evil. 
However, 
It does mean, that we are FORGIVEN! 
It does mean we now have hope! 
It does mean, that as we pursue Christ, we will become more like Him, and many of those sinful thoughts and behaviors will dissipate. 
However that does not mean we are sinless. 
We are born sinners. 
We are born evil and deceptive. We can not deny that. 
Because of Jesus Christ coming down to earth and dying for us, we no longer are bound to what we were born into on this earth. 
Today, I am full of gratitude. 
That despite my shortcomings, despite my sins, Christ still forgives me and is relentless in his pursuit of me. 
The king of kings extends HIS love and forgiveness to me and you, who are undeserving. 
Today, I meditate and reflect on thankfulness. 
Thankfulness for GODS UNFAILING LOVE, that COVERS ALL OF MY FAILINGS. •

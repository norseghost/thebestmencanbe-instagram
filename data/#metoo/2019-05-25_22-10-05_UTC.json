                        "text": "Through this new wave of feminism the concern that feminism is just women hating on men has been widely spread. People mistake feminism, which is the advocacy of women\u2019s rights on the basis of the equality of sex\u2019s, for misandry, which is the dislike or ingrained prejudice against men. \nIn the article, Misadry: the invisible hatred of men, it talks about mircroaggressions. These are subtle (or not so subtle) things we do to distance ourselves from minorities. Females often focus on the mircroagressions towards them, including: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t work for a woman\u201d, \u201cif you dress like a slut your asking for it\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m impressed that a women can do that\u201d , etc. Most women have been in a situation similar to the ones about, and these microagressions have been something we have focused on in feminism. However, we, as females, don\u2019t often look at it from the other side. Comments like \u201cmen only think with their dicks\u201d, \u201cmen just want a hole to put it in\u201d, \u201cbe a man\u201d, \u201creally? You don\u2019t like sports\u201d are microagressions that men are associated with. \nWhether we are conscious of these comments and perceptions we are making or not, they are present to some degree. \nThis is where the conversation comes in about women just hating men through the use of feminism. Women rally around one another when faced with the comments men make towards them, but dismiss the condescending and prejudice ideas in their own mind. \n#feminism #metoo #ibelieveher #ibelievehim #feminism #timesup #mybodymyrights #womenempowerment \n#thisisnotconsent #equality #strongwomen #strongmen #rapeculture #enoughisenough"

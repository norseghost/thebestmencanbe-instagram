Itâ€™s all about light! Those of you who have been following me for a while know, that I have an ongoing little series on my feed in which I present other artists whose works talk to me for one reason or the other. This might be because they use unusual materials and techniques or maybe because of the message of the artworks. In Carlos San Millanâ€™s case, itâ€™s all about the light! The Spanish artist, who now lives and works in Quito, Ecuador, masterfully â€˜illuminatesâ€™ his oil paintings. They maintain a fine balance between the figurative and the abstract and evoke atmospheres rather than details. He often finds his subjects in his immediate environment (rooms he lives in, the art studio), largely due to the belief that it is not necessary to go too far to find the universal and beauty in everyday things. Now, if that doesnâ€™t talk to me ðŸ˜œ! What do you think and do you have a favorite?

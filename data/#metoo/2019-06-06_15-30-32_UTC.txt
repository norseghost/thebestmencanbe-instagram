On the 11th June, the memorial sculpture 'Mother and Child', in honour of all victims of sexual violence around the world, will be unveiled. üó£ Jack Straw, former UK foreign secretary and international ambassador for JLDH, said: ‚ÄúThe JLDH statue is a fitting tribute to all victims of sexual violence, and especially the Lai Dai Han and their mothers who have for so long been crying out for recognition of their plight by the Government of South Korea. For too long these victims of Korean sexual violence have been forgotten and cast aside by society.‚Äù

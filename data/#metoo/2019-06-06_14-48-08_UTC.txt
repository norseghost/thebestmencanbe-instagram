I will never forget a field trip I went on as a kid where one of the activities was panning for gold. 
As we stood in a line at the large tin trough, we were excited because we just knew our pans full of dirt and soot just had to have some gold. 
We sifted it, swirled it and shook it around trying to discover the gold. It was a painstakingly slow process of removing all the dirt and allowing the gold to settle to the bottom.

As I was living in “the basement” for two years of my life, I realized God wanted me to see the gold He created in me. He was allowing all the dirt in my life to be shaken off, like bitterness I had towards my failed relationships, the false identity I received from men, harmful words I had spoken over myself and the negative things others had spoken over me, and my obsession with my appearance. 
I’d love to encourage you more in this week’s blog, with how God helped me find the gold that has made the whole of my life so much more valuable.

And He can do the same for you!

What is your responsibility as an employer?⠀
⠀
Employers have a duty to prevent harassment and discrimination; not limited to between colleagues within the workplace, but also by clients or suppliers.⠀
⠀
Fundamentally, employees and managers need an awareness of harassment and discrimination. They need to be able to distinguish between the two and to identify incidences when they occur. Training is key here.⠀
⠀
At Tell Jane, we offer training workshops, webinars and breakfast seminars to bring your people up to speed, and offer advice and guidance for tackling workplace harassment.

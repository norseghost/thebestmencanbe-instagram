Meek Mill has received a Social Justice Award from New York University's McSilver Institute for Poverty, Policy and Research. The annual award ceremony honours "Vanguards for Social Justice who are prominent in their fields and unafraid to use their platforms to help create a more equitable and just world." Previous winners have included #MeToo founder Tarana Burke.

Meek is a co-founder of the REFORM Alliance, an organisation attempting to reform the criminal justice system. Since founding REFORM, the organisation has raised over $50 million which will go towards aiding people trapped in the criminal justice system.

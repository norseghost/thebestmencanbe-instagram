"Myth: When someone discloses abuse they are probably being hysterical and overly dramatic in order to gain attention "Truth: Any disclosure of abuse is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. Most women living in threatening and controlling situations are reluctant to admit what is happening to them for many reasons. These include the shame of being abused; the fear of what their abusive partner will do if they tell anyone; their partner will have minimised and justified his behaviour to her, which will often cause her to believe it wasn’t ‘that’ bad and he was justified in being abusive. Rather than minimise disclosures of abuse, we must ensure the person disclosure feels validated in all they tells us and enable them to acces whatever support they need." https://www.restoredrelationships.org/about-vaw/mythbusters/

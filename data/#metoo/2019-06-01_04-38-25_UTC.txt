We live in a melting pot. That is one of the many reasons why America has been so successful in becoming the greatest country on this planet, #Earth! People came here for freedom, that freedom is under attack right now. I love all people, from all countries, if you are a good person... but #Nationalism is what keeps our country functioning. At this time #globalism is not the answer, it would bring worldwide/global #socialism. If this were to happen, it would cause a lack of competition, economically, sending the world's population back into the stone ages. The world couldn't live off of US $$ forever, especially if America was destroyed by socialism. There is a better, yet to be known economic system, similar to capitalism, but with less government regulation and more checks and balances, by the people, for the people. This is what we have to look forward to. To work towards, together, with freedom and liberty for all! Other countries will follow suit, only with an open, unbiased and truthful #world-wide-web ...With globalism, no nation would exist. Only a world of chaos, once again fighting for dominion, as we have seen throughout history. Globalism would be a humongous fall backward.

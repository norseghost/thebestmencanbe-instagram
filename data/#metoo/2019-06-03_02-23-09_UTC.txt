"His Hand is Gone But I Still Feel It"
.
.
This is not a reflection on my spouse! This is based off of something that happened to me a while ago. Just visually venting. My friend Janelle told me I should be authentic with work. Even when it's not something pretty that people will like. Normally I transition the ideas into positive things but this time I really couldn't turn the piece around to be cute or happy. So it just is. This is how I express myself, my experiences and the world around me. .
I am ok. Just using healthy outlets to express myself!

The monsters are out there ladies. Stay safe.

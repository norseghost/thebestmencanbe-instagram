Weaponizing my mind against those that have made me weak. One of those people is myself. I’ve always been someone who has found something to distract me from the pain, the pain I’ve inflicted upon myself, the pain others have inflicted on me. I leaned on boys, sex, men, alcohol, weed, and a brief stint of oxy. My life has always felt like a series of unfortunate events. From rapes, to alcoholic and suicidal family members, to more rapes and assaults that lead to a procedure, to depression, to my own suicidality and mental illnesses. I’m starting to see the clouds part for the sun. It’s just taken a long time and there are still many bumps in the road to overcome, but I AM overcoming. .

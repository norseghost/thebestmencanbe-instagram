The #MeToo movement may have put gender equality in the spotlight, but the facts show that we still have a long way to go before women are on level pegging with men. Gender bias tears at our social fabric, reducing the value of all of us. It is not just a human rights issue; it is a tremendous waste of the world’s human potential.

By denying women equal rights, we deny half the population a chance to live life at its fullest. Political, economic and social equality for women will benefit all the world’s citizens. Together with Goal 5, we can eradicate prejudice and work for equal rights and respect for all. ———————————————————————————— 🎵Eko—@iamkizzdaniel –> ( https://smarturl.it/KizzDaniel.Eko) ————————— 🎥 @blackodaveledoux ——————————————————————————————— —————————————— #eko 💚 #TOGETHERBAND #BOTTLETOP #globalgoals #wearitshareit #shareyourgoal #GENDEREQUALITY #sharedgoals #instagoal #sustainability #tiptoe ❤️❤️ #sexystyle #women #gender #equalty #standupforyourrights #Tiktok #tiktokgirls #tiktokmemes #cavasaigner #regles

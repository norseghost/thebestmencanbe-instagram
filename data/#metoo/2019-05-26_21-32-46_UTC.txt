#WhyIStayed (part 2 of 2) || We might stay in toxic, dangerous relationships with people because we think we can help them. That it will be our love that saves them. But perhaps we are not the ones meant to help them with their internal challenges. Perhaps our presence and comraderie only serves to further enable them. At the end of the day it’s up to each of us to do our own work. ⁣⁣

We may care about someone but that does not necessarily mean it’s a good idea to be in a relationship with them. Society idealizes and pushes for the concept of loyalty, but you are under no obligation to stay loyal to someone who degrades you, controls you, or endangers your life. There are some people whom we can only safely feel love and compassion for from a distance. We might feel guilty about having to make decisions for our own safety and wellbeing, as though we are leaving them alone in their struggles, but we cannot allow that guilt to put us in harm’s way by keeping us entangled in toxicity.⁣⁣

It’s absolutely not necessary to drain yourself for someone else’s happiness. Leaving is not easy. Healing is not easy. But you have within you all the courage you need to walk away from what hurts you and toward what nourishes you.⁣⁣

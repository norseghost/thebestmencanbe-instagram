Don't hold them hostage of your hideous personality. Let them be loved by people who offer them the love they deserve, let them fall in love with themselves, let them be free to make their own decisions in life, let them live.\n\u2022Your ways are suffocating and you are preying on someone else's happiness, which makes you the shittiest of all."

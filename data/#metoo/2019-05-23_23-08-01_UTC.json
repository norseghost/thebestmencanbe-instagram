                        "text": "Remember multiple months ago when I posted a video on IGTV about there being a lack of substance in today\u2019s  culture. Then proceeded to delete all of my posts and never log into Instagram again.? #metoo \nThroughout that time, redirection was not on my conscious I was just going about life, overacting about things, not feeling much, and definitely just simply living. However a few months after I posted that video life changed and \u201cjust going through the motions\u201d left the list of options. \nOnce that occurred I landed at a point where I was just like \u201c I\u2019m not going to kms but I really wouldn\u2019t mind life being over right now\u201d ( this got deep fast but I promise you it tyes into my point) I was just genuinely over it and I ran through the typical storyline of life and just thought about how \u201cbad\u201d things are guaranteed to happen along the way and I just didn\u2019t see the point. \nHowever, throughout this time I spent more time with God. Read the Bible in my free time, listened to Christian music 25/8 and watched sermons.. FOR FUN \ud83d\ude33( Specifically @wearetransformation ) . It was the only thing giving me peace when literally \ud835\udcee\ud835\udcff\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcfb\ud835\udd02\ud835\udcfd\ud835\udcf1\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcf7\ud835\udcf0 seemed useless. And eventually, birthed out of that situation came tbhTochi. \ntbhTochi the teen girl who wants to help other teens in a world which has no sure sense of direction. tbhTochi who\u2019s still learning but now wants to share what she has learnt. tbhTochi who\u2019s realized that she maybe the answer to a generation of teens who are fleeing Christ simply from a lack of representation of those who are not. To be Honest. Tochi."

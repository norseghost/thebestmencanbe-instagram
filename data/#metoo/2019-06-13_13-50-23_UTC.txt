From the prosecutor in William Strampel's case.  My former Dean is now a convicted felon, including a guilty conviction for misconduct in office.  His behavior as a public official was noted as criminal.  Just because the jury didn't get him on the 2nd degree CSC charge doesn't mean that they didn't acknowledge his guilt overall.  He was also convicted based on how he failed to properly supervise Larry Nassar as his boss.  I felt convicted to break my silence after watching all of the victim impact statements and after seeing Rachael Denhollander's open letter to Strampel and his response to her.  He mocked her.  I could no longer stay silent about who he was and is.
.
You know what, the jury didn't get him on all of his behavior, but they got him and I am grateful that I got on that stand and testified under oath.  As Rachael Denhollander wrote to me yesterday, now it is publicly known who Strampel is.  Today is a new day and the disappointment and sadness that I felt yesterday is gone.  Justice was served, especially for the over 500 girls and young women that Nassar victimized and Strampel enabled.  More truth is known.  More light has been brought to the darkness of lies, silence, and institutional abuse.  May more truth and justice come forth.

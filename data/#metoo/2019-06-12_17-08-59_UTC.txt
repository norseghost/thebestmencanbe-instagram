This month we will continue our healing journey by focusing on
•How to provide support for someone who is a trauma survivor while taking care of yourself
•Making grounding stones
Supporting those around us that have been affected by domestic violence or sexual abuse can be very challenging, and even draining when we do not have the tools to manage. We want to be there for those around us, but we also need to ensure we are coming from a grounded space and coping ourselves. This month we will be sharing ways we can be supportive of those that are survivors of trauma. Whether you are a loved one or friend, you are welcome to join us in this powerful discussion. We will also be making grounding stones. When we are grounded, we not only make better decisions but we behave in ways that are more authentic and own our power and strength. A grounded person is one who is much more likely to remain calm in the face of chaos – you will leave with a physical reminder that you yourself have created.

#LateNight arrives in theaters today. A modern comedy with a twist, the film stars Mindy Kaling as an aspiring comedian (Ms. Kaling also wrote the script) and the incomparable Dame Emma Thompson as Katherine Newbury – a legend of late night television. The film features at its core a love story, not for a traditional male lead, but instead shifting the narrative to the women’s devotion to their careers and burgeoning professional respect for each other. In the process, it explores several key dynamics: the obvious ones of gender and race as both characters contend with the challenges of breaking into media’s all-boys club and the nuances of diversity hires; as well as the gendered impact of age and the disproportionate distribution of power in the professional sphere. The role of Katherine Newbury is also a-not-quite subtle nudge by Ms. Kaling at the lack of real-life female late night talk show hosts. The only time a woman has led a major network late show was in the 1980s when Joan Rivers hosted Fox’s short-lived The Late Show. TBS’ Full Frontal with Samantha Bee comes closest to meeting this standard today. Katherine Newbury also stands out for the complex commentary her character offers on feminism and the #metoo era. A wholly unpleasant and neglectful individual, her gender is never used to satisfy cliched stereotypes of the sympathetic or particularly kind female boss who acts as a mentor and ally for younger women. Rather, she remains unapologetically imperious, if not downright territorial, about her earned success. A summer comedy, Late Night still manages to set itself apart from other light fare films by offering a smart and refreshing take on standard the workplace tropes.

We all go through heartbreaks, donâ€™t we? (I donâ€™t believe those who say they donâ€™t;) And because it so damn painful sometimes we feel that we are, in some way or another, at fault, and we dislike ourselves for it, and we get ashamedâ€¦ ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”
Shame on you, Shame!  How dare you make me feel bad for loving.  Yes, that was a big ass mistake and Iâ€™ll be more careful next time!  But please - go away, Shame!  There is no room for you in my beautiful bleeding heart #shamenomore

Came across this awesome mural on Wabash street Chicago between 8th and 9th street that highlights the fact that harassment is a serious issue. This artwork was created by a student from The University of Arts and the installation is titled "Stop telling Women to Smile." It shows the faces of 25 young women who have been catcalled or otherwise harassed while walking out in the city.

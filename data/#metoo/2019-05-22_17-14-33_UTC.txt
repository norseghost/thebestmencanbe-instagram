This evening, together with my colleagues we went to watch a play ‘This is what happens to pretty girls’ written by Ken Kwek, an award winning screenwriter, director, playwright and author. 
The play was about an undergrad and a lecturer begin a precarious flirtation. Two workmates on a date that each remembers very differently. A long lost bogeyman returns to draw new blood from old scars. 
Eight bodies collide. Eight souls crisscross. Eight lives get entangled in a web of pain, shame and heartbreak. And the world as they each know it will never be the same again. ‘This is what happens to pretty girls’ when many women don’t report - which is NEVER heard, told or shared.  The emotions of sadness and fear is NEVER easy for the victim to express and to suffer in silence. 
Before the show started, we had the privileged to meet Ken. 
You still have time to catch the show which ends on Saturday 26 May.

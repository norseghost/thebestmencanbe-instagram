I left him more than four years ago, in 2015. Yet here he is, staring at me through a #MagnifyingGlass.\n\nHe\u2019s blocked on every social network. I\u2019m no longer connected to his family \u2014 or mine \u2014 and nearly every friend I trusted and treasured. \nToo many people didn\u2019t believe me or were just too horrified to support me through a situation that become *more* brutal over time, not less. My god, my #grief. \nMy former husband is an engineer at @Google. Since learning of his lies, actions, addictions, manipulations, I\u2019ve been #hacked on this platform and others. For example, in 2018, someone or #somebot was operating a fake Facebook page in my full legal name to sell porn and sex. \nThe account had thousands of fans, friends, and connections. How much #money did that page generate for Facebook? For the page\u2019s operators? For the women who were selling their bodies by choice or maybe force? For all I know, the page was showing #trafficking victims or monetizing #revenge porn. \nFacebook refused to shut it down for more than two months. Daily I\u2019d report it. Daily my friends would report it. Daily we\u2019d receive assurances that the page wasn\u2019t a violation of community standards. \nIf a page that\u2019s been used to abuse someone isn\u2019t a violation, then it\u2019s a #reflection of the values of the company. \nOne day, the page just disappeared. No explanation.  Poof. Gone.\n\nI don\u2019t want to live this horror. It haunts my dreams, breaks my #spirit, terrorizes every connection I seek to form. No matter what I\u2019ve done to move on, no matter the time I\u2019ve spent in court, under police protection in a safe house, or hiding it in plain sight, it follows me across websites. \nThis is how social media abuses a #survivor who stood for #healing and #justice and falls to her knees to beg for #refuge and protection. \n#MeToo #NiUnaMenos"

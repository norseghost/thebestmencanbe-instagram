A very tough weekend. People need to think about how they speak to one another, strangers or not as you have no idea what people are going through and how your words and actions can affect them. 
After being threatened and sworn at at work on Saturday and spending Sunday in hospital its finally time to look after me! 
I must give a big shout out to the paramedics on scene who understood and thought about me in every step of their care. Explaining every move they were doing and getting me to hospital and making sure I was in an appropriate environment for my anxieties. They were exceptional ðŸ§¡ðŸ§¡ #WordsHavePower #ptsd #kidneyinfection #selflove #thinkbeforeyouspeak #speakout #donthide #metime #metoo #bpd

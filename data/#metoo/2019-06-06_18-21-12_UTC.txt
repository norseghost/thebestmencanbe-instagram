I've been worrying about the influence of Tony Robbins' in women's empowerment spaces for years. (One of my essays -- see link in profile --- about TR is from 2016 and the other is from 2018.)⠀⠀
⠀⠀
To me, his teachings about femininity and masculinity appear to be pure patriarchy and misogyny..but all gussied up in the language of spirituality and self improvement. (He’s endorsed the books of Warren Farrell, who is often referred to as “the grandfather of the men’s rights movement”)
⠀⠀
This spiritualized gender binary is arguably the opposite of empowerment -- it reinforces beliefs that marginalize women -- yet so many women's empowerment coaches use the same ideas in their own work with women. Especially the ones who've trained with him. ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
I believe this is dangerous. Ideas like these arguably contribute to the marginalization of women and even to sexual harassment and abuse.⠀⠀
⠀⠀
Which I was not surprised about TR's apparent #metoo "misstep" last year or by the recent Buzzfeed articles.
⠀⠀
All this to say...if you work with women as a coach or healer and Tony Robbins is one of your influences, I invite you to reconsider his teachings and gender ideology through a feminist lens. ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
This is not a condemnation of you. It's an invitation. ⠀⠀ with so much love + justice,⠀⠀

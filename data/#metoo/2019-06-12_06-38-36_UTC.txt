sometimes you’re wrong about the people you think you can trust. i sure was. and it hurts. thinking you can trust someone and then being hurt by them more than you’ve ever been before and probably ever will be. we were becoming friends. i was happy to have a new friend i could trust. he offered to take me home like a good friend. he cleaned up my throw up and told me not to worry about it. and then he raped me. how am i supposed to be able to trust anyone ever again. how am i supposed to now go out into the world and have healthy relationships. how do i know people don’t have ulterior motives? especially with guys. i find it really hard to trust guys. especially as i meet new guys in college. i’m still mostly able to trust all of my old guy friends. but sometimes i still feel uneasy around some of them. all of my friends at college right now are girls and i just can’t imagine being friends with any guys that are friends with my friends. how do i know i can trust them. how do i know that they won’t treat me or any other girl poorly any chance they get. how do i learn how to trust again? how do i make friends? how can i trust my judgement?

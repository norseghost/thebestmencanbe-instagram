The British High Commission and Pranoti Surve, Global Intelligence Manager of @facebook  organised a great discussion about Sexual Harassment for Security Industry yesterday, I am honoured to sit on the panel alongside women whom I respect very much Deputy High Commissioner of UK Alexandra McKenzie and AWARE ED Corinna Lim, women who have worked tirelessly to tackle this topic together with some of the brightest minds of the security industry. Thank you James Spalding of Abn Ambro for doing a great job facilitating this.

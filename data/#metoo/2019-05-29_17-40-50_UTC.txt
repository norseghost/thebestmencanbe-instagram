You know when that 1 chocolate from the box turns into the entire box? Thatâ€™s binge eating.

I think most of us have moments of binging on food... Unfortunately for some this can become a much more serious eating disorder.

For the majority of us, binge eating is not that frequent but we still feel AWFUL afterwards. We feel guilty, ashamed of all the food weâ€™ve eaten, frustrated we just failed another diet.

Best advice Iâ€™ve received about how to deal with a binge: ðŸ‘‰ Stop thinking about what youâ€™ve eaten
ðŸ‘‰ Do not try to count all the calories
ðŸ‘‰ Check why you did it - stress? Upset? Happy? Hungry?!
ðŸ‘‰ Forgive yourself, you are human
ðŸ‘‰ Start fresh immediately. Donâ€™t prolong the binge
ðŸ‘‰ Go back to your normal eating and exercise. DO NOT not eat or over exercise to compensate

FORGIVE YOURSELF ðŸ–¤

P.S. If you are binge eating frequently and causing harm to you and your health, please do see a medical practitioner - I share my views of the world and I am not a medical expert.

note: THIS IS NOT MY STORY THIS IS @indiaaboutfeminism 's STORY
...
i absolutely hate the fact that this type of toxic feminism exists in our cruel world and i truly believe that it should not be accepted and we need to take it down.
in other words,,
THIS IS NOT OKAY.
THIS IS NOT REAL FEMINISM.
THIS IS NOT BEING AN EMPOWERED WOMAN.
THIS IS BEING A CRUEL AND RUDE PERSON.
i truly hope this man is okay and i truly apologize on behalf of all feminists & activists that he had to go through this unjust experience. 
PLEASE SHARE & SPREAD THE STORY!

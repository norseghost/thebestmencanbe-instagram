Meet the PiPsters

Part 1 of 4
This summer and beyond Power in Place has expanded our team from 1 to 16.  Each of our contributors will be enhancing the project through their own unique backgrounds and insights. 
In order for our audience to get to know our collaborators better (and sharpen our own interview skills), we are interviewing each other.  My partner Victoria is a rising junior at Vassar College from Long Island. She hails from a large, loving Italian family.  It’s where she draws her strength, as well as, where she sharpens her political debating skills.

When asked what made her joyous this year, Victoria replied returning home this summer after a semester of indecision if a poli sci major is her true calling. 
LISTEN TO HEAR WHAT SHE ULTIMATELY DECIDES.

My follow up question to Victoria  was inspired by #RebeccaTraister ‘s  #GoodAndMad Reading her book made me embrace the value of women’s anger during our current #metoo movement.  Being angry for women is often disapproved of. However our collective rage channeled towards positive change will move us toward  #equality & #parity. 
What made Victoria mad was discovering one of the prosecutors in the Central Park Five trial was a trustee of her college, an institution that she trusts for their integrity and openness.

Lastly, I wanted to know if women today feel that their voices are heard when they do speak up and demand change. 
For Victoria, it was taking action through a campus wide petition circulated to demand the removal of to Linda Fairstein from the college’s board.

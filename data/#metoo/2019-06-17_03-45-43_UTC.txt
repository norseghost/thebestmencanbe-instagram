Itâ€™s been a year. 
And it makes me shudder a bit, to think about how many people know what Iâ€™m referring to without further explanation. Being so open about a traumatic personal situation comes with many mixed emotions.

A year ago today I was raped. It absolutely broke me. I missed lots of days of work, I barely slept for weeks, I was scared and paranoid for months. I even bought a gun. I felt entirely out of control of my own life and emotions. 
This year has been quite the journey of self-discovery. The universe put a handful of influential people in my path, leading me to acro yoga, ninja warrior training, and personal development audio books. Being at such a low forced me to look deep inside and work on myself. Facing physical fears at the gym has directly correlated with processing emotional trauma that Iâ€™d suppressed. Through training, Iâ€™ve learned a level of emotional control and mental discipline I never knew possible. Fear isnâ€™t real. Fear is an emotion. We control our emotions.

I canâ€™t say where Iâ€™d be if I hadnâ€™t found AXIOS, but I can say that today, Iâ€™m the strongest version of myself Iâ€™ve ever been. We control our own destiny, and if we truly believe that, we will always be stronger than the storm. ðŸ’•

Got a lot of comments recently that are deeply disturbing and often bordering on abusive. They’re disgusting and hard to hear but also demonstrate the inbuilt structures that we’re challenging with this campaign. So no ‘I didn’t ask you’ to share misinformed and misogynistic views on our posts, but in doing so, these views are exposed to be just that and can be properly and effectively challenged. .

Today I sat with my own power. At first I wanted to define it by what I was doing, accomplishing, and being strong. But diving deeper I found my power is my softness.

It comes from my ability to feel deeply. It is strengthened by my grounded presence not easily moved from myself. It is anchored by willingness to surrender to a bigger presence. 
There is deep power in holding still and surrendering to the moment. Not acting until the time to act. Staying in the uncomfortable places until the discomfort transforms. Sometimes it is more powerful to acquiesce to the heavy hand to gain the advantage in the long run. 
I had a vision of power. It looked like my heart being torn from my chest. But my heart didnt die, and in it's ability to keep beating in the face of hate and violence it had the power to transmute force into compassion.

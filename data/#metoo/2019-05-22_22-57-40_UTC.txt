If you actually care about facts and statistics, you’d see and understand that the overwhelming majority of all abortions are done out of “convenience” it might not out right put that as the reason but I quote CDC records and several departments of healths for reasons including :“doesn’t want children at this time”  and “social and economic reasons”. People are so irresponsible and sick. They act like this is an easy way out. Did you know that woman who have had abortions are 155% more likely to commit suicide. Keeping abortion legal and easily accessible isn’t protecting women. We are setting them up for failure and an “easy” escape from their “mistake”. Banning them will make the majority (not all) of people to look for other options. Yes it’ll still happen unfortunately, but not at the rate it is now. •

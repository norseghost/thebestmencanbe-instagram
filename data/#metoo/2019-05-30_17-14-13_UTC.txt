🌱CALM
Put the heavy load down for a moment, take 5 minutes to enjoy relaxing comfortable breathing.
Inhale all the way to your tummy for 7
Hold for 4
Exhale or 8, relax any areas of the body that you notice tension.

🌱THOUGHT 
Let's scrub out that word ANXIETY that you are carrying around not knowing what to do with it, because it feels like that's it I have anxiety. Feels hopeless like something that's not going away. I am anxiety. That's a scary thought, and scary thoughts will cause you more stress and anxiety. Your heavy load is getting heavier.
.
🌱REPLACE
Instead of anxiety. Replace with. I am experiencing anxiety, this is my stress response, I am not my stress response, this is a mind & body reaction to stress in my mind & or body. There is a cause, I can learn ways to calm this down, allow myself to do this, remove self doubt by trusting & trying. My stress response will know there's no danger because I'm showing it, & my thoughts are more helpful, less unknown. Then when i feel calmer my mind will feel more able I can then look & investigate what is causing stress & take actions to reduce the cause, reduce the anxiety.

🌱REWORD 
Put the heavy load down labelled, 'I have anxiety, I own it I cant put it down. 
It's fear, you're unknowingly holding on to fear & that's the main ingredient in anxiety. 
It's not your fault, there is alot of information out there of how anxiety feels & with scary images, we're getting the wrong idea about it. 
Don't get me wrong experiencing panic, gad & agoraphobia was the most scariest time of my life. It felt horrific! But thinking of it as a dark cloud, a monster, an uninvited murderer etc 'Anxiety ahhhhhhhhh run away' didn t help me it made everything worse.100× worse.
It's not a monster, it is my best mate. it's a response to stress in my mind, body or both, it's a helpful sign the cause is too much for my health mentally or physically & its time to investigate, get info from my doctor, talk, release emotion, look at areas of my life for causes. Etc.

🌱Not you. Not faulty. Look for cause.

I walked into my first REAL therapy session. I was super comfortable, I showed no emotion... yes! This is a piece of cake! (What i thought). By session 4 she thought I had the makings of a sociopath. I was able to tell details of my trauma as if i was talking about a movie on tv. There was no association between me and my past. She made me realize how deep my trauma had been buried. I had completely dissociated. I was told i suffer from ptsd, anxiety, depression and ptsd w/ dissociative features. I literally wanted to scream YOU DONT KNOW ME! 😂 However, it was all true! Therapy helps, sometimes we need help that is beyond the scope of our family and friends. Seek help even if you think “it’s not that serious”. 💚💕 #journey2freedom #womenempowerment #womeninspiration #mentalhealthawareness #personalblogs #inspirationalquotes #whyididntreport #metoo #womenempowerment #womeninspiringwomen #womensupportingwomen #women  #anxiety #mentalhealthissues #ptsd #depression#mentalhealthmatters #blacktherapist #therapy #mentalhealthawareness

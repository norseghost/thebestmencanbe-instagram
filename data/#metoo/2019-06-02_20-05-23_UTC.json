A cursory glance at the boardroom status quo worldwide will show that they are mostly occupied by men, despite the fact that in many so-called first world countries, like my home country, Germany, most university graduates are women. They also often achieve better results. But what happened to them after graduation? Did they really study to end up as admin clerks, or in front of a stove, running errands, and raising children? Why did they change their plans? What put them off a career trajectory that may have led to corporate leadership?\n\nIntimidation. Discrimination. That\u2019s what it is. There are no two ways about it. And because of those factors most females lack self-confidence. All the politically correct talk in the world can\u2019t hide that men are still defending \u2018their\u2019 territory, by not allowing too many women into senior positions and when it does happen it is mostly for window dressing purposes. The women who make the grade often have to sacrifice a family life to work harder than any of the men.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#femmebought #feminism #metoo #imwithher #femaleleaders #women #sanfran #digital #tech #inclusion #diversity #woman #womaninbusiness #womenempowerment #womenhelpingwomen #workingwoman #workingmoms #discrimination #power #womeninpower #leadership #girlboss #entrepreneur #ceo #entrepreneurlife #entrepreneurship #business #businesswoman #businessowner #girlboss #50intech"

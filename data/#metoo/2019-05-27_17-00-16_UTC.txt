Acrylic on canvas 20x20
This painting is dedicated to the countless people who have suffered severe trauma, abuse, rape, sex workers, sex trafficking survivors that are suffering from mental health conditions. It’s about how hard it is to speak about your pain or share openly about what you have had to face because it isn’t pretty. There’s unfortunately a stigma surrounding these delicate topics that forces victims to feel ashamed. Don’t suffer in silence, seek help. Make an appointment with a mental healthcare provider. ❤️

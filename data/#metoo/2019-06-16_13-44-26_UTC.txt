Caught @griffintheatre “Prima Facie” this weekend at the SBW Stables. @miss_harbinger performance was a tour de force, alluring, captivating and relentless. Season at the stables is sold out but it’s coming back to Parramatta. This is a must see. Caution: Please read the provided content warnings on the Griffin Theatre website.

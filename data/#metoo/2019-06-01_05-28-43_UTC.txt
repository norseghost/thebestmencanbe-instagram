So much has happened since this little beauty was born. Our last little poppet and our family was complete. However there has been so much going on in our life ever since James and I met, it’s been like we’ve been continually fighting fires. Now we are in our forever home (unless we decide we want to move again instead of extend) and all has been settled, life has had time to catch up with me.
I won’t go into details on here but I suffered so many types of abuse all through my life and I have always said I won’t go digging for issues. Life has always had enough going on. Now things have had time to stand still past experiences have been bubbling up from under the surface.
Maybe, I’ll write a blog post at some point but I’m going back to counselling. Things are coming up to the surface and I’ve been feeling extremely depressed, recoiling at my husband’s kisses (this is absolutely NOTHING to do with him) but I’m acting triggered at the moment so it’s time to see a professional and see what can be done with these things that want to come up to the surface after all these years.
I guess I’m saying this on here because I’m so against these things being taboo. I have multiple #metoo stories and it’s time to lift the lid on the box I’ve tried to store them in for so long. They’re escaping whether I want them to or not so some help to process is on the cards for me.
I always thought I lived great as a survivor but at a recent safeguarding meeting for school I realised I still wear all the scars and they affect the way I do things. I don’t want them carrying into the next generation. So for this little one in my arms, for the other three, for my husband and for myself I’m going to get help.

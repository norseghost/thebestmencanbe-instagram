I think this analogy really makes sense of what PTSD and cPTSD really are...anyone who is put in a traumatic enough situation will develop PTSD...why some people do develop PTSD/cPTSD and others donâ€™t to similar trauma is still being worked out, though researcher are beginning to understand more about the brains of people who do develop PTSD and what makes them predisposed as well as the role of resilience...but more work needs to be done.

In order to further research, we need more awareness are PTSD & cPTSD...June is PTSD Awareness Month! Please SHARE to help raise awareness this month.

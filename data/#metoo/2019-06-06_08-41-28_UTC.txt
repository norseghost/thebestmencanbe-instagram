tw: rape ❗️ i‘m a 22 year-old woman. i met a man who used my body for his own pleasure when i was barely the age of 18. i met men who played with my mind to undermine me and feel powerful. i once knew a man who told me that the way i looked i deserved to be raped. i met men who touched me without consent, said horrible things to my face and tried to break me. and every single day i hear men say “not all men”. and guess what? of course it’s “not all men” — but it’s simply too many of them. too many men who somehow think that women are no more than dolls to use for their own entertainment. not a single one of my female friends hasn’t been through situations similar to mine. and if you don’t see a problem with that, you are the goddamn problem. we teach our daughters to be modest, to be kind and to smile. we teach them that walking alone at night is not safe, that they should never leave their drink unattended. we teach them to cover their bodies and to never talk back to a man, especially not if he’s older. and you don’t see a problem with that? honestly? how about we start teaching this: simply don’t fucking rape women. treat them with respect. treat them like the human beings they bloody are. the problem is not within women who embrace their bodies and their minds, the problem is lying within men who think a certain kind of behavior is “asking for it”. newsflash, idiots: not a single one of us is fucking asking for it. we don’t owe you our bodies. we don’t owe you a single goddamn thing. and if you don’t understand this, just fuck off. because we don’t take your shit anymore. we’ve got claws and teeth and if you get too close, i promise you’ll get what you deserve. 🖕🏽

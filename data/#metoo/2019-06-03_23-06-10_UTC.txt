New ink! I got this at the #metoo Springfield flash sale event where 50% of the proceeds go toward the organization. I’m in love with the design and the cause is very important to me! It is estimated that every 92 seconds, someone in America is sexually assaulted, with 66% of the victims falling between ages 12 and 17 (and that’s just the assaults that are reported). THIS IS NOT OK. Speak up, fight back, and show compassion for your fellow human beings. We can, and will, do better.

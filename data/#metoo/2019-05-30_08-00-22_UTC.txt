This is the face of me; an exhausted narc's granddaughter, c-ptsd warrior, hypervigilant insomnia, Palliative care and trauma counsellor and carer, suicidal depression, passionate advocate for mental health and ending the stigma, aspiring writer and occasional untrained sketchy-painty-sculpty-#whateveritscathartic
person, partner, twin sister, superaunt, big sister, lil bit weird occasionally adorable human just trying my f*cking hardest to heal and grow whilst teaching the AI, which is currently learning humans mostly suck😔, that humans can be very good and kind and generous and caring! But we're flawed 'n wounded and need to unlearn all the bad messages we've internalised and trauma you've experienced that wounds you to your very essence. But your essence; your you-ness is AMAZING! You are exactly who you need to be, stop punishing yourself love yourself, give you permission to be! To exist, to grow to heal, to flow to be every single part of you! Do the works tackle those issues, fight those demons, love you take care of you! Fill your cup to overflow so you can share and grow and fill others from your beautiful harvest! Be poetically in love with all of you, all you can and WILL be! You will be exactly who you believe you are! Be the good in this crappy world! Be the absolute best you, truest most authentic you there is! It's your life its your story share it!
📖📚If you ask I will share mine, abusers thrive off endoctrinated shame, when you reject the shame that IS NOT YOURS, you free yourself and can finally have room to heal. Grown adults who abuse children are the ones who should be ashamed not the innocent vulnerable children they groom manipulate torture and confuse. You're unlearning incredibly flawed programming essentially removing a disgusting computer virus from your brain! You are relearning healthier ways, processing painful trauma, rebalancing to a perfect center, the truest you. We will get there, have faith, be brave lil one, you have absolutely got the permission, passion and WILL to heal into yourself, you've GOT this! 🌻🤗🐉🖤#nfiniteheart #t3lesto #mentalhealth #trauma #depression #MeToo #healing #survivornotvictim #fighter #cptsdwarrior

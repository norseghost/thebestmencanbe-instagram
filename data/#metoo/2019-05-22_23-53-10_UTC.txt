Deciding to confide in someone and sharing your story is never easy. The reaction a survivor receives from their support system after disclosing their story has a major impact in how they will cope and in their overall recovery. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If a survivor confides in you, it is important that you provide real and effective support. Do not doubt or place blame on the survivor. Allow survivors to make their own decisions about how to move forward.

Repost and ty @wearefuturefemale (and @thesweetfeminist!) Ever get the â€˜stop over reactingâ€™ response during a discussion you are having that you are either :
.
A) Passionate about or
B) annoyed or angry about.?
.
If humans are encouraged to  repress anger, particularly girls and women, according to clinicians it can manifest into anxiety, depression, and illness because itâ€™s not given free expression. This comes from â€˜Rage Becomes Herâ€™ by Soraya Chemaly, @sorayachemaly scroll across to see the brilliant book Iâ€™m reading. Chemaly reveals how suppressing anger is a trait girls and women are taught to do from an early age. Seemingly passive phrases like stop overacting is a phrase Iâ€™ve heard from men and women and it really annoys me! ðŸ¤¯In fact it makes me so angry I want to punch the person saying it. Has it made me ill? Quite possibly! 
What have you been accused of over reacting to? .

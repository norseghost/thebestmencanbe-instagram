“We know that direct violence causes trauma—we have shelters for it, counselors, services. We know that children who live in violent neighborhoods are more likely to develop PTSD, the daily fear changing their brains and psychological makeup so drastically that flashbacks and disassociation become common. We know people who are bullied get depressed and sometimes commit suicide. Yet despite all these things we know to be true—despite the preponderance of evidence showing the mental and emotional distress people demonstrate in violent and harassing environments—we still have no name for what happens to women living in a culture that hates them.” Blythe Roberson. #stopthewaronwomen #waronwomen #feminism #feminist #equalrights #reproductiverights #rape #sexualassault #survivor #metoo #yellowstone #nationalpark #springtime #nps #takeahike #optoutside

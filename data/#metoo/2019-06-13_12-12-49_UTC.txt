Tuesday night was an epic night in so many respects. It takes Herculean strength to have the courage to stand and speak - and keep on speaking about traumatic events that have destroyed your life, and these 3 women have immeasurable amounts of courage to do just that. Thank you to all who came along in support- I hope that people keep listening and learning from these important stories. I hope that it stands and speaks for all women who have found their strength through surviving these crimes against them, and that it also stands as a permanent reminder to their perpetrators, that the fight for justice will never end.

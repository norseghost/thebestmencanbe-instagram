Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) hadn\u2019t fully hit me yet. \u25ab\ufe0f\n1 in 4 women will experience domestic abuse at some point in their lifetime and 2 women are killed each week in England and Wales by a current or former partner. These were just \u2018stats\u2019 to me until I experienced the horrors of domestic abuse. \u25ab\ufe0f\nMy abuser was charming at first and reeled me in. I experienced sexual abuse, coercive control and domestic abuse - leaving me feeling powerless. He snapped at me for little things. He humiliated me in front of his friends. He told me I wouldn\u2019t amount to much. And he tried to strangle me yet passed it off as \u201cpractising martial arts.\u201d Plus, much more.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nI was lucky in that this relationship came to an end and he hasn\u2019t bothered me since. Yet, many women aren\u2019t. Imagine living with an abuser and having their children and trying to leave the family home but being stalked, harassed and threatened. That\u2019s where @refugecharity come in offering these women and children support and refuge. I want to help women in these situations, that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing a hike for Refuge. \ud83e\udd7e\u26f0\ud83c\udfd5. I\u2019ll be walking the Yorkshire Three Peaks, which involves camping overnight. Anyone that knows me will know that I hate camping \ud83c\udfd5 so this is a really big deal for me! \ud83d\udc9b\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9bPLEASE DONATE (if you can, every little helps) - @justgiving LINK IN BIO \u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0fTHANK YOU \ud83d\udc95 #TeamRefuge #domesticabuse #coercivecontrol #enddomesticabuse #sexualassualt #metoo #yorkshirethreepeaks #yorkshirethreepeakschallenge #charityfundraising #posttraumaticstressdisorder #fundraising #ptsd #trauma #mentalhealth #yourstorymatters #domesticabuseawareness #domesticabusesurvivor #sponsorship #fundraiser #sponsorme #JustGiving #justgivingpage #hikersuk #rambling #charitytuesday #thisgirlcan #domesticviolence #gaslighting #feminist #lovedoesnthurt"

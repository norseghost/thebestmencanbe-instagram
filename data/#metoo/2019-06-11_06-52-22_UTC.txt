Trigger warning; I’m talking about planning a suicide attempt ❤️
.
Hi everyone! I’m sorry for my absence, I have been focusing on myself these past two weeks, to try and climb out of the dark hole I’d dug myself into. I fell into a really dark mindset, and I completely lost my motivation to live. On that Monday I wrote a suicide note to one of my best friends. On Tuesday I gathered up a lot of pills and started to prepare myself, but I couldn’t go through with it. On Wednesday, after talking to one of my friends, I finally managed to find my own strength again, and I called the Swedish version of a suicide hotline. The wonderful guy on the line convinced me to come to the emergency room for an assessment, and I packed a few clothes and took the bus there. You already know the rest of the story, I admitted myself to the psychiatric ward, and I stayed there for two weeks. Today, I can say that was one of the greatest decisions I’ve ever made. I’m really proud of myself for getting there, and I’m proud of myself for not letting my story end. I have a lot more things I want to share with you, but right now, I just want to say I’m so happy you’re still here. Thank you all. ❤️

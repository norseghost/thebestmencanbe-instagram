Senses
Words roll off my tongue - stop!
Fear - what is happening?
Heat - is it getting hot in here?
Heart pounding - panic sets in.
Tears - he's not listening. 
Questions run through my mind - why?
Air hitting my body - I lost, my clothes are off.
Pushing - I can't get him off.
His face - he won't get out of mine. 
His scent - so close I can smell him. 
His touch - his hands on my body. 
Then the senses turn off.

As many of you know, I use journaling as a way to help myself heal. Sometimes I just write, other times I like to pull ideas from others and expand them into my own thoughts. One place I get a few of my journal entries from is @thewordforthis if anyone wants to check them out.

My opinion is that abortion should be a safe, legal process. Other states, such as Missouri and Alabama, are taking extreme routes. So far the SCOTUS has stayed (relatively) far away from the abortion issue, but because of the conservative nature of the justices, our country may be going towards a downward slope. How can we help protect the rights of women? #girlnewsbloggers -

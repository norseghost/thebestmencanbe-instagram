Abuse comes in many forms and not everyone feels able to talk about it. Whether because they fear facing their pain, or how people will treat them because of it, unhealed trauma impacts us in seen and unseen ways, from ptsd, to addictions such as sex, drink and drugs. Our thoughts become distorted and our world becomes confused. We can feel lost, easily lead astray and taken advantage of. Masking, pretending to be ok, hiding behind the over exaggerated behaviour of being happy and trying to make others laugh to avoid feeling your own pain is both exhausting and soul destroying. If you have loved ones you trust, talk to them. Call a help line. Just admitting to yourself you need help is the first and most difficult step to making that change. You are not alone. Too many of us suffer at the hands of abuse. Speak up, speak out. Reclaim your Soul, and your life. You are loved, so very much. #metoo #abuse #sexualassault #rape #domesticviolence #narcissisticabuse #mentalhealthawareness #ptsd #trauma #cptsd #therapy #healing #art #digitalart #loveheals

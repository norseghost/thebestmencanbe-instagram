ğŸ‘‰ "There is a future after abuse. You can get well and do deserve love" ğŸ‘ˆ .Â 
Our #messagesoflove project invites people to write a message to a survivor on a colourful heart. The hearts are pinned to a board in our drop-in where survivors can pick one and take it home as a reminder that they are believed, loved and supported, even by total strangers. ğŸ’› .Â 
If you would like to make and send us a message of love, please do! PM us for our address or find it on our website. ğŸ’œ .Â

â˜•Me tooâ˜•
.
Its amazing how two simple words can change your whole day and your whole perspective. .
Im so guilty of putting on a happy face and just getting shit done. After all, what have I really got to complain about? Well actually, I have abitðŸ¤£. Today was fucken tough, and thats ok, im allowed to complain, im allowed to feel defeated and flat and like ive lost control. .
I even asked my husband "am I a total failure as a mum"? Cos ya know what, today I felt like I was. He walked in to a house full of chaos and tears and he still tells me im a good mum. I dont get it. But maybe im not supposed to. I don't see myself the way he does, or the way my kids do. I see a yelly, hormonal monster, but they just see mum. Because no matter what they do, I still kiss them goodnight and tell them I love them. .
And then I scroll my fb and come across a support page, and see other mums have had a shit day today too. They may not have the same reasons, or the same outcome, but they know how you feel. And a simple "me too" was all it took for me to feel normal again. There was no novel of advice given, no "maybe try this" or "have you thought about this". Just two little words was all I needed to feel like I wasnt alone. I wasnt the only one feeling like I was sinking today. I didnt need to be fixed, I just needed to be heard.

Sometimes hearing advice makes you feel like everyone has brilliant ideas and they have all their shit together, and your the only one whos struggling. But hearing "me too" makes you realise someone else is struggling too, and maybe, just maybe, you can figure out this crazy shit together xxx

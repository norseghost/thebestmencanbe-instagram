#Her30DaysofGratitude | Day 5

I will always be grateful for following my dreams' my passion, what I really wanted to be in my career  path.

I'm grateful I never looked at the down moment' instead I focused on the reason why I chose that path.

Today I'm grateful for the woman of vision I have become.

Thank you Queen @abbykedomina1 for being a part of our #30DayGratitudeChallenge

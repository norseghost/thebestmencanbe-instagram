Happy #socialjusticesaturday to our Yoga community! Today we'd like to call everyone's attention to an amazing resource: the website decolonizingyoga.com! Decolonizing Yoga was created to provide news, resources and support following the efforts to protest a 2013 Yoga Journal Conference held at the Hyatt Hotel in San Francisco. .
Hotel Workers, community organizations and unions had been participating in an ongoing boycott against Hyatt to protest working conditions. On January 18th there was a rally in front of the hotel which included a yoga class in protest of YJ’s conference. A Facebook event was also created named “I Pledge Not to Attend or Teach at the 2014 Yoga Journal Conference if the Boycott Continues.” Over 300 people signed on. The boycott ended when the Hyatt negotiated with the union!

The founder of Decolonizing Yoga, Be Scofield (who we've pictured here), is a queer/trans writer, activist, Dr. King scholar and high level digital strategist who has worked with NYT Best Selling authors. Her work has appeared in Tikkun Magazine, Huffington Post and Alternet and she has a chapter in the book “21st Century Yoga: Culture, Politics & Practice.” As a journalist she has broken numerous stories that exposed abuse, corruption and oppression.
.
The website decolonizingyoga.com is an excellent hub of information as well--there are numerous articles to peruse covering topics from "Queering Tantra: Beyond the Masculine and Feminine" to "Yoga and #metoo: Towards A Culture With Zero Tolerance For Sexual Assault". .
Wow! We love seeing how yogis can use their practice to create meaningful social change, and we are so grateful for folks who are paving the way for the rest of us to follow. Please explore Be Scofield's website and let us know what resonates with you!

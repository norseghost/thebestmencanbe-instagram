With PTSD, the amygdalaâ€˜s scanner gets stuck on alarm mode and often senses danger when there is none actually present. Our brain and nervous system will react regardless because the amygdala has sounded the alarms. This is why the survivor will experience anxiety, irritation, and live on high alert. Itâ€™s not your fault. It is normal. It is your brain trying to protect you. ðŸ§ ðŸš¨#ptsd #ptsdawareness #amygdala #brain #trauma #traumaawareness #supportsurvivors #empowersurvivors #believesurvivors #traumainformed #sexualassault #rape #abuse #resilience #metoo #metoomanyvoices #victim #survivor #education #resource #support #cptsd #courage #mentoo #mentalhealthawareness #themoreyouknow #healing #traumahealing #ptsdrecovery

I've been thinking a bit recently about our physical selves and our physical environments.
-
I'm only going off my own, single, subjective, limited experience here, but I'm pretty sure it's a lot more effective to put your body in situations that counteract your trauma than it is to simply talk about it.
-
That's not to say that talking can't be extremely beneficial, because it definitely can be.
-
Trauma just tends to work in some really weird ways that impact our bodies in ways that our minds don't have access to or don't have words for.
-
Sometimes we just need to experience true safety in order for our trauma to be rewritten.
-
And that's just the beginning.

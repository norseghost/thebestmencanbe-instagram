If you have sex with a person without their consent, it is RAPE.\n. \nSpeaking about consent, here are some few points to note:\n. \n2) If a person gives you their consent as a result of fear of intimidation or hurt, that is NOT consent.\n. \n3) Consent obtained by fraud or deception is NOT consent.\n. \n4) NO MEANS NO. If a person says No and you interprete it as Yes and still go ahead, you are a rapist.\n. \n5) This one might be hard to accept but I was taught this in University. The principle is IF DURING INTERCOURSE A PERSON SAYS STOP, ANY FURTHER PENETRATION IS RAPE. I think the case is R v. Kuti or R v. Kutugi (law students and lawyers please help me out on this one).\n. \n6) If a person was raped and you make a joke out of it,  or you tell them to admit that they enjoyed it, or you ask questions like \"What were you wearing? Why did you go there?\" and all other such ignorant questions, you are part of the problem. You are encouraging a rape culture by silencing victims and helping to embolden perpetrators. . \n7) If you have just been raped, PLEASE DO NOT HAVE YOUR BATH IMMEDIATELY. Go to a GOVERNMENT hospital where you will examined and screened, the results will help you build your case.\n. \n8) When you leave the hospital, go to the Police station to file a formal report. Ask for the FAMILY SUPPORT UNIT there and make your report there.\n. \n9) Here are a list of NGOs and organisations that can help you walk through this and get justice @standtoendrape @mirabelcentreng @dsvrt @warif_ng @jewels_hive @walkagainstrape @shewriteswoman @mentallyawareng.\n. \n10) If you were raped, IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. People rape because THEY ARE RAPISTS!!! NO ONE DESERVES TO BE RAPED.\n. \nP.S: Please drop whatever I may have missed out in the comment section. Feel free to repost, let's get the word out there.\n. \n#Sex #Rape #SexEducation #Consent #SexualAssault #NoMeansNo #Justice #Women #WomensRights #Law #CriminalLaw #KnowYourRights #MeToo #SilenceIsViolence #OliveEmodi"

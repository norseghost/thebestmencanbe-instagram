When you feel anxiety creeping into your body, identify the feeling: “That is anxiety.” To begin to control the emotion, you have to be able to identify it. Then, once you’ve done that, try to identify what’s triggering the emotion. Once you have identified the trigger you are able to prepare yourself for when you know you might encounter it.

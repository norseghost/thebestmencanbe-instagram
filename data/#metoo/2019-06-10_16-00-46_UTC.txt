Fun Fact about me: Growing up, I experienced quite the opposite of this. Girls were constantly gossiping, "friends" would purposely not tell you if there's something in your hair, girls were always perpetuating a mean girl spirit. I started Queen Kong Clothing to spark inclusivity among females, including minorities. I want to encourage NICE GIRL spirit. KIND GIRL SPIRIT. The type of girls that smile at you when you walk by instead of the ones who study your face in effort to pick out your flaws. If I help one person, whether its in confidence, or to convert a "mean girl" into a nice girl, Queen Kong Clothing has done its job.

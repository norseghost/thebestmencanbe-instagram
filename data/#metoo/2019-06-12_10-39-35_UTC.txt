SOMETHING EPIC IS COMING...
.
Sara J. Sanderson and I felt inspired this week to create something that says loud and clear what we see to be true about a gargantuan industry every single one of you is likely familiar with.
.
.
❗️It is estimated to generate over $10 billion a year
❗️It promises to solve issues that only seem to be getting worse.
.
.
We're both a bit, nay, a lot! nervous about this one, sticking our heads above the parapet, perhaps in for a lot of criticism and maybe even a decrease in our audience.
.
.
But we have wanted to say these words for a while, and now it seems they are ready to come out.
.
.
If you're on our mailing list we'll be releasing this TOMORROW and the rest of the world will get it on Friday.
.
.
Sooooo, do you wanna get in there first, or are you pretty good at waiting...?
.
.
Head to the bio to join the mailing list, and while you're waiting oh so patiently ;) enjoy a fabulous freebie on us:
.
.
And we'll see you on the other side...

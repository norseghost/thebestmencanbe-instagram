"I'd spent more than two years investigating the ways that police handle â€” or mishandle â€” sexual assault investigations before #MeToo broke," Doolittle said in a statement to CBC Books. "I thought I had solid opinions on all things related to these issues, but when I actually started to examine the questions that #MeToo was forcing me to ask, the answers weren't always so simple. What I am hoping to do with this book is to bring those important, complicated, uncomfortable, messy conversations into the open."

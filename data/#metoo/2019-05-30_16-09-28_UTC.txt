An unexpected package arrived in the mail yesterday...I was happy to receive this  #humanrights educator kit. Thank you @uofhumanrights. There are so many things each of us can do to help improve this world for ourselves and future generations. Every little bit counts!

Watch for the interview with @ginomckoy and myself coming soon to Poverty Talks on our essay discussing the impact of education and access to technology to disadvantaged communities and families living in poverty.

DAMN...the new anthem for the #metoo movement is in Whisper Network by Chandler Baker. She seriously nails the voice, the anger, the inequity, the conundrums, the rock-and-hard-place choices, the guilt, the lack of clarity, the everything. Oh, and it’s all wrapped up in a mystery with some questionable lead characters but the binding ties of friendship where women look out for each other. ❓❓How many of us have been leered at, been part of that lunch group where awful sexist jokes are told, had to make different clothing choices because of how our boss looks at us, been denied that promotion or that much-wanted spot due to the man needing it because “he has to support his family.” Or how about as a girl growing up, having to put up with boys touching you or assaulting you or bullying you because “boys will be boys?” ...and the list goes on and on and on. 👊🏼Whew, this book really SPOKE to me - can you tell??? Highly highly recommend this one...it’s out on July 2.

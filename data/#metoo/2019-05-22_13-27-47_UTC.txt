“What happened to AIB?”
AIB’s long-awaited update is here.
.
TL;DR
1. AIB’s YouTube channel is, for all intents and purposes, dead for the foreseeable future. They may consider releasing standup clips up the future, but this is not confirmed.
2. “We maintain that Tanmay Bhat’s lapse of judgement regarding Utsav Chakraborty was egregious.” Bhat will no longer hold the position of CEO.
3. An External Committee (EC) was appointed to look into the allegations against Gursimran Khamba in October. However, Khamba stepped away from the process, citing issues with the procedure, and the EC was unable to conclude the investigation on that account. Khamba will no longer be involved in operations at AIB.
4. Rohan Joshi and Ashish Shakya will continue to manage the remaining affairs at AIB, but will also pursue solo interests.

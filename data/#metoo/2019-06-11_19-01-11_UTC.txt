BE IN MY MUSIC VIDEO - #thelonely⠀
⠀
Hi guys I wrote a song last year called ‘The Lonely’ soon to be released that was inspired by a general sense of loneliness in people around me and within myself… being the glass half full kinda gal I am I made music from that moment instead of wallowing in it. ⠀
⠀
We all feel it… in different ways, at different times in our lives. So this is a song about being truthful about how we feel, vulnerable and open which can lead us to greater experiences.⠀
⠀
The overall message in the song is… You’re not alone…⠀
⠀
TO BE IN THIS VIDEO PLEASE SEND THE FOLLOWING⠀

* Your town/country written on the bottom of the sign⠀

* You can be looking down, to the side, straight at the camera. You can look sad, happy, relieved. You can hug someone in your video or photo. You can have your back to the camera or you can wear it loud and proud - anything is ok. Whatever makes you feel good about sharing it.  Just be really thinking about what makes you feel lonely in the moment you capture it.⠀

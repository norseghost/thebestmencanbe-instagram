#breakingnews @rkelly has been charged with 11 new counts of sexual assault and sexual abuse. Scarce details were made public Thursday, but four of the new counts charge Kelly with aggravated criminal sexual assault — a Class X felony that carries six to 30 years in prison on conviction. 
Three of the new counts accuse him of sexually abusing a victim between the ages of 13 and 16. It was unclear if this is a new victim or one of the four victims — three of them underage at the time — whom Kelly was charged in February with sexually abusing.

Kelly was charged at that time with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving those four victims.

As you know this case with R. Kelly has caused a constant uproar in the black community. ———————————————————————— #rkelly #SurvivingRKelly #muterkelly #rkellycharged #metoo #sexualabuse #sexualassault #predator #criminalcharges #lockrkellyup #trending #trendingnews #thetrendingplug

                        "text": "USS Liberty:\nThe USS Liberty was an American Navy ship that was attacked by Israeli torpedoes and jet fire on june 8, 1967 in the Mediterranean Sea. For those of you that are unaware, the 6-day war was fought between Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Israel from June 5th to June 10 and the Mediterranean Sea is right between Israel and Egypt. \nIn the days leading up to the attack on the USS Liberty Israel warned the US that all ships would be considered hostile, this was because Israel was in a fragile state due to the 3 wars prior and the lack of money/resources.\nBefore the attack the IDF has falsely recieved word that El-Arish was under a Naval Attack. After recieving this information the IDF has released 3 torpedo ships to investigate the attack, they found one unidentified vessel(USS Liberty) and called in the location to the Israeli Air Force. 4 fighter jets were released and opened fire on the USS Liberty with 30 mm rounds as well as missiles, afterwards the Torpedo ships released several torpedoes and killed 34 seamen, 171 were injured and the ship has nearly sank. After the attack Israel sent a few jets for reconnaissance and returned with the information that the Vessel was infact a ship belonging to the US Navy. \nAfter the incident, from 1968-1969 Israel has payed ~7 million(48.5 million today) to the US government to go as compensation to the families of the injured/dead. And in 1980 Israel gave 6 more million(~18.2 million) to the government as compensation for the incident.\nTheir are some conspiracy theories as to why Israel attacked the USS Liberty, but there is no substantial evidence for any of them due to us still not knowing the true purpose as to why the Vessel was there in the first place.\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\n#shallnotbeinfringed #pallywood #idf #hamas #women #feminism #gun #god #peace #liberty #libertarian #undocumented #illegal #meme #america #trump #democrat #fakenews #lgbt #liberal #conservative #censored #freedom #metoo #constitution #assaultrifle #ar15 #bluewave #redwave \n#fightforpapadixie right now and forever.\n-------------- Follow my partners:\n-\n@daily_conservative_news_\n-\n@papa_dixie\n-\n@conservate_"

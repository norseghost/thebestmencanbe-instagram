Once again I am so sorry for the long absence my life is crazy but I’m going to try to get back to posting regularly. You want to know who an inspirational woman is? It is @rachelminersgram she has MS but she doesn’t let it define who she is. I have met her and she is such a bright light in this world. She takes this struggle she fights everyday and turns it into something good, she finds ways to inspire all of us and do good in the world. She is so sweet and so genuine and I truly hope I get the opportunity to meet her again and talk to her. She is a beautiful soul and she is such an inspiration to me. She does so much good and yet everyday she struggles more than most of us could ever know. Comment below who your inspiration is and if you feel like it a quote by them. We could all use a little positivity. #metoo #metoomovement #timesup

"Hvað kynvillingur hefur haft svona slæman smekk?" ("Which faggot had such bad taste?") Acrylic on canvas 2019, 160x120cm. The most personal painting of my current exhibit, a show that is inspired by #metoo. The title is the question a fellow writer threw at me after I came out of the closet in 2015 with the sexual abuse I had suffered some 30 years earlier. The show closes this Saturday. #hallgrimurhelgason #artist #artistandwriter #contemporaryartist #contemporarypainting #figurative #acrylicpainting #metooart #feministart #tveirhrafnarlisthus #icelandicart #icelandicartist #icelandicpainting #galleries #modernart #artoftheday #artnetinstagram #artxeurope #artforum

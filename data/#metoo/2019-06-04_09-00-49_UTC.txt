“I wasn’t aware of my rape until I was told there was CCTV evidence of it, and that I could prosecute if I wanted to. We were friends, we had lots of friends in common too, we’d been out before, I thought I was safe. He bought me tequila shots all night. He ruined my life, but I didn’t think it was worth ruining his, so I didn’t report it. I wish I had. I watched him spend the next year hanging out with all our friends, as I withdrew into myself, lost all my friends, and nearly failed out of uni.”

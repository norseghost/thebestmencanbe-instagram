Vasectomies are completely safe, one-time, virtually painless, have zero side effects, and are completely reversible. If they really wanted to end abortions, seems like that would be the best course of action, right? After all, no one’s ever gotten pregnant without sperm. (Obviously, WE do not believe in the interference with anyone’s bodily autonomy—but the point stands that if abortion was REALLY what they cared about, they’d make vasectomies mandatory, or at least impose a tax on those who didn’t have one.) It’s not like THEY have a moral problem with legislating bodies.

Ah, I see—that involves *not* manipulating the bodies of marginalized populations to keep them in a cycle of poverty and control. So nah, wouldn’t achieve the goal of abortion bans. *mic drop* 🙅‍♀️ .

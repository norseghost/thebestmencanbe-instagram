You've all seen my posts on gardening, zero waste, plastic pollution, art etc. I've never spoken out about other things that concern me: violence towards women, LGBTQ people and ethnic minorities, racial profiling, bigotry and racism. We can't close our eyes to the changes in recent years to the rise in violence, bigotry. I know that I'm speaking from a place of privilege, being a 50 year cis het white woman in the Netherlands, living far from the major cities. My demographic needs to stay active and fight for what's right. It's not someone else's battle. Were all in this together.

I read about this Health and Labour Minister in Japan. This dinosaur wants to make high heels mandatory for women in the workplace. 
You know: high heels fake the posture of a woman showing interest in a future mate. So what does that say about a man demanding women to wear high heels? 
In my mind it's clearly a need to dominate and a need to see (artificially) sexually receptive women around them. To demean the innate worth of a woman by placing their aesthetics above everything else.
I would be very hesitant to get close to such a  man and be very wary of their nature. It's scary when they are in positions of power.

Essentially Shaft is a ‘black’ film, and surprisingly a bit ‘old school’ for the #metoo generation, as Samuel Jackson is as usual rather winning as Shaft.  The ‘run down’ is that Shaft (originally Richard Roundtree, who shows up later) has a son Junior Shaft one would suppose.  He’s an FBI employee and is somewhat ‘square’ compared to Jackson’s Shaft who hasn’t seen his son in 20 years.  When the young man meets his dad again, to enlist him in the mysterious death of a friend, our hero Shaft is singing the virtues of the more sexual aspects of a woman’s persona.  Jackson is from another era and is aware of the revisionist culture storm that surrounds an older black man of his note.  He won’t go down without a fight.  There are some laughs in this, although you could feel some of the more cautious members of an audience button up at such antics!  Jackson’s familiar voice and tenor are pretty much this entire production, and for the most part it works.  Black culture from way back seems to have never left Shaft, he’s certainly tough, but this is a tongue in cheek production mostly, light and relaxed, shootings and fights are certainly skimping on reality when it’s Shaft’s turn to shoot.  The bullet always seems to hit the mark!  By the time legendary Richard Roundtree shows up it’s any wonder it took quite a long time to get to him.  The three Shafts essentially give the bad guys the Shaft.  Only that the story here doesn’t feel all that essential to the film, Shaft Jr.’s best buddy dead of an OD feels rather distant and unimportant by films end. 
6.5 Out Of 10

If you know ‘the hood’ as they say, you might find Shaft to your liking, if you like Samuel Jackson this film is one you won’t want to miss.  Mr. Jackson’s winning enough as it is, and Shaft just may have more to say in our future, as the three Shafts: Roundtree, Jackson and Junior may be the start of a new and beautiful friendship.

We’re so excited to announce OWV’s 3rd annual fundraising open mic event: BREAKING THE SILENCE. A conversation on oppression and violence against women in Toronto! June 21st is National Indigeous Day and to celebrate we’re having an indigenous storytelling circle featuring some of the best Indigenous women indentifying artists in the city.
Every year OWV holds a fundraiser to financially support woman identifying artists for our annual Summer event, coming up July! All proceeds go to local woman identifying artists. If you can‘t make our event, feel free to support and donate using the eventbrite link in bio!

The panel will feature all OWV members for our Conversations with OWV Series And the discussion will be centred around experiences with oppression and violence, specifically in the city and the lack of and/or accessible resources available for women.
We will be closing with an open mic for women identifying folk and femmes! open mic signs up get discounted tickets! Message or email us to sign up! ❤️
Looking forward to seeing you all there, Limited tickets in our bio now 🥳🥳🥳🥳❤️❤️❤️❤️ #ourwomensvoices

But the way you face and handle their cruelty says a lot about you. Isn\u2019t it scary how people can judge easily about something they don\u2019t really know? How they can react instantly without thinking? How, even if they know how good the person is, they can still change their minds?\nI guess the old saying \u201cKindness is a chain reaction\u201d doesn\u2019t apply anymore in this century. I can\u2019t count on my fingers the number of people who made me realizes that no matter how kind you are to them, they can still turn their backs on you and betray you just because of rumors and hearsay.Hearing rumors about me made me depressed before but when I started to understand and accept the fact that I can\u2019t please everyone, everything changed. It\u2019s all in the mind. It\u2019s all in your perspective.They are the people worth keeping. They are the people you will need. When people throw you rocks so you will stop from shining, kill them with kindness. Kill them in silence. Not reacting on everything they say about you doesn\u2019t mean weakness but rather it shows intelligence and strength. It means you are smart enough to ignore things that will not help you grow.\nWhile people are busy making rumors, become busy too in making yourself the best version you can be. By the end of the day, they will get nothing in return but waste of their time. By the end of the day, you\u2019re the real MVP for proving them wrong. By the end of the day, you\u2019re the happy one and that\u2019s what really matters.\nAdopt everything that will help you grow and develop, release everything that will stop you from being the person He plans you to be. You\u2019re a work of art. You are unique. Don\u2019t let people change that. ***\nModel:@boity\n#success #inspiration #positivevibes #metoo #motivation #womanpower #life #metoo #art #feminist #feminism #successfulwomen #motivation #slayqueen #melaninpoppin #blackwomen\u00a0 #bhfyp #humanrights #girlpower #womensrights #intersectionalfeminism #equalrights #lgbt #women #transgender #gay #lgbtq #womenempowerment"

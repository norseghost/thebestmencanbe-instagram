ðŸ‘™ #mybodymyRules - new song: BURNT BRA --- 15 years ago, I stopped wearing bras at age 22.  At 24,  I removed myself from the patriarchal religious community of my youth, and started unraveling the mind-funk stemming from decades of conforming to bodily restriction and regulation enforced by conservative leadership.  My daughter is now 10 and I am 37.  It is a time of great political / feminine unrest, and no easy task raising a pre-pubescent human with healthy confidence and autonomy over her (#interracial) body.  I am still learning these things myself (boundaries / self-love / body confidence) and so is my Asian mother who comes from a country where women are traditionally, deeply subservient to men and cling to Eurocentric beauty standards... with loads of historical, ancestral trauma to unpack and heal from.  Some may not understand what I'm expressing here,  but if you do,  then you really do.  Dear Humans -- May we allow each other our intrinsic freedoms. ðŸ’›  Sending compassion to all of you, whether we agree or not. #reproductiverights #parenting #intersectionality

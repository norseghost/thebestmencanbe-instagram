Sometimes a break from reality is needed. The ocean always gives me the feeling of freedom and peace. ❤ 
Mental health awareness is so important. What you see on the outside might be so different than the inside. Even if someone seems perfect, they might be in suffering emotionally and mentally. Be kind to others. We all deserve happiness. Live your life with love. 💋💕 .

Soooo fed up with the bullshit of the personal development industry…
.
There you go I’ve said it…
.
The industry I love, the one I work in…
.
The one that changed my life!!!
.
Can be so full of rubbish its unreal.
.
I am so fed up seeing book after book, article after article, podcast after podcast… (ok you get my point!!! ) … telling people to go out there and make it happen.

And please don’t get me started on how to guides…
.
10 steps to earning ….. blah blah…
.
Listen, I know a lot of amazing people doing some pretty amazing things, I’m not saying its not possible but what I’m fed up is with people selling the bullshit version to people who want a lifeline.

The version where they leave out the pain, the battles, the struggles and just put out the version that all you need to do is skip down the road following the numbers 1-10 and you will hit the gold pot of success.

Now, im all for modelling successful people, looking at what they do, implementing their strategies so I can move forward.

This isn’t what this is about…. This is about selling a fantasy, to the people who want to believe it but lack the confidence to make it happen.

You can level up, you can go on all the courses, you can read all the books…
.
But, guess what?

If you don’t believe you have what it takes...
.
If you cant be really honest about whats holding you back….
.
Then you are wasting your time.

You cant buy self confidence… you have to build it!! You have to do the things you don’t want to do and keep doing them.

Don’t be afraid to start where you are at… to be really honest about not only your skills but also your fears…
.
This is why I work with confidence and self belief… because it doesn’t matter what skills you have, if you don’t believe you can… you simply wont!

No matter how many books you read!

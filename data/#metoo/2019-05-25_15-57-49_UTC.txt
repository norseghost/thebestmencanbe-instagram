2018/2019 the Energy for Bill Cosby was extreme guilty guilty guilty that’s what everyone said even when they heard the case and most knew those #metoo women was lying. So now u have #harveyweinstein which I told y’all was gon go unscathed and now it comes out he touched Lupita and many many other women who are still in the industry today. Weinstein payed a 44 million dollar settlement and nobody saying shit, I said no one would say anything because he isn’t black there are different laws for people of color and as u can see money do not matter, cause Bill Cosby money is long too. But when you got Oprah (Weinstein’s good friend) throwing shade at MJ and u put R Kelly out there too switch narrative our people have short term memory loss, they only go hard against they own and we are the ONLY people that will throw each other under the bus it’s called “ Being on Code” all walks of life in society use this expect the majority of us. Hence forth Weinstein gets to sleep at home and Bill Cosby who was set up ( cause he wanted to purchase NBC, he still a coon tho) gets his negro wake up call. If you do your research you will find it all too be facts not an opinion. But I digress.

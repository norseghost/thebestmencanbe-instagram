When I say that Gary was “my person” I truly mean that. He was my safe place. For the first time in my life I had found someone to be truly vulnerable with. This vulnerability gave us the “ability” to grow a beautiful, deep, relationship. .
.
When we got serious and were considering marriage I knew I had to tell him what had been hiding in the deepest parts of me. .
I remember crying as I told him that as a child I had been abused for a couple of years. And as a teenager there was an “incident” that left me so deeply wounded.
.
He lovingly said, “you realize that none of that was your fault right?” It was like a lightbulb went off. For years I had subconsciously thought it WAS my fault. I carried guilt without even knowing it. .
.
I share because Gary was an instrumental part in my healing from the trauma of my childhood. He was the bandage that helped secure and heal my wounds. He wrapped me so tightly in his love that I felt put back together. .
.
When he died it was like those bandages were stripped from my body. Not only was I left with gaping wounds from his death but all of the old wounds were ripped open again. .
.
In one of my first therapy sessions he asked me who I was. He wanted to get to know me. I spewed all of the hurt I had gone through: my parent’s divorce, abuse, death. He replied that those are things that all happened TO me, but they aren’t ME. .
.
What he sees is an individual, that despite being critically wounded as a child, was able to build a beautiful life with a loving partner. He is confident that I have the strength to do it again.
.
.
So here I find myself. Severely wounded and broken. It’s my job to pick up these broken pieces and create a different beautiful life. For me, for my kids and for Gare. .

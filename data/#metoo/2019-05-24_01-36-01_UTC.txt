#metoo is absolutely for men too! it's a movement made for everyone and i want everyone that follows me to know that. men are abused too. men are raped too. it may tend to happen more to women (or at least we hear about it more) but that shouldn't erase the fact that anyone can be abused/harassed/raped, as well as anyone can be the abuser. •

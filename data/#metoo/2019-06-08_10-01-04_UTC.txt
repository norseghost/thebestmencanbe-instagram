“Having met survivors of these crimes, I am always humbled by their strength and drive to prevent it happening to others. Theirs are among some of the hardest lives to live, with memories and daily living legacies of the dark acts against them, and yet they stand to tell their stories and relive them as a gift to others so that others might not know their personal hell. If there is a positive I hope that it triggers a tougher stance against those who commit these crimes, and governments who protect them, and that there is further change in society to wipe out stigma that faces the victims, and leaves no room for acceptance or excuse for the idea that sexual violence is a normal part of conflict in any way shape or form.” - @rebeccahawkinssculpture 'Mother and Child' is the commemorative artwork for the Lai Dai Han, being created by sculpture artist, Rebecca Hawkins.

From Wednesday 12th June, the sculpture will be available to view, along with an exhibition on the Vietnam War and the Lai Dai Han, at the gallery at 10 Hanover Street in central London. Following that, the sculpture will be displayed outdoors at a central London location to be announced in due course. .

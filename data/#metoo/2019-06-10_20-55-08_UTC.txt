bar begov presents cocktail Mary ❤

Sometimes things just happen, weather you want them, or not. A while back I met a person that became very dear to me. She inspired me to make that cocktail, which i named after her. She came at the bar and ordered mastika, which no one usually orders. From that moment I knew there was something special about her. Was it the crazy ideas that she has or her beautiful smile, I don’t know, but I was drawn to her. Just like her, the Mary is crazy and unexpected, but undoubtedly delightful.

A brief article from @nytimes and a sobering reminder of ways women’s contributions to the advancement of society often go unrecognized or are attributed solely to their male colleagues. 😤

I see this happening in the workplace in large and small ways ALL THE TIME, (a more contemporary example with great commentary here:

Calling it out risks violating social norms, losing allies and seeming shrill.  When will working women have a #metoo moment and feel safe in numbers to not cede our career trajectories, potential impact on the world, and economic security?  When do we say, en masse, #thisisbullshit and challenge a status quo that erases the contributions of women and marginalized people for the benefit of who exactly?  Not even the men in the two articles I cited felt comfortable taking all the credit.

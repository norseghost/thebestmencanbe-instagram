Poem.  GROW UP GIRL
“The biggest tragedy Has been for me To learn not to trust. A thousand chasing thoughts touch my lips And bite the dust. I must! I must learn Not to  trust. Not to trust how safe I feel with you; Your words, your smile...It’s manipulation; Nothing new. I must learn Not to trust! I am loved For how I look, And not for me. I am trying hard to be. Closed up. Not free. Not me. I am told that’s maturity.”#mrinaliniwritelight#metoo#womanpower#poem#bookstagram #creativewriting#psychology#womanpower #romance#soulmate

We were fighting to fit in an ocean with a current pushing against us. Trying to appease an industry that doesn\u2019t want us to be ourselves. That makes us feel shameful for who we are. Stereotyping us into characters they create and in a box we can\u2019t break out of. \nHow do you stand out when they want you to look the same? How do you stand out when they don\u2019t like the way you look? You have to live your life as plain as can be until someone says: I choose you! \nHow do you get back up when you get thrown into constant rejections?\nWhen Maissa is too white to play an Arab but too Arab to play a white person. When Blakely is too tattooed to be viewed as wholesome, or he is too bald to be the good guy next door. When Jesse sounds too gay to play a \u201cregular\u201d male role, or Kelsey is too brown to be considered a lead in Mid-Western American film and Julie has to compete with every brunette in her age range. \nDon\u2019t be too sexual, don\u2019t be too gay, don\u2019t be too pretty, don\u2019t be too ethnic, don\u2019t be too Arab...\nWell, f*ck it. \nLet\u2019s make a show with all these characters. With strong females, with gay men, with Arab Muslims, with unapologetic sexual content including fetish and kink. Let\u2019s put a Muslim Arab woman in the same scene as sex toys - something unheard of! Let\u2019s put men spanking each other, let\u2019s talk real #metoo experiences! Let\u2019s choose diversity and inclusion. Let\u2019s choose sex positivity. Let\u2019s showcase an audience that always feels left out. Let\u2019s change the narrative. That\u2019s how the little idea of what Dirty Love came to be for what it is today. \nThe indie film movement is making a comeback and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make a change in the Hollywood film industry. Change is coming and we are going to be part of it. \nThank you to everyone who has supported us! \u270c\ud83c\udffc\n\ud83d\udcf8: @lookslikepolaroid\nDress: @cantasfashion \nHair/makeup: @voilacoiffureottawa \nSuit: @simonshomme"

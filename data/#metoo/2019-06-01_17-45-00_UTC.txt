McKenna Morbelli, of New Rochelle, traveled to the clinic last week to have a late-term abortion 33 weeks into her pregnancy after it became apparent that her fetus had developed abnormalities.

Following a complex multi-day procedure, the 29-year-old married woman allegedly suffered a ruptured uterus and passed away from massive internal bleeding in a nearby hospital.

Maryland currently allows clinics to perform late-term abortions in cases where the fetus develops an abnormality. In contrast, New York law allows such abortions only when the mother's health or life is in danger.

Amid growing pressure from conservative groups that have seized on the woman's death to raise awareness about the purported dangers associated with late-term abortions, the Maryland Office of Health Care Quality and the Montgomery County Police Department both launched investigations into the incident,The Washington Post reported.

The circumstances surrounding the death remain unclear, along with the exact nature of the baby's abnormalities.

The Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has performed an autopsy on Morbelli’s body, but officials say a complete review could take more than a month. ‘It is so tragic that this family had to lose not only their nearly full-term child, but also their wife, daughter, and sister,’ said Michael Martelli, executive director of the Maryland Coalition for Life, according to the Catholic News Agency.

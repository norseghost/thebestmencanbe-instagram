Beyond the post-it, we started to write down our protests on huge posters in the campus.
The letters started with "I want to attend the class", " I just mistook it" " Do you remember the summer", "I sue the Constitutional monarchy which ruins our student council" 
Especially our proud Class of 2007 , graduatuated industrial design drew this wonderful piece in 33℃ Seoul, today. 
Smelling the scent of rose, we will rose gorgeously. 
We won't stop till you apologize.

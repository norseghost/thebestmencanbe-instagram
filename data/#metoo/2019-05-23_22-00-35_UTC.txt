If you live somewhere with a representative who will defend your rights, then PLEASE, for all of us here in Alabama, ask them to support the #WomensHealthProtectionAct. Our state lawmakers have proven that they will do anything they can to restrict our access to abortion. You can help. #StopTheBans

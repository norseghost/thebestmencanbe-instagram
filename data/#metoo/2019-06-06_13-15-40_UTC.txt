Armies, rebel groups and terrorist organisations worldwide use rape as a tactic of warfare. Large-scale sexual violence has happened in the past and continues with devastating consequences for millions of victims and their communities in the Former Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Congo. It was a true honor to meet #denismukwege Nobel Peace Prize Laureate 2018. The Dr. who has dedicated his life to end rape for women and men as a weapon of war worldwide.

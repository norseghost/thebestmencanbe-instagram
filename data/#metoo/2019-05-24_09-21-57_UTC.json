                        "text": "- Bannon got it immediately. He believes in the whole Andrew Breitbart doctrine that politics is downstream from culture, so to change politics you need to change culture. And fashion trends are a useful proxy for that. Trump is like a pair of Uggs, or Crocs, basically. So how do you get from people thinking \u2018Ugh. Totally ugly\u2019 to the moment when everyone is wearing them? That was the inflection point he was looking for.\n\nIs what Cambridge Analytica does akin to bullying? - I think it\u2019s worse than bullying, Christopher Wylie says. - Because people don\u2019t necessarily know it\u2019s being done to them. At least bullying respects the agency of people because they know. So it\u2019s worse, because if you do not respect the agency of people, anything that you\u2019re doing after that point is not conducive to a democracy. And fundamentally, information warfare is not conducive to democracy.\n\nMillions of people\u2019s personal information was stolen and used to target them in ways they wouldn\u2019t have seen, and couldn\u2019t have known about, by a mercenary outfit, Cambridge Analytica, who, Wylie says, \u201cwould work for anyone\u201d. Who would pitch to Russian oil companies. Would they subvert elections abroad on behalf of foreign governments?\n\nIt occurs to me to ask Wylie this one night. - Yes.\n\nNato or non-Nato? - Either. I mean they\u2019re mercenaries. They\u2019ll work for pretty much anyone who pays.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible revelation. It also encapsulates all of the problems of outsourcing \u2013 at a global scale, with added cyberweapons. And in the middle of it all are the public \u2013 our intimate family connections, our \u201clikes\u201d, our crumbs of personal data, all sucked into a swirling black hole that\u2019s expanding and growing and is now owned by a politically motivated billionaire.\n\nCarole Cadwalladr\nThe Guardian\n\n#marketing #trending #profit #political #success #collective #ootd #politics #trending #metoo #timesup #trend #strategy #feminism #finnishgirl #freedom #graphics #future #lifestyle #journalist #journalism #psychology #god #fashion #trendy #hygge #blogger #influencer #business #lgbt #concept"

If I could go back and tell my younger self one thing? It'd probably be that life is a series of ups and downs, the ounches thrown are meant to make you stronger, look that asshole in the eyes and stand your ground, stand up for who you are and what you believe in, itll be okay! Even if the ones you thought would be there forever end up leaving, youll always have you so treat yourself with kindness and keep your head up ðŸ’›

Lauren’s May Roundup! 💫⁣
⁣
•The Orphanage of Gods - 3🌟’s - loved the premise but the ending was really rushed and I thought some of the writing was weak.⁣
⁣
•The Bride Test - 4🌟’s - as a huge fan of The Kiss Quotient I was excited for this and it certainly didn’t disappoint!⁣
⁣
•Vicious - 4🌟’s - the whole what makes a hero and what makes a villain and the grey area of it all within this book made this a very good read! ⁣
⁣
•Aurora Rising - 5🌟’s - I NEED TO BE IN SQUAD 312 - I adore them all but Fin, Cat and Scarlett were standout characters for me and I’m still coping with the ending 🙈 - so excited for the next one
⁣
•Wicked Saints - 3🌟’s - more like 3.5 to be honest - it was a good set up, I didn’t see the plot twists coming but it seemed to drag for too long before rushing the action but looking forward to where it goes next ⁣
⁣
•Top Secret - 4🌟’s - I really enjoyed this book, some of the scenes truly were 🔥 and I loved the contrast in characters but that it made them work! Some brilliant one liners included! ⁣
⁣
•The Dream Thieves - 4🌟’s⁣
•Blue Lily, Lily Blue - 3🌟’s⁣
•The Raven King - 4🌟’s⁣
- I struggled to see the hype of this series in book one so much I waited ages to continue, I fell in love with Ronan in book two but still struggled, book three felt weaker than book two to me but is that because I loved the focus on Ronan’s arc? Maybe. But after reading The Raven King and looking back on the series as a whole - I completely understand the hype of the series, it was amazing⁣
⁣
•Half Bad - 3🌟’s - Interesting premise but it seemed to take a while to get off the ground and running ⁣
⁣
•The Alchemist - 2🌟’s - the message this story sends out, I don’t believe which is probably why I didn’t like it ⁣
⁣
•The Nowhere Girls - 4🌟’s - I cried because of the reality this book addresses in terms of #MeToo and ‘boys will be boys’, the message it sends at the end is important and I really adored the book. ⁣
⁣
Reread - ⁣
⁣
Six of Crows - 5🌟’s - I LOVE MY GANG ⁣

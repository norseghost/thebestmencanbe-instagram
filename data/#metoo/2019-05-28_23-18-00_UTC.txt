Things that struck alight the fire of passion in my heart today. Some photographed. Some not. Others remembered:

1) These shoes!! Oooft!!! An immediate no brainer purchase from Sue Ryder (charity shop). Obviously my size before I even looked. Only £5. The only thing is, as some of you may be aware of, I can't wear heels!! However, I have a plan. It's been a rolling around in my mind for a few years now. To 'pimp' up the walking stick I have with flowers and magical-ness (a la #fridakahlo x), or, acquire a dashingly sexy cane. So I can then walk in these (and, ahem, the other fine pairs of) heeled beauties 😀 However, I digress. Passion 1. Logic 0 😂

2) Fresh asparagus. Ripe perfect avocado. Bulbous fat garlic. A simple dinner a la Liz from 'Eat Pray Love' (movie), as noted (and remembered) from her time in her Italian apartment 😊. So delicious. Passion made me eat mindfully. Lots of 'mmmmmm' sounds ensued! Passion 1. Mind 0 😘

3) An evening at my dear friends' event, 'The Sex Lectures'. Passionate folk talking about and sharing heartfully, humorously and hopefully on pleasure, #metoo, orgasm, relationships and fetish. Living on purpose. Living in juiciness. Passion 1. Boredom 0 ☺

4) A darling dearest soul sister. Heart to heart. Laughter. Friendship. Truth. Beauty. Love 💖

5) Remembering my trip to Argentina, 10 years ago. I went on what I called a 'passion' trip, after 3 years of learning tango, and the first time, in my years of travel, not travelling East into hippy lands. 3 months of finding the milonga in each town, village or city. I'd forgotten. I shared of how some of my most amazing and beautiful memories were of hanging out at these tango halls, knowing no Spanish, with noone speaking English, dancing, sharing food, and united by our passion for the dance xxx

Passion is everywhere. It just requires our saying yes to it in appreciation ❤

Aho ❤

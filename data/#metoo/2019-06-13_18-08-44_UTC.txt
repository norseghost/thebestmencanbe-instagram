Last night was AHMAZING. Ilana Glazer’s comedy show was hilarious and she talked about so many important issues like climate change, problems with our current administration, the rise in Nazism, the #metoo and Time’s Up movements, and homophobia. I didn’t know this was possible, but I am even more in love with her than I was before #theplanetisburning

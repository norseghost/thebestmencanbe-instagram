how cute is my new neighborhood? this weather is perfect for evening walks. 
it's a beautiful thing to have lungs that allow you to breathe air and legs that allow you to climb mountains, and it's a shame that sometimes we don't realize that that’s enough. i’d love to see more people appreciating what it is to have a body that works for you (and sometimes doesn’t work for you) and the beauty that is just being. being here, being alive, being you. health isn’t just about what you’re eating, it’s also about what you’re thinking and saying. you will never speak to anyone more than you speak to yourself in your head so please remember to be kind and gentle with yourself. 🌿🍃🌱

You always have a choice. ⠀
⠀
It is your choice to say "no thank you" or "yes please" to hands-on assists in class. At any time. No explanation neccessary.⠀
⠀
And to help with communicating, we have these beautiful wooden tokens at seeker+kind from @drlaurentober as part of her project @mentalhealthawareyoga 😍🙏🏼⠀
⠀
Have you used them? How did it feel? Would you recommend them to other studios and teachers? xx⠀

3. The number of times I've heard #EveEnsler, one of my #sheroes speak publicly and fill my veins with motivation to follow in her footsteps.
2. The number of conversations I've been lucky to have with Eve, as well as the number of signed books I proudly own in my collection.
1. My one hope is that everyone reads her latest book, @theapology and begins a dialogue with their friends and loved ones about sexual abuse and well, sex in general. 
Who knows? Maybe one less girl will have to say #metoo and yearn for #theapology for the rest of her life.

PS. Eve's works should be required readings in #highschool

Sheâ€™s a beautiful piece of broken pottery, put back together by her own hands. And a critical world judges her cracks while missing the beauty of how she made herself whole again. 
It is ok to have bad days, to make mistakes, to sometimes hide from the world, to be less than perfect. 
You need to do whatâ€™s best for you, take care of yourself (no one will do it for you), thatâ€™s not selfish, it doesnâ€™t mean #mefirst it means #metoo. You are worth it. You deserve to be happy, to feel good. Do things for yourself. 
Remember life is good and with God is oh so beautiful.

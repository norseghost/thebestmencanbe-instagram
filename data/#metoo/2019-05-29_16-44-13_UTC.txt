‼️SADAF KANWAL IS CANCELED! ‼️😒🙅🏽⁣
⁣
Another day, another celebrity foot in mouth situation. Case in point : Sadaf Kanwal being under fire for openly body shaming! ⁣
⁣
The outrage sparked after Sadaf Kanwal uploaded a picture of model @alyzehgabol on a her #snapchat where Gabol is holding up her cell phone with a picture of a seemingly over-weight woman. Kanwal captioned the image as “future”, implying that Gabol could look like that woman in the future. ⁣
⁣
We're honestly appalled at the fact that people like Sadaf don't even process their own thoughts before saying it out loud. Why can't they take note of the fact that the society is moving towards being accepting and such insensitive remarks can affect and hurt anyone! ⁣
⁣
We for one aren't surprised as this isn’t the first time that @sadafkanwal has put her 'intellect ' on display. Last year, she questioned the intentions of #MeToo victims. When she said that if a woman is harassed she should say it then. Why are you remembering it later? #disgust ⁣

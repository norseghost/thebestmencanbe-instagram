May is mental health awareness month. I wouldn’t feel right not sharing a little more about my mental health with you all. I feel a lot of pressure to be ok and to come across as ok because I share so much about mental health and recovery on my page. But, just because I share so much about mental health doesn’t mean that I’ve told you guys everything.
 Yes, I’ve made huge strides in my mental health and I have overcome a lot. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t still suffer from depression and anxiety. I do. It does not just go away.  And that is ok. Everyday I am learning more about my personal mental health. What my triggers are, when I’m genuinely happy and when I’m not. There has been a lot of change in my life lately. Change that is uncertain and scary. I have had to learn to be open and honest with people in my life about when I am not okay. I have had to let myself breakdown in order to hopefully have a breakthrough. 
I have spent so many of my days and so much of my time making sure that everyone around me is okay and taken care of. Even if I wasn’t. It is who I am. However, I would like to add taking care of myself to that. Learning to say no, taking time for myself, asking for help when I need it and talking to myself how I talk to everyone else around me. 
I’ve been made to feel crazy and unworthy because of things I cannot control. I don’t want others feeling that way. I’ve felt like I’ve had no one and had no purpose in this world. Sometimes I still find myself wondering. I’ve had people
Come into my life though who have shown me love, understanding and support. And if I can be SOMEONE for anyone. I want to be. I’m not perfect and I can’t be perfect. All I can be is me. •

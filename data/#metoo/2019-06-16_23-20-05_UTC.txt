Dear little girls, one day the world will hit you so hard you will lose your spark. It’s going to hurt but when you get back up, make sure you rise as the 🔥 whole 🔥damn 🔥fire!

Had the pleasure of filming the fierce women of Santiago and, my goodness, did they have some words for the world. We climbed on top of a bus stop to get a better view because the streets were flooded with women AND their families! We learned the women of Santiago were encouraged by the #metoo movement in America. 
Dear America, #theworldiswatching .

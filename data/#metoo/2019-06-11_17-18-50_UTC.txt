Salt N Pepa are an American hiphop girl-group, formed in 1985.
Group members: Salt (Cheryl James), Pepa (Sandra Denton) and DJ Spinderella (Deidra Roper).
They were signed  to Next Plateau Records and released their single "Push it" on March 8 1987.
For our project I used the song "Lets talk about sex" and added the word "consent". Which is unfortunately still relevant in these metoo times.

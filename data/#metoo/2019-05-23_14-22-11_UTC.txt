Gooood morning everyone! Just a little update on our shop! So there’s good news and bad news. The bad news is, unfortunately things like this happen all the time and there’s nothing we can do about our name being plagiarized on Amazon because we don’t have the means to get it trademarked. The GOOD news is, this is obviously a form of flattery and means we’ve done something right because our “I was not made to be subtle” shirt landed on Amazon’s best sellers rank (at 260,917 😂) in just FOUR DAYS which according to Hannah is a huge deal because there’s like, 5 million shirts sold on Amazon!!! So here’s to supporting small businesses and ones that ACTUALLY help the greater good 🧠✨

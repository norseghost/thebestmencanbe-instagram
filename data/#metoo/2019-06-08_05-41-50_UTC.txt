Whenever I visit my friends @farmsanctuary Animal Acres outside LA, I am deeply touched, somewhat healed, inspired & motivated to keep fighting for them! Excited to take my new kiwi friend there as she is planning to start the very first farmed animal Sanctuary in New Zealand! #PeaceBeginsOnYourPlate #sanctuarynotslaughter

CW: STREET HARASSMENT, BULLYING

As a student myself, I found that when I asked people in my year for their stories, they were very often embarrassed to tell their stories because of bullying/people not believing them. The kind of behaviour that makes a young girl EMBARRASSED to tell people what she has gone through is nothing less than toxic. If the people who surround you bully you, LET THEM GO❣️

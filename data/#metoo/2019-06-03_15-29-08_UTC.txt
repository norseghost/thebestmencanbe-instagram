Years ago when Pehu was just ten or eleven years old,
For the first time she went to an invitation alone,
Let me correct , 
With her uncle and aunty without her parents due to some circumstances.
It all happened when they went to sleep,
Unfortunately, she happened to sleep in a hall,
Beside her so-called brother-in-law whom she met only twice,
It was half packed with people ,
So, she didn't asked to change her place,
Or how could a little girl like her understand what intuition is?
In the middle of the night she felt something,
Something very disgusting ,
A hand which was over her little body!
That hand moved up and down ,
Pehu felt something extremely bad happening  with her,
She removed his hand and turned over ,
That monster didn't stop in  that moment,
He continued to touch her until she broke down in tears,
He managed to make her understand it was nothing and not to tell anyone,
Pehu came back but didn't uttered a single word ,
Years later when she was in class nine or ten,
She had her first sex education at school, 
Was when she understood what happened with her back then,
She felt guilty not to raise her voice against it then,
Want to know what happened with her then?
She became traumatized in such a way,
Her past still haunts her,
She's still afraid to make any physical contact with her opposite sex!
That's what it harms even a kid or teen ,
To live their life freely,
To live in insecurities even to breath.

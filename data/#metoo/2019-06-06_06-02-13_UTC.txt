When it comes to being in a narcissist relationship, we don’t really know we are actually in one.  Until everything explodes and you are left picking up the pieces or you finally get out but somehow you still want to go back. You have been programmed for so long; So your mind tells you that’s what you need. I want you to know something, you deserve better. You are stronger than you know. .

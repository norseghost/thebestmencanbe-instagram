One sign of healing from trauma is not needing constant numbing and distractions.  For me alcohol was my drug of choice.  From the time I took my first drink at 14 years old, I was hooked. I was able to laugh, something that I rarely was able to do due to the turmoil and abuse I suffered at the hands of my mother and the various men she brought into our lives.  My muscles unclenched and the depression temporarily went away.  Finally I am able to have a drink or two without feeling a need to get drunk.  Meditation, eliminating the stressors in my life as much as possible, writing and talking about my past and counseling have been immensely healing.  I am so grateful to be at this point in my life.  I feel like I am finally living!  #survivor #speakup #abuse #fighter #metoo #meditation #mentalabuse #happiness #recovery #stronger #recovery #laughter #depression #nomoreshame #nomoreguilt #talkaboutthetrauma

June! The month filled with hope. Summer is here! I’ve known so many survivors who have a hard time summer. It’s when everyone starts looking at your body. You feel the eyes on you as you walk and your skin crawls. I didn’t wear shorts until two years ago for fear of men. I always felt super awkward wearing tank tops as I was taught not to ever let men see to much of skin. But you know what I’m good with my body. I’m good with being me no matter what I’m wearing. Long sleeves, tank tops, shorts, pants or dresses I’m good. I won’t hide and I won’t let what someone might do hold me back. It’s taken years for me to actually say that but I’m here and I’m me and that’s not going to change. #sexualabusesurvivor #goodenough #summer #whyididntreport #metoo #metoomvmt #metoomovement #melodiethurman #survivor #believewomen #selfconfidence #iamenough #sexualabuse #childhood #thelieswearetold

But when the results of the study on sex offenders came back in 2012 suggesting the programme might do more harm than good, Hopkins said her managers and the prison service met them “with anger and disbelief” ... The late change in methodology under a new author was questioned by Hopkins, who said they had been happy with the same methods when they were used for research that had more politically convenient findings.

Hopkins told the court: “I was commissioned to do the research because of my expertise and then it was decided I didn’t have the expertise after all, but only after the results were known.” #metoo #political

just some self care and healing pictures that i felt were beneficial to me so i thought i’d share them with you all!! oh oh yes! i forgot to say that i had a recovery win today!!! in my ap language class our final was to give a speech and i did mine about my abusive dad!! why is this a win for me? because i’ve spent so long, so damn long, in denial and opening up not only to myself but to a class full of my peers? terrifying yet extremely empowering. .

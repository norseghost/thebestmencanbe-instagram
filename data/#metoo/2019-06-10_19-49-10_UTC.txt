I witnessed a new, poignant dimension to this whole #metoo issue today at #TaiChi. My lovely teacher, Claire, was basically sexually harassed by an older student in front of all of us, a man who then for a final insult, said “I’m off, sweetheart” before walking out of the class a half hour early, having arrived a half hour late. She laughed off his handsiness in her lovely French accent with a seamless #deescalation comment: “he’s checking out the merchandise”. About his breezing in and out on his own schedule, she said only “you’re really taking the mickey.” A comment which she berated herself for afterwards as having been too harsh. 
TOO HARSH, MY PEOPLE.

I could not concentrate on my form after that. I was fuming. After class, I asked her if I could have her permission to say something next time he disrespected her like that. When I did karate, if you disrespected the Sensei you got bliksemed. And you KNOW Claire could bliksem this guy. She’s basically a human boomslang.

Well. The reaction of the teacher and the handful of (female) students who were still there surprised me. John had a stroke five years ago, shame, they said. (Sidebar, lets call him John.) We must help him get his confidence back. Isn’t it humbling but also sad that this mixed bag of dames of various ages all had the same instinct... that if objectifying and belittling us can help this poor guy feel like a man, he should have at it? Bless their giving hearts. #Woman is mother even to her stupid-ass oppressor. But if we don’t help an old dog learn new tricks - even a dog who is down and out - aren’t we part of the problem? At least I did get Claire to reluctantly agree that next time she’ll  say “hey, it’s not sweetheart, it’s SIFU to you, thank you.” #girlpower #mommylion #mamabear #sifu #respect #warriorwoman #knowbetterdobetter #dontcallmebaby #idontcareifyouhadastroke

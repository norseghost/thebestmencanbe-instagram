TW: rape, sexual assault, underage. CONTINUED IN POST. “I was 14 and it was the first time I had lied to my mom about going somewhere I wasn’t supposed to go. Me and a couple of my friends had been invited to a party, obviously our parents were not going to allow it so we all lied and said we were going to another friends house. We showed up way early and no one was really there. Someone gave me a bottle of alcohol and I proceeded to drink it all by myself. I blacked out. I remember about 25 minutes of a 6 hour night. I remember wanting to call this boy that texted me every once and a while. I had a major crush on him. My friend took my phone away and said “what if you accidentally call your mom, give me your phone!” I remember I was laying in a trailer or a truck bed of some sort. Someone pulled me up and I was so drunk I couldn’t move my head I was just staring at a torso, but it was his; the boy I liked. He then proceeded to carry me to his truck so I could get warm. They put my friend in the truck with me because just like me she was blacked out. She started to puke and he started screaming to get her out of his truck, but he said I could stay. I remember being happy about being warm and I could go to sleep. Next thing I know he was standing above me asking if I was okay.” - Haley CONTINUED IN POST. ‼️

Remember when my car broke down 2 weeks ago? Yea, huz is still working on it 💕💕. Bless his soul, he took half the engine apart 😰😰. .

I dropped him off at BNA this morning and quickly remembered why I chose to take my HOME based business full time, instead of getting out in that nonsense every day. 👐👐👐👐 Wheeew, who else looses all decency in that traffic?! 😂😂 😬😬 Can I get a #metoo ?!

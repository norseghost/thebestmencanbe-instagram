@ocsarts , Iâ€™ll start :) Tradition by Brendan Kiely: just because things have always been one way for years and years, it does not mean it is right. In the age of the #metoo movement this book resonates with me. NO MEANS NO @osceolamitd @brendankiely #readwokeosceola #readwoke #summerreadingincentive 
PS- This book is available in our MackinVIA. Interested to read your thoughts on it

TOUCH ME. In a world of lawsuits, Bro culture, the #MeToo movement, and various taboos and transgressions, physical contact has become fraught with negative connotations. Massage therapist Ryan Compton will talk about the impact that touch—and the lack of touch—has on our health… not to mention the effect on our society as a whole. Only at PechaKucha v26 on Saturday, June 29 at the Dr. Phillips Center.

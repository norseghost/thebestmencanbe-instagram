Can I just say... Can us women just get together already and get along? I know I'm a big piece of this. I must be healing and transmuting my own criticism of women (of myself) because I've encountered so much of this recently. Can us women love each other and support each other? If I come across a woman that is judging me or not acting in the most loving way, I assume that she WANTS to be acting in love, and is just hurt because of her own insecurities and past traumas. We all have traumas, and we all are responding out of protection and our attacking blueprints. But it is now time that we can heal, and we can actually love each other and come together in supportive healing space. I am working on this myself in the moment with putting my ego away and showing what the path of love looks like. I know you can do this too, so I invite you to be the first step. If I'm not showing up, please be that first step and show up, and I'll do the same for you in supportive Divine love. It is time we heal this. And if you are Divine masculine, you can support the feminine to get along, no more cattiness!!! Only loving words of worth and support, please #SupportWomen #HashTagIDontKnowWhatToHashTag #Surrender #Love #MeToo #Pleasure #Oneness #Connection #DivineFeminine #Healing #Health #Women #Friends Hash tag any hash tag suggestions? I want to reach women so they know there is an existing, loving, supportive background for what we are already desiring and need essentially P.S. These are two of the favorite photos of like the 20 I sent to my boyfriend/ true soul friend and so that's special to me (and okay all the rest were kinda of the river)

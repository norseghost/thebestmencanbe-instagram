The Panty Project is an ongoing social practice project. Participants, womxn and those who identify as womxn, courageously share with me their stories of experienced gendered transgressions and violent aggressions, whether cultural and/or interpersonal. Participants write a word or phrase onto the panel of their selected undergarment; I hand-embroider over their mark-making and photograph them as if they have been taken off. This work addresses the inherent misogyny within our language, and the consequential "essestializing" of womxn, which reduces womxn, and those who identify as womxn, to "less than." This work is about healing and transcendence. 
Womxn's long-silenced voices MUST be heard.

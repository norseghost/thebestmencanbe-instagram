#25booksin2019 Book 8: This was @oldtownbooks’ fiction book club June book. I didn’t really like it - I had trouble figuring out what was going on , the plot felt incomplete (although now I understand why) &, unlike many women in the group, I did not have a strong #metoo reaction to the storylines. But after today’s meeting, I may read it again, now that I understand the structure better. I didn’t share today because I wasn’t feeling great, but listening to so many smart women who are really good at analyzing writing & structure was inspiring. 
The book club has been great because it has made me pick up books I wouldn’t have otherwise, but I might try out the non-fiction group, since that’s more my jam.

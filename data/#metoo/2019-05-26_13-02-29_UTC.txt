In this time of overdue recognition of women, the root of all existence really, the essential nurturer, the balancer, the multi-tasker, the comforter, the rock upon which there is always a mooring when any of us must re-anchor, in this time when we see neglect, lack of respect, taking women for granted and otherwise being content that they are there but not recognizing their full voice and their right to it, we all -- men and women, boys and girls -- must set forth to change our ways.  Women -- this must be their time, now, henceforth. Their voice. We all must listen. 'VOICE,' a tribute to women, part of the related 'UNMASKED/The Men Among Us' art exhibit at Bel-Ans, Orangeburg, N.Y., June 1-July 28.#women#respect#metoo#freedomofspeech#dignity#recognition

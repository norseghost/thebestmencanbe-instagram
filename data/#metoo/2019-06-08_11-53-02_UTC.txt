WHAT ABOUT ME?  HOW DO I LEARN?⠀
.⠀
Q: Do you talk about your child's learning struggles but stay quiet about your own? ⠀
.⠀
When speaking at a conference a few months ago, a man approached me to ask what he could do to help his child.  He knew they were smart and capable as I had mentioned in my talk but he was at a loss of what he could do to empower them. ⠀
.⠀
He mentioned he also struggled to learn and related to my story. I said the most powerful thing you can do is talk to them about you.  How did you learn?  Is it similar to them?  Can you relate to their struggles?  Let them know.⠀
.⠀
Because when we take ownership of our way of learning without shame, we can offer this to our children.  It will give them what they need to continue to walk through this learning journey -- you have a powerful role to play as a parent.  You can say...me too. ⠀
.⠀
I learn in a way similar way. I’m just like you.  Or guess what, you can read better than I can (celebrate this too) . Let them know we all have strengths and weaknesses but that they are not alone.  It's not just about them.  You have your own learning journey. ⠀

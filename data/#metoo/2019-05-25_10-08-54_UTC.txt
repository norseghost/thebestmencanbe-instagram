I haven’t seen #rocketman yet. But I plan to after my vinyl session this morning. As a stay at home mum it’s important to carve out #metoo time. Otherwise people take advantage of a mother’s power and before you know it 2019 has passed us by and we haven’t stopped to follow the yellow brick road. So to all you mothers out there stay at home or otherwise...don’t forget to take T/O and give back to YOU. 🧕🏻👷🏻‍♀️👩🏼‍🍳👩🏾‍🏫👩🏿‍🔬👩🏽‍🎨👩‍🏭👩🏻‍🔧🕵🏼‍♀️👩🏽‍⚕️👩🏼‍🦰👩🏼‍🦳👩🏽‍💻🦸🏾‍♀️👸🏾🧝🏼‍♀️👩🏼‍✈️👩🏽‍🚒👰🏽🧜🏾‍♀️🤰🏽🤷🏻‍♀️ #rocketman #elton #metime #julie #juliesworld #goodbyeyellowbrickroad #goodbyenormajean #daniel #stayathomemumsuk #mumslife #livingit #middleclassliving #pianoman #pianomum

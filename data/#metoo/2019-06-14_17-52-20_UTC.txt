Fathers and Parents mean a lot to most. But to others parents  may reflect the most traumatic experience and relationship of their lives. Many people would never want to emulate what they experienced with their parents in any other relationships in their lives. Forgiveness is not about pretending it didn't happen, however it is a balance of not recalling and retelling the wrongs of the person that hurt you.  #fathersday day can mean #healing instead of #rage
.

This post is not about the Fathers that are angered by these post on their day. If you have to post to your mother, do it. But why not make it truly about you and not social media. It's about YOU healing and using inspiration to get to your abundance. Let's leave triggers out of your process. Let's stop defining love based on lack or fear. Abandonment is trauma. It is not an example of love or someone "doing their best" It did not leave you broken! It left you FREE to heal and create relationships you are proud of.

I\u2019m consistently doubting myself, constantly exhausted, and mentally drained.\nI\u2019m starting to think recovery made be harder than just continuing to suffer with mental illness.\nWhen I\u2019m calm & rational, I know that\u2019s truly just the disease talking. That\u2019s what makes it hard. \nI know bigger things are coming, I know where I am today won\u2019t be a fraction of where I\u2019ll be, and I know I trust enough in myself to make it happen. ..except on bad days. the days where I question the purpose of everything. Whether it\u2019s questioning the small decisions I make. whether it\u2019s questioning why I\u2019m not doing more with what drives me, or whether it\u2019s questioning my entire reason for being; I do it. It\u2019s constant questions, leading to bigger ideas, more strategies to become more engaged in my life\u2019s purpose and it never stops.\nSome days I just want to take a minute to rest and breath and just have nothing but quiet, but those days lead to weeks and weeks can turn into months. But recovery is hard for this reason. I want to be gentle with myself and remind myself to be patient with results and progress. But it drives me crazy knowing I can do more and will do more but I don\u2019t know how to do it yet.\n\nThe other hard part about recovery is truly letting go of my vices and what I have perceived as support. Taking big chances and pushing yourself doesn\u2019t always work out exactly the first time around and to step into that unknown over and over again with superficial support is  taxing. I\u2019ve had to start accepting that my comforts are a detractor from my progress.\n\nI\u2019m grateful for lunch breaks with macy, curled up next to me while I breathe and slow myself. IAnd I\u2019m grateful I have built a trusted support system I trust to see me fall apart and then encourage me to rise again.\n.\n#gratitudejournal #intj #intjfemale #mentalhealth #metoo #anxietyattack #anxietywarrior #depressionhelp #depressionrecovery #depressionsupport"

Good ministers share their personal experience or trauma to help the broken ppl heal or inspire them to speak their truth. That's what good ministers do and I've been thru a lot! Women coming together sharing their trauma is a form of healthy healing. I'm pretty sure my book will be a bestseller.ðŸ‘Œ*

Yesterday, I had the privilege of speaking at Fortress of Hope International's 3rd Annual Banquet, "Behind The Mask." I finally found the courage to come out and share my survival story of being sexually harassed in high school by a male teacher over 10 years ago.... #MeToo #SexualHarrassment #ChildSexAbuse #iSurvived

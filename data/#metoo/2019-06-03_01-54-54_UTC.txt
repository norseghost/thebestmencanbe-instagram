Finished the 30th International Trauma Conference over the weekend at World Trade Center Boston.
Bessel, the gentleman at upleft corner, has dedicated decades in the research on childhood trauma and its damages on one's brain, which negatively impacts one's self- regulating funcitonality, perception about self and the world, and interpersonal skills, among many others. 
Mental health is equally important as physical health. Seek help when in need, just as what you do when you experience physical ailments. 
I went to Bessel workshop one month ago for a group experience with trauma processing, and was full of joy meeting these wonderful facilitators again.. #besselvanderkolk

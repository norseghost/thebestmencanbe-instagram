I’m thrilled to announce my @ifundwomen crowdfunding campaign is live today and I need your help! 👉🏻 Link in bio. 
I’m excited to be raising money in a platform that supports women since my mission is to help inspire and empower women!  Please help support me in supporting women! 💗
Through my book and events I want women to know that they can change their own life, they can dream big and rise up through the obstacles they may be facing. 
With your help, I can continue on my journey to get my message out and in return you can receive some cool rewards! Just check out the many fun things like signed limited edition copies of my book, necklaces, journals, tote bags, coaching and even a cocktail party! 
I’m honored to share my story with you and thank you in advance for your support! xo 💗 #youglowgirl #youglowgirlbook #glowtogetherrevolution #yggbook #ifundwomen #crowdfunding #author

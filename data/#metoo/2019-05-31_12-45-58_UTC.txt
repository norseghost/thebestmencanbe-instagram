DAY 31- The future I want to see. 
Comprehensive sexuality starts early and supports people to develop life long understandings of bodies, pleasure, and respect. When sexuality is no longer shameful and bodily autonomy is the foundation of any sexual or romantic relationship then pleasure not power can be the motivation. Respectful, healthy relationships whether that's for an hour or a lifetime would all benefit from giving people the information they need. Education about private parts, knowing how babies are made (and not made), reproductive justice, sexual health and wellbeing, consent, pornography and so much more is the future I want to see.

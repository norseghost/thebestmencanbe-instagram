Upon reflecting on the state of current events, we need a group hug!
•••
There are so many nasty comments and low blow being thrown defending our “sides”
•••
What if we everyone, Republicans, Democrats, Liberals all sat down and discussed our feelings! Yes, our feelings! Our fears and the root of our anger and fears so that we can understand and come to compromise where we are all being heard and represented!
•••
There may not be a right answer, but there is an answer that will, with compromise, be acceptable to all parties.
•••
So for now, spread compassion and love cause ALL OF US ARE ACTING OUT OF FEAR!

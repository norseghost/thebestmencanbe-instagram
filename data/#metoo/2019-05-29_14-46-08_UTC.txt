The time has finally come! After 20 years of attempting to write this book, I've finally reached my goal!💪⁣
*⁣
When I first sat down 20 years ago to write this book, I struggled. I wanted to share my story but it just didn't feel right.⁣
*⁣
Last summer (2018), after 2.5 years of openly sharing my story of abuse and recovery, I sat down to write it again.🙏⁣
*⁣
This time was different. I realised I no longer needed to write about my abuse. Instead, this book is about my recovery.⁣
*⁣
More importantly, it offers something I desperately needed in those early and dark years of recovery - guidance.🙌⁣
*⁣
Your limitations do not have to stem from abuse or trauma. ⁣
*⁣
Not only does it have tangible steps for you to take in each chapter, it also includes a support challenge to fully empower you to overcome any limitation.⁣
*⁣
I'd like to thank everyone who has supported, motivated, inspired and encouraged me along this journey.😘⁣
*⁣
I'd also like to thank the future readers of this book. We may never get the chance to meet in person, but if you resonate with this and this book helps you, then I am one step closer to achieving my life's purpose. Thank you for being part of that.❤⁣

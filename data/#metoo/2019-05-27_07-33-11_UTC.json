                        "text": "When actress Emma Watson made her landmark HeForShe speech entreating men \u201cto take up the mantle\u201d of women\u2019s rights at the United Nations last September, she eclipsed another woman who took the podium earlier that day. A woman who is responsible for defending the rights of more than half the world\u2019s population \u2013 but of whom most people have never heard.\n\nPhumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the head of UN Women and former deputy president of South Africa, knows a little more about worldwide gender inequality than the former Harry Potter star, but she is relaxed about letting Watson take the limelight. \u2022 \u201cThere are lots of people who do not care what I have to say because I\u2019m one of the usual suspects,\u201d she says modestly. \u201cAlso, I just don\u2019t have that reach. People who follow me are more or less the converted. But when you have someone with a captive audience, especially a youth audience, you reach out to new people.\u201d With domestic violence, she says, no country can sit on its laurels. \u201cThe home is the unsafest place for a woman to be. In most countries where we have laws against violence against women it does not mean these laws are being implemented.\u201d Using the principles of the HeForShe campaign, Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka knows that women cannot solve the problem alone. \u201cIt\u2019s important to work with men and boys in every home and every community so you\u2019re fighting this behaviour.\u201d She is the second head of UN Women, the international body\u2019s newest department. It launched in 2010 with the former Chilean president, Michelle Bachelet, taking the helm for the first four-year term.\n\nMs Mlambo-Ngcuka was born in Durban, South Africa, in 1955, and trained as a teacher before turning to politics. As deputy president to Thabo Mbeki, she was the most senior female politician in South African history. But her political career came to an abrupt halt when Jacob Zuma took over the presidency.\n\nFor more, you can view the entire article on @the.independent."

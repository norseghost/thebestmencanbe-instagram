I’m after ten women (or men) that have been through an ED And are willing to talk openly about it. No age limit, all welcome. I want your insight, your views and your open thoughts on this mental disease that is so common in this day and age. .
My mission is to shine light for those who can’t  seem to break the addiction of the ED And offer support and tools to help change our thinking, and therefore our patterns.
.
If you are a woman, man, or teen that is open to talk with me for a chat, PM me now and I will get back to you.  I am founding a base for my book and I would love your insight, thoughts and experience with your life with Ana or Mia. .

Lately I have been trying to work on my relationship with God. We serve a God who is perfect. When Enemies try and take away our power, it is important to remember who is in charge God is. God will never give us more then we can handle. Life is hard, but God is GREATER. The enemy will never win, because GOD has overcome the world. ❤️ #Believe#GodisGreater#hehasovercometheworld#Metoo#Godisperfect#heknowsourhrut#Godknowsourpain#Heismighty#godcomesthrougheverytime#GodisGreat#Godknows#iLoveyoulord#yourGrace

Many of you were worried for my safety when I announced I was running in Serbia. I guess this journey has made me a little fearless and people in most countries are so in awe of my story and #footstepstoinspire that they show me support and care. Serbia is no exception. The turnout for the run this past Sunday 26 May was awesome. Felt like we took some steps towards change. Global run here we come ðŸ™Œ 
Hvala #Serbia for your welcome and support!!

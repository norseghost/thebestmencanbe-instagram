Whoever needs to hear it, I know trust is so hard. For some of us it is a lot harder than others because of the things we have been through. Some of us have a long road of healing ahead and that might seem unbelievably daunting at times. But itâ€™s always one step at a time. 
Best news is we never have to walk alone. God walks with us. He sees us. He knows our pain and struggles. He hears us. He will never stop loving us and He will walk on that path with us until He leads us to our new path. And then guess what..... He walks with us on that one too. 
Trust that God has your back. Trust that eventually all the pain youâ€™re going through will one day be a memory. Something you grew from, something you learned from, something that shaped you into the incredible person that is waiting on the other side. 
Stay strong and trust. Even on the hard days.

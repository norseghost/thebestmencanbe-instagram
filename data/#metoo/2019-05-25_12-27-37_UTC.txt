“Finding yourself is actually returning to yourself, an excavation, a remembering who you were before the world got its hands on you.”

Finding yourself is not always some grand discovery. You may not have a big coming of age story, but at the same time you might. It may take a long time, or it may happen when you’re young. However you peel away those outer layers & define who you are under them all is OKAY. Just know that it will happen, and being true to yourself is so important, no matter what anybody else says.

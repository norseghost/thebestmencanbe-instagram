Eleanor Roosevelt once said, "No one can make you feel inferior without your #consent." We talk a lot about consent in the #metoo movement around the topic of sex, but we can extend those notions into the realm of #personalempowerment.

If you get a rich, full, exciting experience from feeling inferior and subservient to someone else, by all means enjoy it fully. Consent to that #consciously with your full #awareness.

But if you catch a whiff of feeling lesser than another, and the blessed compass of your physical body indicates this feeling around another person is not in #alignment with your #soulspurpose, clear that notion of inferiority from your mind. Use sacred tools and recognize yourself as the full, #whole, #complete person you are, and make your exit from that experience.

#Love the other person fully at whatever distance you require.

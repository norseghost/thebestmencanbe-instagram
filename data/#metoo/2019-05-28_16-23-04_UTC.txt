A perfect occasion to say thank you!  First day of the Competition Dahab Apnea in Blue Hole.
I did new Aida National Record for Ecuador in the discipline CTWB to a depth of 52 meters.  This first day was filled with beautiful moments of vulnerability, strength, joy, humor. I am so grateful for the brilliant coaching of Linda Paganelli who managed , with a white glove to put me back in the best mindset and heart-set of confidence and joy.
I was so lucky to have with me as my competition Coach , my dear friend Ramón Carreño with his  calming presence and good humor. Big thank you to Ahmed Wahba my “ wall” and Raphael Freediver you are such a support and inspiration . Thank you Sahika for your word magic. Thank you Emília , Helena, Renée, Alexander and Budi. I couldn’t have dreamt of better training buddies. Thank you Omar 💙 #mujer #agua #nationalrecord #bifins #ecuador #fedasub #molchanovs #thisgirlcan #faith #confidence #thankyou #waoraniresistance #metoo  Foto Nacho Peláez 💙

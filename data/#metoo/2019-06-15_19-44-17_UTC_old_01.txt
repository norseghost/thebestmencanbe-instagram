🐍Finished Medusa tattoo design for myself! I want to get her on my thigh nice and big. 
I was inspired by some reading I was doing which brought up an interesting take on the myth of Medusa and Perseus, that Medusa was in fact seen as a protector of women and a symbol of female resilience and strength. "For her beauty she was raped and her ugliness she was punished." The story goes that Medusa, a priestess of Athena, was raped in Athena's temple by Poseidon, and all the gods though she should be punished for defiling Athena's temple with death. Athena, being clever, rather than punish her with death, gifted her the power to turn men to stone so that she would never be violated again. Medusa's head has been used in Greece as a symbol on women's shelters for centuries.
And since I resonate with many parts of this story, I decided to ink up the Gorgon for myself. I can't wait to get this piece done!

High, Everyone—⠀
⠀
We’re humbled by the support & response to #thisisjaneproject so far! Seriously— thank you.
🙏🏿🙏🏾🙏🏽🙏🏻 We have the deepest  gratitude for those who’ve participated so far— each of you have been a gift and a light to this nation-wide photo-activism campaign to destigmatize conversations around trauma, healing, and medicating w/ cannabis.

Interested in attending our next gathering + photo shoot? Fret not. Registration is live on the newly launched website. #linkinbio

There will be gluten free & vegetarian breakfast options, tea + coffee, as well as complimentary flower by the gems over at @stoneroadfarms. Thank you for supporting others heading down the road less traveled.. *** this is a donation-based event ***

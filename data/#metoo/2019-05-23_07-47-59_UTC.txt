I'm not an Angel. Please, don't put this such things on me.
I can break too. I always get scared of what people could be think about me.
I'm scared that when its revealed, the people, the ones who I love the most would leave me alone here.
I'm that girl who immediately trust you just because you were the only one (i don't have anyone else in this cruel world). And I know I was young. I was dumb. I was reckless. But, I don't deserve this.
I'm not a warrior. Why do you always hiding behind my back. 
It's me, boy. I don't want to hurt you or even touch you. But, why? Why you put this big burden on my shoulder?

This is Esther. Single mother to two beautiful little girls. She has proven herself as absolutely indispensable to @wacwausoap! She does every task so well and is so committed to the cause. And her kind heart is unmeasurable. She found her way to the group through some very sad circumstances though. As a housekeeper for a family, the man of the house assaulted her, then bribed the police so they wouldn't arrest him and she and her little girls were then suddenly homeless. I had a friend question my tough stance on men the other day. And you know, it pissed me off. Virtually every woman I work with on my projects has suffered violence and sexual assault from men. All the women in my immediate family certainly have. And women like Esther. So damn right, I will continue to be vocal and a hard ass on men!

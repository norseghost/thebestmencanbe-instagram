May i have 5minutes of your Time.. I have gathered the Courage to embark on a journey of giving back to the community  especially now that the world is not particularly a nice place. 
I would appreciate you so much if you could take time to walk with me on this journey.. be it by a simple act of spreading the word or by going the extra mile of being part of it and getting others to join in  This project is mainly to raise funds for organisations/ groups that are dealing with survivors  of GBV and Rape. Organisations that stand for the marginalized, judged and looked down upon groups such as The LGBTIQ.  And organisations that deal with educating and powering the masses  especially women and the Youth. 
Being a comic the best way i can help is by hosting a comedy show.. and i would love for you to attend.. so we raise funds for these groups while being entertained and also addressing these social issues that have plagued our community. 
All the profits of the show will be donated to these organisations so the more we attend the morw funds for these organisations to hold conferences/seminars keep providing services and safe spaces for the survivors and to continue being the voice of the oppressed.

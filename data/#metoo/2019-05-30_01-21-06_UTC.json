I feel a lot of pressure to be ok and to come across as ok because I share so much about mental health and recovery on my page. But, just because I share so much about mental health doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ve told you guys everything.\n Yes, I\u2019ve made huge strides in my mental health and I have overcome a lot. But that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t still suffer from depression and anxiety. I do. It does not just go away.  And that is ok. Everyday I am learning more about my personal mental health. What my triggers are, when I\u2019m genuinely happy and when I\u2019m not. There has been a lot of change in my life lately. Change that is uncertain and scary. I have had to learn to be open and honest with people in my life about when I am not okay. I have had to let myself breakdown in order to hopefully have a breakthrough. \nI have spent so many of my days and so much of my time making sure that everyone around me is okay and taken care of. Even if I wasn\u2019t. It is who I am. However, I would like to add taking care of myself to that. Learning to say no, taking time for myself, asking for help when I need it and talking to myself how I talk to everyone else around me. \nI\u2019ve been made to feel crazy and unworthy because of things I cannot control. I don\u2019t want others feeling that way. I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019ve had no one and had no purpose in this world. Sometimes I still find myself wondering. I\u2019ve had people\nCome into my life though who have shown me love, understanding and support. And if I can be SOMEONE for anyone. I want to be. I\u2019m not perfect and I can\u2019t be perfect. All I can be is me. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #selflove #keepfighting #anxietysucks #yourenotalone #strong #brave #mentalillness #willpower #mindset #support #survivor #dontgiveup #inspiration #faith #self #help #itsok #metoo #metoomovement  #yourestrong  #love #thegoodadvicecupcake #beyou #selfcare #yourebrave #yourebeautiful #youreunique #dontgiveup #keepfighting #health #mindset"

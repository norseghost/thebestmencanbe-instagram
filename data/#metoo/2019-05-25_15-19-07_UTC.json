You came and found us and decided we were not human, so the land could not possibly be ours alone. But I am the colour of the soil and the blood of my heritage has fed this land. As an African I wonder if she could speak for herself what my beautiful continent might say. So I wrote her \u201cme too\u201d, not on her behalf but hopefully to her standard, in the hope that you might understand. All I want for Africa is her freedom. She owns me, you see, and so long as she is owned by others, she cannot be free\u2014I cannot be free.\nLink in bio.\n\n#africaday2019 #africaday #shortstory"

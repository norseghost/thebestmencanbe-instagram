There’s one group of workers that are not covered by federal discrimination laws: freelancers/independent contractors. There are a few states that protect independent contractors from discrimination, but in most states, there are few legal rights for this group of vulnerable workers. ⁣

⁣And here’s more of the same infuriating take about and from HR that it’s HR’s job to protect the company - that they don’t care about contractors at all.  Or later, the only way to get HR’s attention is to threaten legal action.⁣

⁣If we’ve said it once, we’ve said it a thousand times: the goals of protecting employees’ rights and protecting the company DO NOT HAVE TO BE AT ODDS.  It is the role of the attorneys to protect the company.  Let them do their job.  HR, let’s focus on doing what’s right.⁣

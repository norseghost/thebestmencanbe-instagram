Did you guys know I started a movement? Iâ€™m working very hard on this project and I know itâ€™s going to be very time consuming but itâ€™s so going to be worth it! 
Fight Fearlessly is an outlet for those who suffer from trauma, rape, or abuse â€” whether it be domestic, sexual, verbal, or emotional. It is also a support group for those who have friends & family whoâ€™ve suffered and are looking for ways to help them cope. 
As a survivor of rape myself, I know how alone you can feel. Iâ€™m launching this page to empower both men and women to speak up, vent, or to even have their stories heard anonymously.

We are a pact, and together, we are warriors. You can follow our Instagram page @fightfearlessly ðŸ’™ðŸ’š

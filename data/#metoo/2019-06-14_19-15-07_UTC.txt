I was participating in a dinner the other day when this question was presented: "What commonly used word or phrase do you find offensive?"﻿
﻿
Well, feminist came to mind. While I don't find it as grating as some other terms, I will say the term has come to be a irritation of paper cut proportions for me especially in light of recent cultural events. I claim womanism over feminism because I strive to restore the balance between ALL people and the environment/nature and reconcil[e] ALL human life with the spiritual dimension. Mk. ALL. ﻿
﻿
So, tell me what word or phrase grinds your gears?﻿

•I GIVE THIS PRODUCT 5 STARS• i adore this oil so much. this is the restore repairing oil by selah organics but any rosehip oil does the job. this oil is super hydrating and very versatile. i use this on my face, lashes, brows, sometimes lips, and hair. a little goes a long way so i recommend using one drop. i love it. very hydrating. 100 percent recommend.-A.  #love #skin #clean #soap #makeup #remove #scrub #facescrub #review #skincare #sheabutter #shea #butter #joy #feelgood #wellness #explorepage #smellgood #shave #smooth #lavender #soft #thread #instalife #blog #wet #myskin #metoo #eos #pride

âœ¨The future is brightâœ¨
#TBT to our visit @uottawa to speak about the future of gender equality in Canada. We got to meet some really passionate and intelligent students and were so impressed with their thought-provoking questions and comments. We talked about the importance of self-care when traversing the world of activism and advocacy, especially with social media which can be so crucial yet so cruel. Is social media self-care a workshop that people would attend? Let us knowðŸ‘‡!

REVIEW: Another powerful and moving read from Gay. Having slowly worked my way through Bad Feminist first, I was able to easily fill the holes she left open in Hunger with the knowledge gained from that precious essay collection. Gay exposes the realities of living in her particular body with such vulnerability and openness, providing much needed perspective regarding what it means to be obese in the world. It brought home just how disordered most of our eating is, especially as women, and how much of that is tied in with the various traumas we have experienced or inherited. As she did with Bad Feminist, Gay helped me realise how sexual abuse impacted my mind, behaviours, and body by openly and movingly sharing how her experiences changed her, shedding light on places Iâ€™ve hidden away. If youâ€™ve experienced abuse, this might be a healing read if youâ€™re in the right place in your recovery. If youâ€™ve not experienced that kind of trauma, then I cannot recommend this book enoughâ€”with such a portion of our global population enduring at least one experience of sexually related trauma, itâ€™s vital for those who are fortunate enough not to have been in that position to understand the potential impacts. We need more empathy and education on this topic, and this is a great place to start. This memoir is medicine in so many ways.
READERâ€™S ADVISORY: Definitely read Bad Feminist, also by Gay. The two are inextricable. For more iterative nonfiction with a feminist bent, try Bolinâ€˜s Dead Girls.

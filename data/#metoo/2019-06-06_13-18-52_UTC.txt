Reminder for your Thursday morning! ☀️ .
.
Reacting in anger is often a habit many of us have as a response to our trauma. One step to healing is to remember, we don’t need to react right away to every situation. Often we need to allow ourselves the time to calm down so we can respond to, not just react to, the other person. .

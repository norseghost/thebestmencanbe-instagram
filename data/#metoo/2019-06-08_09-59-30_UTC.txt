A Soft Rebellion in Paradise by Artist Chloe Brown screens in the very square it was filmed today! 12 - 9pm @sheffdocfest ðŸ”¥
.
A Soft Rebellion in Paradise was conceived in response to Sheffieldâ€™s proud history as a city known for its political activism and where, in 1851, the Sheffield Womenâ€™s Political Association was the first organisation in Britain to call for female suffrage. It focuses in particular on the voices of women that are too often silenced and lost in the retelling of histories around the world. Following in the wake of the â€˜Me Tooâ€™ movement, the film questions the systematic contemporary and historical silencing of womanâ€™s voices.

After I wrote my essay, "I Was a Promiscuous Teen: An Open Letter to All the Men from My Past", my art began to change. No longer is it just about making pretty things or getting to that meditative state through art.  Both of those things are still important to me, but the world-wide reaction I received from my essay changed me.  I see the importance in talking about "unspeakable" things.  I see the power that comes from expressing truth.  I see the freedom that other people receive from knowing they are not alone.  Art is more than just a beautiful painting hanging on your wall.  Art is the weapon of expression.  They don't call them truth bombs for nothin'.

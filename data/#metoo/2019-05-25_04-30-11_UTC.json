And five years later when Bannon wound up at Breitbart, he resolved to try and attract those people over to Breitbart because he thought they could be radicalized in a kind of populist, nationalist way. And the way that Bannon did that, the bridge between the angry abusive gamers and Breitbart and Pepe was Milo Yiannopoulous, who Bannon discovered and hired to be Breitbart's tech editor.\n\nFrom the time I met him in 2011, he's had exactly the same politics. The same stuff you heard from Trump, you saw on the campaign trail. What he was looking for was a vessel because nobody in Republican Washington believed in these kinds of ideas. The whole trend in the Republican party was toward liberalizing immigration laws, passing comprehensive immigration reform. He was against it.\n\nJoshua Green\nDevil's Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of the Presidency\n\n#marketing #trending #profit #political #success #collective #ootd #politics #trending #metoo #timesup #trend #strategy #feminism #finnishgirl #freedom #graphics #future #lifestyle #journalist #journalism #psychology #god #fashion #trendy #hygge #blogger #influencer #business #lgbt #concept"

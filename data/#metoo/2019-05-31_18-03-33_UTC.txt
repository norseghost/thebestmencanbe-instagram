This April, South Korea’s highest court deemed a 66-year old ban on abortion unconstitutional. It was a surprising but necessary victory for a society where, throughout its long history, its women and their bodies have always been devalued. The nearly inexhaustible war men have always waged over who owns their mother-sister-daughter’s bodies reached its nadir during WWII, when thousands of girls, some as young as nine, were shipped off (250K+ by conservative estimates) to Japanese military outposts as sex slaves with either the tacit lookaway or near-zealous assistance by Korean men. These so-called “comfort women” were raped systematically by soldiers who, naturally, needed an outlet when there was no mortal enemy to direct their guns at. I discovered this collection of stories while researching about these women for my play, “A Dream Called Laundry”. It was a revelation for many reasons, not the least of which was that it was beautifully translated and featured women protagonists at the center of its stories, neither of which I had encountered with any satisfying frequency. And these stories were not florid evocations of longing and unrequited love from the feathered quill of some crown prince’s literate concubine. These were honest, often hard scrabble stories, with three-dimensional women characters living real lives in the aftermath of yet another senseless war conducted by men (anyone know what the point of the Korean War was? 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️) My favourite Korean writers are featured in these pages. On their shoulders stand the internationally-recognized, prize-winning writers of today (Han Kang, Kyung-Sook Shin), but more significantly, those brave women who, against overwhelming historical forces, are taking back their innate right to their own bodies- the unheralded warriors on the frontlines of the war to truly end all wars.

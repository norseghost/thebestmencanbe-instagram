i deserve to be this happy ðŸ¦‹
i finally made it out of the house today so iâ€™m really proud of myself! iâ€™m still in a lot of pain and i felt like i was gonna pass out a couple times but i did it! i got a haircut and said goodbye to 8 inches ðŸ˜± my hair has never been this short but i think it makes me look older and i love it :â€™) new hair new me!!!

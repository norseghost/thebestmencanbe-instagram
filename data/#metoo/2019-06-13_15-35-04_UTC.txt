Activist Marcelina Bautista has a message for governments, businesses and consumers.

We are calling on the #UKGovernment at #ILO100 to ensure a strong and inclusive global law is agreed to protect workers from violence and harassment in the workplace.

Share and join the fight for women workers everywhere.

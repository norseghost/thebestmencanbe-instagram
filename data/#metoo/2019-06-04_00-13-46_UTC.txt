This picture is NOT about getting skinning or the fact that my stomach is a little flatter and less bloated after a two day reset. A picture doesn’t tell you the story. It’s easy to judge a picture that can mean so much to someone. This picture means a lot to me. It represents results - healthy results mind, body, and soul. I FEEL better. I’m slowly coming out of the fog from baby three and 18 months of a breastfeeding journey that has come to an end. I’m loving my body every step of the way for the first time in my entire life. So yeah, maybe I found a way to feel better in my own skin- but I assure you this is not a “diet thing”💗 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻 I find it so interesting that so many people talk about creating long term lifestyle changes and searching for a way to truly feel good, live healthier, and reach health goals for themselves and their family BUT then look at my lifestyle and call it a “fad diet” or a “quick fix”. I have to believe there is a breakdown of education and miss information happening. My favorite “are you really going to drink those shakes forever?” OR “I prefer real Whole Foods” #metoo! If you understood- you’d probably want to incorporate this nutrition in your or your families life in one form or another too! It’s nutrition that helps an elite athlete perform their best and at the same time helps a mama who’s growing life in her belly. It’s nutrition, back by science, and gives results you can’t get anywhere else. Yes- it’s true. •
It’s been 4 1/2 years you guys. Over 4 years of this LIFESTYLE. I use full meal replacement smoothies in many different ways to consume the nutrition. We make shakes, we bake, we get creative! My WHOLE family consumes this nutrition daily! I take high quality daily vitamins and minerals with telomere support every single day. I use high quality probiotics and digestive enzymes- (GAME CHANGER FOR MY GUT HEALTH) I eat REAL food and honestl

Good morning. I'm off to day 3 at the International Trauma Conference in Boston, Ma. .
.
Today I am especially looking forward to hearing from Dr. Bessel Van Der Kolk @thebodykeepsthescore talking about the neuroscience of trauma and @taranajaneen talking about the #metoo movement. .
.
Walking to catch the train I couldn't help but smile at all the beauty after the rains last night.  I had to stop to take a picture of at least one flower. There's lots lots of symbolism here if we can stop a moment to notice and partake in the simple flow of life.

Breathing in 1 2 3

Breathing out 1 2 3 4 5
.
It shall be a great day. 
With much appreciation, 
Laura

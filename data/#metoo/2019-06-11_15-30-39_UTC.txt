Today, Justice for Lai Dai Han was joined by Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Nadia Murad, and other distinguished Parliamentary guests, including Chair of the Vietnam All Party Parliamentary Group, Wayne David MP and Co-Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne at Church House near Westminster for the unveiling of a statue honouring all victims of sexual violence, including the Lai Dai Han. 🗣 Earlier, Rt. Hon. Jack Straw said:
“The statue unveiled today puts a face to the names of the women and children who are victims of Korean wartime sexual violence. We need an independent investigation by the UNHCR into the rape of Vietnamese women by South Korean soldiers. We must demonstrate that we remain committed and supportive of all victims of sexual violence.” 🔎  http://bit.ly/LDHeventpress .

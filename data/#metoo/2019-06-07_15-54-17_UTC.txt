I received so much love yesterday as I began to open up with my story in our efforts to advance our movement’s visibility. Y’all, I’m ready for this. I’m ready to fight for the power they take from us. I’ve fought so much hellfire in my life to prepare me for what may be the biggest battle I’ll ever fight. I’m ready to stand tall and strong and smiling: smiling that I’m still here and that together we will stand up for the rights that are owed to us. We will stand up for the men and women who just can’t say the words yet: #ImASurvivor. But don’t worry about me: I’m the woman who walks around with a joyful tenacity like her name is spelled out somewhere in bright, glittery letters, just like they were in my berthing on this deployment in 2013. This photo is so special to me, because those glittery letters came in a care package from my mother, who knew her daughter was a tough broad who lived for vibrancy: we can find joy in anything that we do, so long as the purpose is valuable. Today I am filled with joy and purpose: you are not alone, you are majestic as hell, you can heal, and I can show you how. #endMST #linkinbio

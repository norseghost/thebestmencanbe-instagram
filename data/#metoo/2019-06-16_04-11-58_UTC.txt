Thrilled to have stumbled upon a new area of town; Plaza Barranco Butters. Best of all, we entered into the local market there and ventured to eat an authentic lunch of chicken, rice and causa (see story). What I find so intriguing in Latin America is that what you see now, is definitely not what you see later. Many establishments lack permanent signage, which means when you walk by at 2pm and they’re closed, you don’t even know they exist because they are gated up. It’s only later, when things get going, that their portable sign goes up and you know they’re in business.

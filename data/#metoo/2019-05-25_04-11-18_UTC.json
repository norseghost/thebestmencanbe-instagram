                        "text": "\u201cThe Storm is coming,\u201d say the conspiracy theorizers whose grotesque imaginings terrified the country to attention this week. Maybe they\u2019re right.\n\nThe simplest description of the plot line goes something like this: President Trump isn\u2019t under investigation; he is only pretending to be, as part of a countercoup to restore power to the people after more than a century of governmental control by a globalist cabal. Also, there are pedophiles.\n\nA figure named \u201cQ,\u201d who supposedly possesses Q-level security clearance, disperses \u201ccrumbs\u201d that \u201cbakers\u201d bring together to create a \u201cdough\u201d of synthesized information. (This is not how baking works, but that seems the least of our worries.) Because Q is the 17th letter in the alphabet and 17 is also a number Trump has said a few times, among other clearly-not-coincidences, he is the real deal, not an Internet troll engaged in an elaborate example of live-action role-play.\n\nThat\u2019s what QAnon followers really want, after all. That\u2019s where their \u201cstorm\u201d motto comes from. Most Americans were puzzled when, in a meeting with military leaders months ago, Trump said, \u201cYou know what this represents? Maybe it\u2019s the calm before the storm.\u201d But these theorists thought they knew exactly what he was talking about. Trump was pointing at the officers\u2019 uniforms.\n\nThe storm QAnon truthers predict will never strike because the conspiracy that obsesses them doesn\u2019t exist. But while they wait for it, they\u2019ll try to whip up the winds, and the rest of us will struggle to find shelter. QAnon is scary because it\u2019s getting bigger, it\u2019s scary because we don\u2019t know how to stop it, and it\u2019s scary because the people behind it won\u2019t be stopped, and, until their illusory storm arrives, they won\u2019t be satisfied.\n\nMolly Roberts\nThe Washington Post\n\n#marketing #trending #profit #political #success #collective #ootd #politics #trending #metoo #timesup #trend #strategy #feminism #finnishgirl #freedom #graphics #future #lifestyle #journalist #journalism #psychology #god #fashion #trendy #hygge #blogger #influencer #business #lgbt #concept"

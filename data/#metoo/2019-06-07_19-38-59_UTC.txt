Sorry for not posting any pictures for a while! I’m taking a summer math class and let’s say it requires a lot of time. I wanted to post about one of my favorite genres of books: graphic novels. I especially love graphic novels that deal with hard subjects. Do you guys have any favorite ones? Please recommend them because I’ll read them up!  #yabooks #book #bookstagram #books #graphicnovel #speak #bloom #lauriehalseanderson #pride #lgbtbooks #lgbt #metoo #bookshelves

Stop going after what everyone is else is going after. Go for your passions, your dreams. If I had listened to the voices in my head, the “advice” people were giving me, I wouldn’t be where I am today. ✌🏻

It’s been almost 5 years since I started my own business and it’s been 2 years since I made another decision to leave an unhealthy work environment. Both times, people gave their not so very nice opinions and when the second decision was made, I was laughed at to my face. And guess what, everything has worked out. You guys, we have one life to live! Just one! Make it count and stop worrying about what others are going to think or say. There is only one person you have to answer to and He will lead the way. #igrunner #runningcommunity #occupationaltherapist #runhappy #halfmarathoner #training #fitspo #runspiration

Watching @officialmelb on @piersmorgan is heart breaking. She's recovered from an abusive relationship and has three beautiful girls.

No matter who you are, what resources you have or who is in your life, you can be abused. 
Coercion and controlling behaviour is not ok and it's now illegal. Do you know that you can also report domestic abuse to the police as a third party now? It's an amazing breakthrough for women who have been abused without physical bruises.

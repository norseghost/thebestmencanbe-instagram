Very true. Same goes with “i’m going to raise my son not to be a rapist.” Statements like these insinuate that us men are naturally inclined to rape. Which is clearly false. What many don’t seem to realize is than an incredibly minute percentage of men are actually rapists. Instead of pinning this issue on men, why not address those actually guilty of the act.

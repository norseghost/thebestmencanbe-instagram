“What happened to AIB?”
Following AIB’s statement, @gursimrankhamba puts out one of his own.
.
TL; DR
1. “Since the allegation surfaced, an informal committee was set up to look into it […] Because I had nothing to hide, I voluntarily chose to participate and began by extending all possible cooperation to this committee. However, this process, which lasted 4 months was replete with procedural lapses and did not follow principles of natural justice.”
2. “I requested the committee to recuse itself and a fresh committee to be constituted. My request was denied, and hence I was left with no choice but to withdraw from the enquiry.”
3. “I maintain that I am happy to cooperate with any committee that is constituted fairly”
4. Khamba has also announced the launch of his own venture, Light@27, a comedy consultancy (no idea why this bit is in the statement tbh 🧐)

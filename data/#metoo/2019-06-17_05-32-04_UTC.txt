Indian girl. Indian girls are RAPED
.
.
Before the #metoo movement could gather rage and empathy enough for women out there, there was a burst of #notallmen and of course a small percentage of women who misused the movement etc etc.
.
.
But here’s the thing. Every country I go to, every new person or cab driver I talk to, asks me where I’m from.. and I say India.
—
India is my country, my pride. —
But statistically, 60% of the time I say “I’m from India”, the immediate response is “Oh! I’ve heard india is not safe for women” or “girls are raped in India”.
.
.
‘Now hold one one second’, I tell myself and I choose my next words VERY carefully. I explain with patience that yes, it’s a painful truth- that unforgivable, #castration and #deathpenalty worthy crime. It takes away EVERYTHING from a woman. It’s something that a person can NEVER overcome in one lifetime (given that she wasn’t killed in the process)
.
.
But also. It’s a population game. Not every woman in India is raped and NO, it’s NOT something we’re “used to”. Come on!
.
.
It’s funny I had to type the above sentence on a public forum.. but I’m tired of being asked. #everywhere I go.
And what do I say? I mean my country is BEAUTIFUL. My people are amazing.
.
.
And when people tell me that I’m really “brave” that being an #indiangirl I have the courage to travel alone etc.. I feel terrible. 
I love travelling. Being called brave just because I’m doing something I love? I’m confused: am I supposed to feel good about it?
.
.
And once we get into that topic.. there’s a slight tremor in people’s voice when they ask me..” So... have you been...umm.. raped?”
.
.
Honestly, I just turn up the volume on my headphones and pretend that the conversation never happened.
Just like in real life. .
.
I wish I could reach out.. reach out to everyone in the world and tell them that India is so much more than a #rapenation 
Indian girls are NOT used to being cat called or raped. No, we’re not used to it. Not now, not ever.
.
.
Ok then.

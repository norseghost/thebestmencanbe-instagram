@theconversationdotcom I'm curious how many Americans are aware of this? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Of 173 countries studied by @worldpolicycenter, only five do not offer paid maternity leave: Lesotho, Liberia, Papua New Guinea and Swaziland... and the US. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Embarrassingly, I admit I didn't know maternity leave was really "a thing" before I moved to Canada. I hate to say, but ignorance in America about anything outside the US is a common trend. And now, everyone I talk to back home is shocked when I tell them what Canada offers for family support. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I'm curious, would you do something about this to change it in America if you could? And if not, what would be your reasoning? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
And I'll share my personal experience: this has shown to be a humane way to treat people and that both men and women in my place of work express they support it because they value both family and the women going on maternity leave. And they want them to be able to come back and progress in their career while supporting the children of our future. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

The Whisper Network by Chandler Baker ğŸ¤« .
ğŸ¤« 
Sloane, Ardie, Grace, and Rosalita have worked at Truviv, Inc. for years. The sudden death of Truvivâ€™s CEO means their boss, Ames, will likely take over the entire company. Each of the women has a different relationship with Ames, who has always been surrounded by whispers about how he treats women. Those whispers have been ignored, swept under the rug, hidden away by those in charge. But the world has changed. This time, when they find out Ames is making an inappropriate move on a colleague, they arenâ€™t willing to let it go. This time, theyâ€™ve decided enough is enough. Lies will be uncovered. Secrets will be exposed. And not everyone will survive. As page one tells us, "If only you had listened to us, none of this would have happened."

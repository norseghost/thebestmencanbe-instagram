On Thursdays, We Read ðŸ“š 
This weekâ€™s read was chosen by the universe itself. Woman of Color is @latonyayvette â€™s collection of essays, styling and beauty advice that explores the experience of black womanhood (like holding her blog in your hand). I had the privilege of meeting her at a @createcultivate NYC book signing, and then a week later ran into her book at a cafe, at @popupat8th , and on the train- so when I said theÂ Â universe had this weekâ€™s pick in mind, I wasnâ€™t kidding

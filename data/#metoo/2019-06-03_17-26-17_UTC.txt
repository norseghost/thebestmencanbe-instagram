"My name is DadÃ© and my deepest gratitude comes from the fact that Iâ€™m not perfect.

I make tons of mistakes, I fail more often than not. I didnâ€™t always know this, because I used to validate myself by thinking I was always right. And so many losses later, here I am.

Which leads me to give my whole heart and mind to the love of God. The love that tells me to get up and keep goingâ€”the love that allows me to be me in the safest way possible while erasing the burden of ever trying to impress anyone.

Itâ€™s teaching me to see the best in others so I can attempt to love them the sameâ€”I canâ€™t imagine a more perfect gift."

#triggerwarning for rape & sexual assault. This is a cute take on a sadly deadly serious subject. Supposedly men are super nervous about being called out because of #metoo #metoomovement .They fear false accusations, young men’s “lives will be ruined” with zero regard to the women that survive their assaults. Even other women will defend bad actors because they like them or are related to them. Some suggest that only eight to ten percent of women report their rapes to the police, leaving at least ninety percent of rapes unreported. False accusation fearmongers stir the pot. But something no one considers. While an estimated two to eight percent of sexual assaults or rapes are falsely reported, this number only affects the number of REPORTED rapes; therefore, the amount of false reports in comparison to the total number of sexual assaults and rapes is likely closer to .002 to .008%. Statistically, it is overwhelmingly more likely that a person alleging sexual assault or rape is telling the truth than making a false accusation. Youngblood’s, it’s not rocket science, be respectful, be courteous, unambiguously consensual sex is amazing. And, if you’re not sure you have consent? You DON’T. Stand down. Ive already stared conversations about consent with both of my kids. Unfortunately, America’s fear of talking about Sex leaves many ignorant. Realize the unique risk for women and be sensitive to it. It’s not a game. It’s not about you feeling rejected or lead on. Fuck your feelings. At any time, she can change her mind. So can you. “Why do men feel threatened by women?” . . . “They’re afraid women will laugh at them.” . . . “Why do women feel threatened by men?” . . . “They’re afraid of being killed.” Second Words: Selected Critical Prose, 1960–1982, Margaret Atwood.  #beliveher #consentissexy #consentalways #letstalkaboutconsent

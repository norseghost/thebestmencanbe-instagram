Can I just take a hot second to brag on what an amazing mother my daughter is? ⠀
⠀
Throughout her pregnancy, she was so conscientious of what she put in her body.  And my, oh my, does it show in her precious son! ⠀
⠀
I’m so grateful to have a family who’s committed to pursuing health through every stage of life. ⠀
⠀
Would any of y’all be interested in hearing a little from her on what she did during her pregnancy? Let me know and I might just try and twist her arm into writing a little blog post for y’all.

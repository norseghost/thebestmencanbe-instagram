Every year secondhand smoking causes more than 41,000 deaths. Not only does it expose you to toxic carcinogenic chemicals, but it is also one of the major reasons that cause heart attacks! So, this No Cigarette day, take a pledge to quit smoking and discourage smokers to reduce the problems caused by passive smoking! #saynotosmoking #metoo #notopassivesmoking #WorldNoTobaccoDay

Raped When she Was 10

This is a true story of a 14-year-old girl, living in the United States .

Emma, a 14-year-old teen, has been keeping the rape a secret from the age of 10. 
Here Emma shares her powerful story of facing profound pain: "I just gave a report about how my stepdad used to rape me and it’s really hard to have to remember that happening to me since I was only ten. Everything hurt, my stomach was bruised and I was bleeding profusely. It just feels like I’m still trapped by him. 
I can’t talk to my family about it either; when I first told them, they called me a slut and a liar. I don’t know what the hell to do anymore. I flipping gave up" 
It hurts to know that a child has been going through such a mental, physical and sexual abuse. She fears to report it to others because of negative social attitude to rapes, because of stigma, because the perpetrator is her mother's partner, and mostly because she knows she will be let down by the people who has her custody.

She is still stuck, helpless, waiting for some magic to appear. She doesn't want to live with someone who doesn't trust her. She doesn't want to see people who knew that she was raped but still they were silent. She doesn't want to live in a place where she was raped. That place still haunts her. It still traumatises her. For her, optimism is a fantasy. She is done. She wants to end her life now. She can't take it anymore. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. The world has turned dark for her.

ATTENTION-Jennifer Weiner fans-she has a new book coming out June 11th!

@jenniferweinerwrites brought me back into reading, after a very long hiatus throughout college & grad school.  I picked up Good In Bed then In Her Shoes, & Little Earthquakes...one after the other.  And I was utterly in LOVE. 🥰

I’ve been staring at it waiting to devour it closer to the Pub Date.  Well, last night I started and have read throughout the night.

Thanks to @atriabooks & @simonandschuster for this. I could barely deal with myself. I am honored and stoked and humbled to be able to read this novel as an ARC.

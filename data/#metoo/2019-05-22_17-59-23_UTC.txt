We blame, we shame, we judge, we criticise! 
Everyone who appears in your life and causes tension, pain, sadness. Is showing you where you are out of alignment with source energy and ultimately yourself. No one can make you feel anything, it’s your own personal choice. Everyone you cross paths with is showing you were you stand in relationship to yourself. Someone triggering you is merely the mirror to where you need to work. 
Look at everything as an opportunity to learn, grow and then your life will change. Everything that happens to you  is happening for you. Your soul has a plan for you ❤️

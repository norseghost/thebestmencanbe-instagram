And that’s a wrap on #guysatpartieslikeit .
I knew before I even auditioned for this that Mary was meant for me. Her tenacity, bravery and fire was something that I wanted to embody in myself. I remember talking with friends and family during the audition process about taking on such a role. Wondering if I was ready for the risks and responsibilities that came along with it. Though this is a fictional film, the events are all too real for so many women in the world. This has been the most challenging roles of life, and the scenes are hard to watch. But that’s exactly why the story needs to be told. .

The very first thing I usually do with a role is research the name of the character. Sometimes writers name characters for a purpose, and sometimes it’s random.....I found the name Mary means Rebel, and she grew from there. .

Mary, thank you for teaching me to be rebellious in every way possible. I will love you forever ❤️ .

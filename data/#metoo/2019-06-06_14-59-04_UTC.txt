The impacts of criminalizing abortion in terms of foster care are severe for both the mother and the child. Women will often feel guilt and loss when placing their newborns into the foster care system. The child that grows up in the foster care system will be at high risk for PTSD, Major Depressive Episode, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. He or she will also face academic problems as it has been found that less than 3% of foster care children will actually attend higher education from constant transitioning between different homes. According to the Educational Stability for Foster Care Youth in Pennsylvania, for every home transition, the child will lose 4-6 months of academic progress.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

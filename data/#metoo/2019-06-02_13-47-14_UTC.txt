“RESISTANCE” [11/17], hand-printed black ink on kozo rice paper, is a relatively large print (23 x 30 cm), which I made while working on my comic “Machine Time” in late 2017. The woman in the image, drawn like a comic character, represents a fighter or survivor. In her strong, defensive stance, she combines the most valuable characteristics of all: She’s at once fierce and gentle. Assist her in braving the storm by filling the speech bubble with your own words of resistance! NOTE: Since I seem to have lost the linoleum plate for this print, it has just turned into an extremely limited edition. I might sell one of the three prints I’ve been able to keep on @etsy (or DM me your best offer).

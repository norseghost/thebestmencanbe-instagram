Learning with and from @amandalaird üíú "What if instead of a balance it was a rhythm?" ‚Å£
‚Å£
This was the question I posed to @unwellunlimitedly earlier this week when she shared that she was struggling with balance. ‚Å£
‚Å£
I know that struggle. Believe me, I‚Äôm a Libra. ‚Å£
‚Å£
And here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned from a lifetime of trying to ‚Äúfind balance‚Äù between work and life, being a mother and being an individual, green smoothies and nuggets‚Ä¶ ‚Å£
‚Å£
Balance is precarious. ‚Å£
‚Å£
You think you‚Äôve got it just right and then the scales tip in the blink of an eye. All the while underneath your efforts for balance is the subtle suggestion that you‚Äôre falling short on SOMETHING. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Thinking of life instead as a rhythm leaves room for, well, life. There are going to be times when everything feels easy (hello, follicular phase) and when it feels like you‚Äôre swimming through mud (#imluteal). When you‚Äôll be working too much. Or maybe not enough. When your family is your number one focus and other times when it‚Äôs just not. ‚Å£There will be times when your body craves a salad, and others when it just fucking won't. ‚Å£
Recognizing the rhythm is part of body literacy. There‚Äôs a good chance a lot of these ebbs and flow align with your cycle (although not always). When you know that you‚Äôre in a season and that the season will change you can care for yourself accordingly ‚Äì with what YOU need at that moment. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Do you strive for balance or do you go with the flow? ‚Å£
‚Å£
Thanks to @workingensemble for introducing the concept of the work/life rhythm to me a few years ago! ‚Å£

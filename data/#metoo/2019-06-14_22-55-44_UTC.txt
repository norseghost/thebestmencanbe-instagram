Let's start this page in the best way possible by reminding you that #captainmarvel - THE FIRST FEMALE SOLO SUPERHERO MARVEL FILM - has grossed $1.1 billion making it:
• the second highest grossing film of 2019
• one of the only 3 solo Marvel movie that earned more than 1 billion
• the 9th highest grossing superhero film of all time
• the 22nd highest grossing film overall

So thank you @brielarson for let every little girl, teenager and woman out there see that we can be whatever we want to be.

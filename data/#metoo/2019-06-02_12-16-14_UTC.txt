How do we judge these things? What makes a man/woman capable or incapable of committing a deadly crime or sin, his/her position? Who made clergy 'ethereal' and non-clergy 'ordinary'? Why can't we believe victims?  What are we sacred of? Sacred that the man or woman who we have given God status is in fact human and capable of falling? I am asking all of this, because what I have seen and heard when it comes to this issue, is ATROCIOUS! 
Let's talk lovelies, what do you think?

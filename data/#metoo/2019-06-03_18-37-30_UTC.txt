"It is a wonder that the fleshed out female body is so ghostly and alive." In a remarkable act of intertextual excavation, Janice Lee wrote through lines from Careen into her personal #metoo story of an Asian American girlhood for American Book Review.

.I am awed by this retrieval of memory, and I am reminded of why I wrote Careen, and who I wrote it for: myself, at every age I ever been, and everyone who ever felt "the impossibility of articulation" when it came to shame, guilt, and love. We are all bodies in space; our lives cut across time. Eventually, we set down heavy truths in order to keep on moving. "And the stones, the bones of the landscape, heavy, the mouth of the beyond, wind and voice, heavy...I set forward, and as I breathe, I feel my bones relax, and what I had accused myself of is no longer a burden, just the blue of tomorrow and today and today and again, today."

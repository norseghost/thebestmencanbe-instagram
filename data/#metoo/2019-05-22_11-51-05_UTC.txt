Trigger warning; rape, domestic abuse, violence* 
Today is the day I've had enough. I've had enough of all the structural and systematic injustices and violence committed, and that continues to happen, throughout our justice system that is perpetuating violence against survivors of rape, domestic violence and abuse. This is my part of many actions to call for an end to these injustices and to encourage survivors to speak out, to come together and for political reform of the justice system. 
In the photo you can see the top half of my old bikini ripped into pieces. I was wearing this bikini when I was raped by my ex boyfriend this time last year. The bottom half along with my sheets were taken by the police for forensic evidence. I went to get a medical examination but none of it was relevant and this evidence "wasn't enough" to disprove that he said it was consensual. I didn't consent. And so, it was one word against another. 
Not only this, but I suffered from ongoing abuse and harassment from the same person for 2 years! For more info on my story visit our Facebook Page.

Today is the day I let rip. I let rip the top half of my bikini as a sign of protest, empowerment, freedom and justice. Justice and a reform of the criminal justice system to PROTECT survivors of rape, domestic abuse and violence and other members of the public. 
I let rip to express my anger and as a way to signify now is the time to live my life in freedom and safety. To empower myself and others. I ask you to join me. To let rip and to let go. To own and to share. Hundreds of men, women and children die EVERY YEAR from abuse and there needs to be better protection, support and safety from our government! 
Today is the day I start anew in safety, taking actions for change and I encourage you to do the same.

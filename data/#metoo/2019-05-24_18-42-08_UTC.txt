The Trump-Pence Administration continues to promote policies that make it harder to prevent pregnancy, near impossible to get an abortion and difficult to raise a child in a safe, affordable environment. Looking at unplanned pregnancies, the rate is five times higher among poor women. Lack of access to effective birth control due to cost, proximity to doctors and transportation is a big contributor. And these issues disproportionately affect people of color. This is why it is so important for reproductive care to be covered by insurance.  We need to make sure everyone in the US, no matter their income, legal status, race or sexuality, has access to safe, legal, and affordable reproductive healthcare.

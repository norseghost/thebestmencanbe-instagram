The community of individuals with disabilities is making waves in the work place and this impact is going to be felt for generations to come! It is estimated that 1.3 billion people with disabilities are the new emerging market - that number is the size of China! 
According to writer Denise Brody, "the rise of people with disabilities isn’t just a numbers issue. It’s a generational one. This new workforce—Millennials and Gen-Z—could not be more different in their approach to tackling mental health and disabilities. They are energized by the power of the LGBTQ community, Black Lives Matter and the #MeToo movement—all similarly able to impact public opinion and raise awareness of their community and relevant issues. People with disabilities have always voiced their concerns, but this time it feels different." We are grateful to be able to provide a platform for the people UCPLA serves to participate in this movement and make an impact in their communities!

I just want to take the time to thank each and EVERY one of you for supporting us in supporting women, trans, and non-binary folk in this fight for reproductive rights. â€¢

We have no raised over $600 in total profit and will be making our second $300 donation tonight. This time we have decided to donate $150 each to the ACLU and Planned Parenthood to help in their lawsuits in states passing these draconian laws. 
At times, I feel so completely helpless but this community has shown me how many people are out there ready to fightâ€”and are already fighting. â€¢

Creating an online shop, website, and content all for charity is an incredible feeling but takes a lot of time and effort. If you love and support the work Iâ€™m doing, please consider purchasing merchandise to help fuel this feministâ€™s agenda. You can access our merch through our website (viewed better on a desktop). â€¢

All the shirts from our Facebook/Amazon shop are ALL still going to charity so no worries there! Only the money made from the Redbubble shop will go towards website development and content creation. Thank you for this constant love and support. ðŸ§ âœ¨

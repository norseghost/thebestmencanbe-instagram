“Do you want to talk about it or be distracted from it?” Is honestly the best thing you can say when someone says they are in sad or in pain.

Also may I add: “Do you want advice or do you just want to vent?” Is also a good thing to add because often unsolicited advice can further hurt someone who really just wanted a listening ear.

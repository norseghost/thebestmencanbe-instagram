Y’all this is a question I get asked all the time. Living a healthy lifestyle is a lot easier when you’re sitting at home all day and have plenty of time to meal plan, get groceries, and prepare your own food. ⠀
⠀
But what about when you’re traveling or life just gets really busy? ⠀
⠀
Here’s my key tip: don’t overcomplicate things! Make it a priority and set aside time to cut up your fresh fruits and veggies to make them easy to grab and go. Raw organic nuts, dates, figs, fruit, and grass-fed jerky are all great to have on hand when you need a snack that doesn’t need to be prepped. ⠀
⠀
Or single-sized servings of organic guac and hummus. So yummy and great for on-the-go! ⠀
⠀
I also plan ahead when I’m traveling and find healthy places near where I’m staying to either eat out or grab groceries. It allows me to NOT STRESS about what I’m eating. And that is one of the most important things, people! Can I get an AMEN?!⠀
⠀
If you have any healthy go-tos, I’d love it if you’d share them in the comments!

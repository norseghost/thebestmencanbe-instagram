Welcome to my art page! Sorry that I have not posted anything in the past few months, but I will try my best to post regularly. 
This self portrait artwork is a 6-foot canvas painting, and it was my first time using oil paint. I was inspired by Margeret Atwood novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," and how that parallels to current day feminist issues such as the #metoo movement.
Stay tuned for more updates on other works!

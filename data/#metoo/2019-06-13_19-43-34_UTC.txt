GLOW Season 2 was all about the show within the show and what it was like to make a TV series in 1985. We visited (created) a lot of spaces throughout the 2nd season, in addition to redressing our gym and hotel. Some of our new sets included a period mall, editing bays, a gay club, a performance space, a movie theatre, Bash’s childhood home, a 1985 Television Trade Show, a punk club, Sam’ s house, Debbie’s house, KDTV  offices, a strip club, the set of Cherry’s detective show, a local radio station, a hospital, a wedding in the ring, a TV executive’s #metoo cottage, a few vintage commercials, and several sketch comedy sets for our characters’ variety show in episode 8. Here’s a sampling for Emmy consideration - please think of us during voting - and our brilliant writers, directors, performers, cinematography, stunts, hair, makeup, and costumes 💅🏾✨ #glownetflix #fyc #glowseason2 #emmys #bestcomedy

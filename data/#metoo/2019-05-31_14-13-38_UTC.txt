I had #TWINS! My 2-part radio series on #SexEd FINALLY aired this week after working on it for 9mos ðŸ¤— Cringe-binged lots of vintage Sex Ed school films, got lost in #data, spoke to so many incredible people (half who didn't make it in), amplified the voices of #WomenOfColor & #Queer folks, incidentally created a great sexy soundtrack (ðŸ™Œ) & had many sleepless nights to bring you these stories. I'm so tired but so happy :) A decade ago I started a sexual health blog (kept up with it for 4yrs) because I believe in the importance & effectiveness of sex ed, especially coming from a culture that is known for having lots of unplanned kids & thinks homosexuality is bad. #ComprehensiveSexEd doesn't just teach you #SafeSex, it teaches communication skills. If you can speak up in the bedroom, then you can speak up in the boardroom & call out shit like #SexualHarassment at work, as exemplified by #MeToo movement--or simply learn not to do it. Can't believe I got to do my 1st radio features on the topic. Best bday present I could've given myself ðŸ˜Š Link in Bio.

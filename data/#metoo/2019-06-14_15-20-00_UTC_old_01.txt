Today is a great day for some sweet treats and or slush like happenings. One of the few people who been very solid throughout my adventure is opening his own snackery venue on 11th and Turner. If you get the chance go visit Pepe and support local, let's see the young business thrive out here. Man's a great chef as well, but branching out into his own entrepreneurship. Always a good dude lookin out for others and proud to see him making moves out here. #supportlocal #pepes #freepress #metoo #blacklivesmatter #waterprotectors #fullmenunotposted

i am in the midst of figuring out life without most of my family; such as my mother and her family. how do i navigate the question “how are you?” The day to day reveals i’m well on the outside, but i am in so much pain on the inside. i feel complete abandonment by my family. since i share random snippets of my good life on social media, why shouldn’t i share the struggles and hurt? recently i announced my experience of sexual abuse for years from a family member and i have never felt more free. how is it possible to feel so free yet so abandoned simultaneously? people may not ask or share often what they need, but i need your love, your comfort, and your support. i promise to give you the same.

On June 21st, OWV is hosting our annual fundraising event BREAKING THE SILENCE ‚Äî a conversation on oppression and violence against women. OWV has always been and will always be about reclaiming our voice and unapologetically sharing our experiences with eachother. This event is extremely special because it‚Äôs on National Indigenous Day and we‚Äôre celebrating Indigenous storytelling featuring some of the most amazing Indigenous woman-identifying artists in Toronto! We‚Äôre ending off with an OPEN MIC for all the women and femmes to speak their shit and be loud about it! Tickets are in our bio ‚Äî proceeds go towards supporting local woman artists and entrepreneurs in July.ü•≥‚ù§Ô∏è tell a friend to tell a friend! #ourwomensvoices

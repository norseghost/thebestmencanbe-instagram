I despised being a girl\ud83e\udd2e, I saw it as a weakness & felt vulnerable\ud83d\ude14. At some point, I actually thought I was a boy. My mother had to call me Peter when calling me in for dinner from the park because I had told everyone that was my name\ud83d\ude05\n\nAs I grew, it did become problematic\ud83d\ude25People would ask me if I was a boy or a girl as they laughed at me. The boys I crushed on never liked me back & saw me as one of the guys. I wished I could be like the girls they admired...I felt fundamentally flawed\ud83d\ude2b. I wished I was normal & could fit in, but I couldn\u2019t\ud83e\udd7a\n\nUntil this day, you won\u2019t catch me with a dress on & Im still very Tomboyish. But today, I\u2019m proud of who I am\ud83d\ude00 & if someone doesn\u2019t love me the way I am, they can go...you know where\ud83d\ude0f\n\nI know I\u2019m not the only survivor effected by the abuse in this way, there are many of us. It\u2019s a normal reaction to what has happened to us & we should never be ashamed of it. I accept myself the way I am\u270a...& so should you\ud83d\udc4c\n\nKnow that you are beautiful just the way you are\u2764\ufe0f\n#gender #genderidentity #tomboy  #childsexualabuse #trauma #cptsd #signsandsymptoms #repercussions #abuse #childabuse #identity #adverseeffects #girl #boy #goodtoknow #youarenotalone #metoo #selfacceptance #selflove  #mywords #mylife #mystory"

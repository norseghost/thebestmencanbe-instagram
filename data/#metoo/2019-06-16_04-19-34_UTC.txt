Thank you all that came out tonight to support me in sharing about my past abusive marriage. It definitely wasn’t easy but it was much needed not to uplift other woman but to free myself and shed another layer of my old self off. If it wasn’t for my decision to leave that relationship I would have never meet this man next to me. I always say and truly mean he was my life saver because without him and the facility and opportunity he shared with me I wouldn’t be here breathing and alive. I would have ended my own life because of not feeling like I was worth anything, wasn’t valuable, wasn’t wanted, wasn’t loved, and wasn’t going to overcome this darkness. Everything is aligned weather you think so or not. Thank you my love, I am truly blessed to be sharing this life with you♥️

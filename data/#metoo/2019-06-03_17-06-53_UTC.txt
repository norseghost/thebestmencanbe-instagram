PEACH Writes (link in the bio) 
AN OPEN LETTER TO @lilyallen
The idea came whilst I was reading "My thoughts exactly", Lily Allen's first book. It shook me with truth, sensitivity and a kind of strenght that cannot be ignored, a trully inspiring way of not bullshitting ourselves in things we got wrong and how we got better, how we try, how we fail, how we do it all over again. 
This letter to @lilyallen aims at showing how artists can connect, how women can fell towards each other and how close we finally are in our lives as vulnerable beings and how our existences respond to each other. 
I decided to write this letter and to publish it because I really do think that Lily Allen's music and her universe is understated, underknown, and I think it's time I bring my little piece to the table in order to help her spread her message. 
This text talks about art, music, womanness, writing, sexual violence, sex, harassment in the entertainement industry, feminist complexities and empathy. My words aim at sharing love, understanding and some informations. 
I hope you'll like it. Lily, if you come by here, Hello 🏳️‍🌈🙏🔥 .... . #lilyallen #openletter #mythoughtsexactly #women #makingbridges #feelings #honnesty #letter #journalism #peachjournal #artist #womenwhowrite #womenwhodostuff #womeninmusic #musicindustry #singer #metoo #timeisup #stopthebullshit #creating #london #noshame

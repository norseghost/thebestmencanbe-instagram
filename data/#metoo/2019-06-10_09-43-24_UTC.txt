Digital catcalling is a new problem with all the same old issues. Normally, delete, block, forget, but this person made it as a comment on someone else's post. I tried blocking, and the comment went away (for me) my girlfriend looked and though I couldn't see it, the comment was still there.

I have students who see these posts about me (though they're not supposed to) and what am I telling them if I let it stand. I am, by inaction, suggesting to my young female students that their objectification is ok, I'm, by my silence, suggesting to my young male students that toxic speech is just fine, as long as it comes in the form of a "compliment" or "joke".

I am not about to let that be the lesson they learn!

But after learning from my own experiences I can say that there's some truth in it.\nAccording to me, it's like 60-40.\nYes, women are their worst enemy and a greatest cheerleader too.\n\nWe all know that women are sensitive & highly complex human being. They can eat, read, watch movies and at the same time can plan for their next day. Thats how they function\ud83d\ude01.\nThere mind never sleeps\ud83d\udc7b\ud83e\udd13.\n.\nWe are our own enemy because we're too obsessed & jealous of our own people. We badmouth, gossip, we compare, we compete, we demean our own people verbally more than men.\n\nBeing a women itself, we question other women's character and upbringing\nWhy? \nBecause we can't see them flourish professionally or personally, living better lifestyle.\n\nWe constantly compare & crictisize another women on clothes, makeup & what not.\nWe call them slut, bitches without giving a thought.\nReason we're very much insecure about our ownself.\n--------\nNow comes another 40% women, who're Alphawomen.\nOne who's not cocky but confident\nOne who supports another women.\nOne who rise by lifting others.\nOne who's independent & unapologetically loyal to her Tribe.\nShe knows how to love & respect.\nShe intimidates insecurity and mediocrity.\n\nBeing a alpha women, my only message to conventional women is you can never rise by putting other women down. You can never lead a happy life with your insecure & jealous behaviour.\n\nAfter #metoo movement even men had learn to a great extent on how to treat women with respect. But when will you learn the same.\n\nBreak your dimensions!\nGrow up!\nWe have to come together if we want to make a difference in society.\nStop being each other\u2019s worst enemies.\nLove, respect & assist one other.\nBe like a ALPHAWOMEN\ud83d\udcaa\nStrong & Loyal\ud83d\udcaa\n.\n#writersofindia#writersofinstagram#wordstoliveby#writer#writing#motivationalspeaker#speaker#womenempowerment#l4l#likers#likeforlikes#follow#followforfollow#f4f#wordsofwisdom#wordsmith#influencer#indianwriters#feminist#workingtogethe#beauty#writerscommunity#nature#lifecoach#creativewriting#selfworth#wordporn#igwriters"

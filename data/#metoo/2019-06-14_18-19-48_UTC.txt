In August 2014 I went back to #serverlife as a #sidehustle with a restaurant group I believed to be green and like-minded so I could pursue 
#freelancework for awesome #greenbusinesses like @communitycompostco and #beapartofthesolution. On my #shadowshift at their #washingtonsquareparknyc location I recognized 2 things: 1. I wanted to know the person, Brett Crandall from KS, training me forever and and my new employer may NOT be as green as their advertising 😢 It would take 3 more years filled with #hittingtheglassceiling #metoo #substancedependency #innumerableexamples and then #breakingasahumanbeing for my brain 🧠 and my heart ❤️ to catch up with what my gut immediately picked up on. Thanks to my family, friends, mentors, artists and angles I’m #outofthedarkness and so grateful and excited to watch Brett’s and all the other artists @playchellafestival shine their light and bring others out of the darkness! All are welcome so join us! #wereherewerequeerwerepuppeteers #pride #loveislove #liveyourlight #shineyourlight #greenwashingsucks #greenwashing #listentoyourgut #thankyouforthesuffering @dirtylaundrytheatre @j.caress.studio @bassginger @feltleftout @ace1no @panooc @headcountorg @jacklynn.hyde @petrafriedpresents @vegasgvalentine @imsandrab @jake_howard_im_fine @silvanacarranzaactor @luisalyons @hollandlanecurtis @sarajdove @harley_ann_kulp @thewellbrooklyn #holdtrue #millerlitelife

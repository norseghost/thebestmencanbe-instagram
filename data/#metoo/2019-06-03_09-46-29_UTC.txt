The weather was extremely beautiful, so I decided to go to the beach to shoot some content. I went to a familiar place because I was all by myself and just wanted to get some shots. After a few minutes a nude man walked up to me and placed his stuff on the same dune as me. I wasn’t intimidated by the fact that he was naked, we where at the beach after all, but I could feel his eyes watching every move I made. While I was getting very uncomfortable, I moved a bit, and with every move this man moved with me..

Shortly after that I could hear him coming closer from behind. He placed his hand on his hip and he asked: ‘I photo’ & ‘I Look’ several times. As a girl, on my own I felt very intimidated by him, as he kept asking and getting closer towards me. My body language told him no, I shakes my head ‘no’ and told him no. But he kept pushing.

So I moved. I got scared but I came with a purpose and I wanted to get the job done. Drank some water and pulled myself together. But the man kept moving too, I could see him moving his towel, walking around the dunes facing me and he would show up in the background when I checked my pictures.

Later another man walked towards me. Asking me what I was doing and why I was making erotic pictures all by myself (and how I dared to do this). I started a conversation but it didn’t matter, I felt uncomfortable and decided to leave.

I’m so upset that a man can enter your comfort zone without a warning. How they can turn a safe place into a scary place. I love nature but I always make sure I’m near a busy road while I’m on my own, just in case something happens. It makes me angry that I can travel the whole world and that it’s in my own country where I feel most vulnerable. Because I was at a freaking beach and I wasn’t even wearing my bikini.

It’s not the first time that things like this happen (the nude was a first though) and it’s crazy to think that your almost getting used to it. As a woman it should be safe to wander around, to go to the beach by myself, to go to the city by myself or to go to a forest by myself. Day and night. Period.

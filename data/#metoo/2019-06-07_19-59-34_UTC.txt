“States have obligation to respect, protect and fulfill women’s rights related to abortion services”- this is what the @UN believes about abortion policies. As the Alabama anti-abortion bill passed just last month, the UN stresses the importance in supporting legalized abortion. Pregnancy is not always simple; it may be unexpected, some women may not have enough financial ability to raise a child or it may cause unexpected harm to the woman’s body, or there may be many other issues which come along with pregnancy. Therefore, some women need the option of “abortion”. It is imperative to provide legal and safe access to abortion for the right of all women, as well as with guaranteeing them with post-abortion medical support as well. •

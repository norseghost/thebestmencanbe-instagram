White Supremacy and sexual assault interact on a frequent level. For example, the police department not trying very hard to solve, and disbelieving, Jewish, Black, and other minority victims about being assaulted in the circumstances that they’d be more empathetic towards and likely to believe a white victim. Often because minorities are seen as more dramatic and capable of dealing with trauma than white victims, this is DAMAGING. I’m at the point after where I don’t have the energy to do much. I’m being hit with depression that makes it hurt to breathe [also damage to my diaphragm]. I’m terrified, dealing with being re-traumatized, and reached the point where I am too scared to leave my home. My social media’s have for the most part been taken down. I can’t be alone for more than a few hours without having a panic attack, not at all at night [I was home alone when it happened]. I’m crying at like everything. I absolutely hate feeling so emotionally vulnerable. It’s been 3 weeks since the attack and nothing has healed.

If you haven’t been sexually assaulted, stop telling those of us that have been to buck up, when you stumble get back up and be strong, etc. You don’t know what it’s like. If you’ve never been assaulted as a hate crime, that fear is even deeper, it’s different. Until your entire world comes crashing down and burns and you have to watch people rejoice in the flames while exclaiming how HAPPY they are that “your people” were hurt, you don’t know how we feel.

My point is this: It is IMPERATIVE to start and open the discussion about how these things intersect, and it’s an important conversation to have, because for many victims, they need this kind of discussion to be opened to be able to start healing.

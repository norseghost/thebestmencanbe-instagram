The young women turned toward Anna with a sense of dread and pity, not knowing if the murder had something to do with redheads, models or just females. “Oh, dear,” was all Anna could muster. “Poor girl,” Natasha said. “She came from nothing really. But she desperately wanted to be a model. She told Jo and me that she just packed her bags and took a train to NYC. Unfortunately, she ended up renting a place in a bad area of the city. It wasn’t until after she had lived there for a few months that she came to see us in the hopes of joining our agency. Jo and I immediately loved her look and were so excited about sending her out to meet potential clients. Sadly though, we never got the chance. She was murdered less than a week later.”

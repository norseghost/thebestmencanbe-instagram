I've always had issues with it, I've often felt so trapped in this body that didn't work. I've had chondromalisia from a young age, panic attacks, low blood sugar, interstitial cystitis, chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, tendinitis. My body has rarely felt like a capable vessel for sport. I'd tell it to move, to please work with me this time, pleading, and my knees would collapse. On the Camino I learned to listen to my body, that every time I ignored it it would yell and ache and scream even louder than before, the sound reverberating in my bones. I learned I need to have a conversation with it every morning and every night, ask it \"How are you my love? Would you like some tea or water?\", to hold it when tears leak from its eyes, rest it when its joints ache, calm it when it shakes in anticipation of a danger that isn't coming. I had almost learned to love it, but I still didn't quite see it for what it was. I could find no practical use for the cage of a body I was gifted so its use became its beauty. I needed to be skinny, that is how my body could serve me once and for all. My lack of fat was my ticket to happiness and with every pound I gained my ticket dissolved in the wind. But this year my body has been more than a skeleton or a cage, I've loved it, and I've nearly cried of joy in the moments I've felt it dance on the rock. My arms have held every ounce of me on one twist of the fist in a granite crack. My feet have found purchase on rocks the size of a pin and not fallen under my weight. Along side fellow climbers, different bodies with the same goal, I've learned to appreciate my body for what it can do. My arms are long, all the better for reaching holds. My hands large, all the better for jamming, and my fingers skinny, able (rest in comments)"

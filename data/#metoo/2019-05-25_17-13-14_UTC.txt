Continuing our tour of amazing museum-worthy shows in the Madison Avenue galleries, all eyes hungry for a great challenge must move through the doors of the esteemed Mnuchin Gallery for the De Kooning exhibition drawn from over 3 decades of his artistic practice. WOW!
Okay, this first set is an ode to the works on paper from the early 1950s, and one big painting Woman 111 from 1952-53, seemingly appropriate for this #metoo #youtoo socially aware emotional climate.  Childlike and skeletal and confrontational. “The landscape is in the Woman and there is Woman in the landscapes.” #willemdekooning #womanempowerment #keeplooking #dekooningwoman #mnuchingallery

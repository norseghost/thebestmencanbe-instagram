Repost from @heal_your_trauma and time to get real. At first I didn’t want to go to therapy but my school counselor and mom made me go. I had a lot of issues at first and it took me a long time to truly share everything with her. But honestly, you get out what you put into it and know that it’s okay if it takes a while and you can go at your own pace, but therapy does help. -Rissy

There are some amazing people posting on Instagram. Two being @_megconley & @lifeinahmadsdays who both posted two very different but valid viewpoints on the second pic here. The man came to throw himself off the bridge but was prevented from doing so by the crowd who held on to him. When you look at the pic, who do you find yourself empathizing more with - the man or the crowd?  In Meg's post, I empathized with the crowd and admired the spontaneous collective love they had for this desperate stranger. But in Ahmad's post, I found myself empathizing with the desperate man and asking where all this support was before? Why did this man have to attempt to jump before we were there for him? Please visit Meg's & Ahmad's feeds to read their comments. I genuinely believe people are amazing. There is so much beauty and love in each one of us. But I do also think that as a society we are becoming more and more afraid to listen to each other. Which is so sad when you think how our most basic desire is simply to be heard and understood.

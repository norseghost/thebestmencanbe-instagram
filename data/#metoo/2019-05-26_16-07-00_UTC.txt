Sometimes it’s difficult for me to smile genuinely. This might sound exaggerated but, it almost feels like a job to make myself smile when I’m not in the mood. I decided that walking around with a straight face all day and being negative wasn’t going to bring me happiness. That’s why I’ve been smiling more lately; I feel better and it’s actually great for your health. Smiling and laughter have been proven to relieve stress and boost your mood! It makes me so upset that some women and men never smile in real life/ pictures with their teeth. Stop showing us those half smiles and embrace your beauty. No smile should ever be hidden 😁. Your smile is unique to you, show it off as much as possible.

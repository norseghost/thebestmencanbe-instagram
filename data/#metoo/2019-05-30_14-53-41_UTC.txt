“I have been working in the area of leadership development and organizational culture for about 19 years and diversity and inclusion has been an integral part of it. I am an independent consultant for several corporate firms. While my consulting practice helps me to work on one of the burning issues in today’s society (sexual harassment at the workplace) it is also emotionally and physically exhausting. I travel to several locations, sometimes remote, and take part in the investigation to ensure the process follows the legal guidelines in letter and spirit. The rewards of my work have come in most unlikely ways. As people often have to open up to me about very personal incidents, they form an emotional bond and a sense of trust. Some have still stayed in touch. Such real connections formed with people coming from different verticals, background and industry have definitely been the biggest highlight for me.

I am glad about conversations happening around sexual harassment at the workplace. However, we need to dig deeper and jump onto precautionary bandwagon instead of just cures. Sexual harassment is never okay. As long as people think it is even slightly okay, it will continue and never end. Though the #MeToo movement has definitely shaken the dust off there’s still much more to be done. Don’t settle or bear disrespect in any form. Build skills to express yourself firmly yet respectfully, when you experience unwelcome behaviour. Do not assume they know that you do not.” Arti is a registered Career guide on ‘The star in me’ platform.

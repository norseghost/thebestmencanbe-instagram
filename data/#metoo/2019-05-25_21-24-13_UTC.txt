Empathy isn’t just something that happens to us, it’s also a choice we make: to pay attention, to extend ourselves. It’s made of exertion. Sometimes we care for another because we know we should, or because it’s asked for, but this does not make our caring hollow. The act of choosing simply means we have committed ourselves to a set of behaviors greater than the sum of our individual inclinations: I will listen to his sadness, even when I’m deep in my own.

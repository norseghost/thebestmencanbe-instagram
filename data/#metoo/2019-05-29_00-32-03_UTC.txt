We now know that childhood sexual abuse that is suppressed will often begin to filter out some 30 years later.  During this time, the suppressed abuse will manifest itself in numerous ways albeit through addictions, dysfunctional relationships including domestic violence and other health related issues.  Surely, educating our children has to be a better way of dealing with sexual abuse - particularly intra-familial sexual abuse or incest as most people would know it?  If we can educate our children about what sexual abuse is and the dangers of suppressing it, we will create an environment where disclosure begins to be that much easier.  Please, educate your children ❤️ #childsexualabuse #childabuse #childabuseawareness #childsexualabuseawareness #domesticviolence #domesticabuse #domesticabuseawareness #eatingdisorderrecovery #eatingdisorderawareness #singlemum #singlemom #parenting #parentingtips #singledad #education #teachersofinstagram #teachers #timesup #metoo #psychology #counselling

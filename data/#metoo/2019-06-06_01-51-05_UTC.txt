12 years ago I signed up to start training for my first marathon. I was in a really dark, lonely place and running became the first healthy decision I made for myself in a couple years. Running brought a series of other things into my life I never could have predicted - discipline, incredible friendships, nutritional awareness, fun travel, a platform to raise money for causes I am passionate about, deep gratitude for being able-bodied, and ultimately a relationship with God.

26.2 miles of San Francisco hills humbled me in new ways, leaving me to clearly see my need for something greater than myself. God not only met me on those hills, but continued to meet me mile after mile in the months and years that followed as I continued to lace up my sneakers.

It’s hard to put to words what running has done for me - physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Running has strengthened me. Running has empowered me. Running has helped me address mental health struggles. Running has quite literally saved my life. And so I continue to run in hopes that it will save others lives as well.

A run has never returned me exactly the same. I go, I grow. I pray it does the same for you. Happy Global Running Day!

“There is something magical about running; after a certain distance, it transcends the body. Then a bit further, it transcends the mind. A bit further yet, and what you have before you, laid bare, is the soul.” K. Armstrong

This is a promise to myself. X 
I refuse to take part in anything that I know will not serve me in the long run. 
I refuse to give my time or energy to anything that I know will not teach me.

I refuse to let myself make the same old choices that I know will lead me to the same disappointment. 
And most importantly- 
I refuse to pretend to be anything other than what I am in order to please or entertain ANYONE else. 
I am enough. I have always been enough. 
And from now on, I will choose myself. ðŸ’›ðŸ’›ðŸ’› .

As we've been discussing, in the making of a victim, the cycle of abuse continues for several reasons. Yet another reason is the fact that we, as parents, miss the signs. As the parents of a child sex abuse survivor, we can tell you that we definitely missed the signs as well.
In the case of Jeannie Mai, she recalls that her abuse extended over the course of several years and she says "I remember getting quieter, and I started getting nightmares". She went on to say she felt she and her mother drifted apart. Once she found the courage to speak, she says "I tried to tell  you. I told you I don't like this person and I don't want to stay home with him anymore. Please stay home with me."
Her mother mistook her plea as kids being kids and just not getting along. When in fact, it was a desperate cry for help.
These are the very signs that we missed as well, and it is because parents aren't looking for the abuser to be in our own family! We simply assume family members and close friends are safe contacts and we don't take the time to learn about patterns and cycles of abuse. Because, we are adamant that our family members can't be capable of such heinous behavior. This is exactly what the abuser needs you to believe and this is why they can molest undetected for years!
Parents please listen to what your kids are saying and not saying. Take note of behavior changes and moods. Take the time to learn about predatory behavior and the signs of abuse. We say this with love and concern - these predators thrive on our ignorance!Tomorrow we will talk about the worst thing that you can say to a victim. **SEE FULL VIDEO HERE OR ON OUR FACEBOOK PAGE**** https://youtu.be/oAU_3WRnvkY

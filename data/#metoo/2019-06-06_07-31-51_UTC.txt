Ruby Howell, 70, lost her job with Kampgrounds of America after video of the confrontation at Mississippi’s Oktibbeha County Lake went viral. In the video, Howell holds a gun as she talks to Jessica and Franklin Richardson, who had been attempting to have a picnic. The couple didn't know they needed a reservation at the campground to sit by the lake. Howell has been charged with a misdemeanor count of threatening exhibition of a weapon.

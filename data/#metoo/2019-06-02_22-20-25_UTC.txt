PTSD Progress update #1

So as most of you know from my post a few days ago, I've been working hard to make progress with my ptsd. I rented and watched the movie that has been a HUGE trigger because it's the earliest time of my sexual abuse i remember vividly.  Thanks to support from my safe people, i made it through. I'm not going to lie, its HARD. Things are clicking though, he's not here, he can't hurt me, he doesn't get to control the way i feel. 
For the first time i took a shower without taking what i call a "survivor shower" i showered, i didn't scrub, i didn't rush. I just sat on my shower chair and enojyed my shower. 
I'm here, that might sound weird but I'm finally present. I'm not using my phone to distract myself, I'm not zoning out. I'm having conversations, I'm paying attention, I'm learning new things, I'm finally appreciating the beauty in life. Anyone who knows me well knows that this is huge progress.

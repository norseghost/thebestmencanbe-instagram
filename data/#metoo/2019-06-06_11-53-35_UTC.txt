repost • @ajplus Yumi Ishikawa, a Japanese writer and actress, launched the #KuToo campaign after being forced to wear high heels for a part-time job at a funeral parlor. A Tweet about her experience circulated widely online, prompting her to launch the campaign. ⁣
⁣
The name, KuToo, is a play on the words "kutsu" (shoes) and "kutsuu" (pain). It is also a pun on #MeToo, which is symbolic of the global movement against sexual harassment. ⁣
⁣
Nearly 20,000 women have signed an online petition calling on Japan's government to ban companies from requiring female employees to wear high heels on the job. Although a de facto requirement, campaigners say it is considered obligatory in many Japanese companies.⁣
⁣
Long-term use of high heels can cause bunions, lower back pain, and weaken ankle muscles. Japan ranks 110 out of 149 countries in the World Economic Forum's gender-equality ranking.⁣

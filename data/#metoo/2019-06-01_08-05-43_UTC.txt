A federal lawsuit filed in California in April 2016 against #JeffreyEpstein and #DonaldTrump by a California woman alleged the men sexually assaulted her at a series of parties at Epstein's Manhattan home in 1994, when she was 13 years of age. The suit was dismissed by a federal judge in May 2016 because it didn't raise valid claims under federal #law . The woman filed another federal suit in New York in June 2016, but it was withdrawn 3 months later, apparently without being served on the defendants. A third federal suit was filed in New York in September 2016. The 2 latter suits included affidavits by an anonymous witness who attested to the accusations in the suits, and an anonymous person who declared the plaintiff had told him/her about the assaults at the time they occurred. The plaintiff, who had filed anonymously as Jane Doe, was scheduled to appear in a Los Angeles press conference six days before the 2016 election, but abruptly canceled the event; her lawyer Lisa Bloom asserted the woman had received threats. The suit was dropped on November 4, 2016. Trump attorney Alan Garten flatly denied the allegations, while Epstein declined to comment. In January 2015, a 31-year-old American woman, Virginia Roberts, alleged in a sworn affidavit that at the age of 17 she had been held as a sex slave by Epstein. She further alleged that he had trafficked her to several people, including #PrinceAndrew and Harvard Law professor #AlanDershowitz . Roberts also claimed that Epstein and others had physically and sexually abused her. Roberts alleged that the #FBI may have been involved in a #coverup . She said she had served as Epstein's sex slave from 1999 to 2002 and had recruited other under-age girls. Epstein entered an out-of-court settlement. Source: Wikipedia

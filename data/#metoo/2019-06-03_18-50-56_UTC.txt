New Moon New Womb! 
So a couple months ago I stumbled upon @thekristengarro and she talked about womb healing. I knew immediately that I needed that. 
What she did was help me cut ties of the sexual trauma I experienced making my womb very scared, having sexual partners for all the wrong reasons that didnâ€™t make my womb feel safe, miscarriage that definitely made my womb extremely numb and completely turned off, and 3 births that had trauma after each. 
Donâ€™t get me wrong at some points with some people cutting those ties was hard. Not because they did anything wrong but because the connection was so strong. The person I experienced sex with for the first time which I definitely cherish, a love I had for years that was such a bonding and loving time and even my husband who yes we have experienced negative things in our marriage and worked through them but still had stagnant energy. 
It was reclamation of me and my body. Only allowing myself to honor myself. Giving power back to my most sacred space. It was powerful it was amazing. I could feel the stagnant energy leaving, I could see all those I cut ties with, I could see the repairs being made. 
I said I was so deeply sorry for the choices I made out of lack and that from now on no more pain and nothing to fear. She has her space ready to take charge and stand in her power. Thank you Kristen for this amazing experience. 
If anyone is interested in a womb healing please reach out  to her she is amazing. ðŸ’— #pussypower #girlpower #womenempowerment #metoo #goddess #spiritualmom #spiritualbabe #soul #soulcoach #soulfulwoman

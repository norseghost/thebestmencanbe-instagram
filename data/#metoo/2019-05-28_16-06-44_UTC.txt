Born in Santa Clara, Cuba, Nely Gal√°n is self-made media mogul. She was the first Latina President of Entertainment for a U.S. television network, Telemundo, an Emmy Award winning producer of over 700 television shows in English and Spanish, and the founder of The Adelante Movement to empower and train Latina and multicultural women entrepreneurs. Her entrepreneurship for women manifesto, SELF MADE, is a New York Times Best Selling book.

Disclosure: I am lucky to count Nely among my friends and colleagues. We developed a series together at Lifetime Television and ibwrote my novel THE HUSBAND HABIT on a retreat in her Santa Fe vacation home.

Her entrepreneurship began young, when she sold Avon in high school to pay her own Catholic school tuition. She asked the school to tell her prents it was a scholarship so their pride would not be effected. At age 17, she became the youngest editor ever hired by Seventeen magazine. She is one of the most brilliant and inspiring humans I know.

Learn more about her in my forthcoming book, KNOW US BY OUR NAMES: 100 INFLUENTIAL LATINAS WHO CHANGED THE WORLD, coming Sept. 23 from Eugenia Books.

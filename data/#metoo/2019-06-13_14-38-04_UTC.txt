This is why I am pro the 2nd Amendment and heavily encourage all women to embrace the Warrior path. Women need to become Warriors. You are your first line of defense. You must train your mind and body to become a force to be reckoned with.

Women must become strong in body and mind to defend themselves and their family. You must become the Warrior you’re meant to be.

All the stuff, the stories we have, the triggers we walk around with, the relationships that bring us suffering, the trauma we have experienced, these things do not have to define us.

We have choices, we have work to to, we have healing that is possible. What are you willing to face in order to bring your gifts to the world? What can you let go of for your highest good? What change is waiting for you to get out of your own way?

You were born to bring something only you can bring to the world. What is standing in your way?

Monday proved to be an inspiring day for a lucky group of young female professionals that attended HPW’s panel discussion titled "Empowering Women: The Power of our Voice". In the era of the #MeToo movement, the rules of the workplace are changing for women and men and our voice is even more powerful than ever. 
PN Lawyers Attorney Eleni Melekou was graciously asked to speak about the legal issues at play regarding sexual harassment in the workplace, alongside other notable women such as @deemanis (Executive VP Chief People Officer of S&P Global) and Honorable @aravellasimotas (NYS Assemblymember). The discussion was moderated by @vdiamataris (Online Features Editor at Ethnikos Kirikas & The National Herald) and @melagraf89 (Associate VP at Prosek Partners). A wonderful and intimate networking social followed the lively panel discussion.

Thank you to @hellenicprofwomen for inviting our team to be a part of this extremely important and necessary event.

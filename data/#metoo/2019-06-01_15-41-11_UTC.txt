Women Deliver 2019
Our Turn, Our Time, Our Life

So grateful and blessed to be attending this event, and what makes it more special, is that I will be attending with my daughter. 
We are all sisters. We are united and rising strong and now let's declare its OUR TURN, OUR TIME  OUR LIFE to rise into our unique greatness. We all have gifts, talents, and a voice that will make a difference if we feel safe and empowered to use it. There is strength in unity.  There is inspiration, motivation, encouragement, support and connection when we come together and embrace each other, learn from each other. 
This is why I get up in the morning. I do not want to see any woman or young girl short changed from living a life they are worthy and deserving of.

Ladies, It's our time to unlock our inner power, purpose and passion. .

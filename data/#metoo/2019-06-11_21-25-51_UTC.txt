‪@keanureeves I have to applaud you for this simple act!!! By merely NOT touching a woman while speaking to or taking a photo with you have spoken VOLUMES! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽. I am extremely uncomfortable by physical contact due to my assault. And I do ask men to remove their hands from my body because I did not give them permission to touch me!!! #metoo #keanureeves #2facesofanxiety #thereislightindarkness #mybodymyrules

I realized...\n.\nWhy I couldn\u2019t remember anything.\n.\nWhy I was always afraid someone would take advantage of me.\n.\nWhy I couldn\u2019t connect with other kids.\n.\nWhy id starve myself then eat everything in sight.\n.\nWhy I was raped two more times as an adult (Survivors tend to have repeat attacks throughout adolescence) and blamed myself. I didn\u2019t even call it rape... I just thought I brought it on myself.\n.\nWhy I rebelled and chose to ignore my illnesses, cut myself instead of seek help, feel disappointed every day I woke up again, why I\u2019d fight anyone who I loved out of fear they world hurt or leave me... why I never let myself get close to or trust adults - including my parents who just thought I was an angry person.\n.\nI was 4 when that monster first said to me, \u201cif you tell mommy and daddy they\u2019ll think you\u2019re disgusting too and leave you. You only have me.\u201d\n.\nI was 7 when I almost died. I hid being sick from my mom because she was pregnant and having a difficult time. I didn\u2019t want any attention.... to me, I didn\u2019t deserve any attention. I just needed to see my baby sister. So I hid being sick until I almost died... right after my baby sister was born and I was able to see her.\n.\nI was 7, so sick, and remember that monster making me pee in the street (I was in DKA and dying... I couldn\u2019t hold my pee any more) as he laughed at me and called me a dog as I cried. He abused me for another year and then I was safe... from him. What I didn\u2019t realize is how hard it would continue to make life until...\n.\nI was 28 when I decided to stop resenting my past and start valuing the strong woman, loving mother, and fierce protector of women that I was destined to become as a result...& he\u2019ll never take that away from me."

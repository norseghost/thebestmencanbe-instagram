I’m pissed and scared y’all. I think we should ALL be pissed and scared. What’s happening in our country right now is clearly a strategic attack on women’s rights. The recent actions of our government have proven that they won’t stop taking liberties with our bodies. We have to keep shouting. Look for a blog post coming soon, if you’re interested to hear my take on it. 
In a nutshell- I will always support your right to be anti-abortion, all I ask is that women retain the right to CHOOSE. Abortion has existed as long as pregnancy has. The attack that has been launched on Roe v Wade aims to send women back to the days of poison and coat hangers. 
Don’t be fooled, this is not about life, this is about control
Fight sisters (and brothers, we need you as allies more than ever)

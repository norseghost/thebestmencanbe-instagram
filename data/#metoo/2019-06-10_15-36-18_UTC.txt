This is the story of Kate, an affable, ambitious, young woman who gets raped by a relative of her best friend. Her ambition, vivaciousness and trust in people subsequently unravels. She wrestles with how to tell her mum, how to have a relationship and most importantly how she discusses it with her best friend. The relationships in this novel are fascinating and the point that she finds someone who has been through what she has and gets that support, I genuinely want to hug her. I am grateful for something like this that will help people get a bit of an insight into how those who have been abused may feel and how they can talk about it. It’s OK not to be OK.

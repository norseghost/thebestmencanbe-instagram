Meg Wolitzerâ€™s The Female Persuasion lays bare the complexities of being a feminist in the modern day. Greer is at college when her feminist awakening begins, sparked by an incident of sexual assault and escalated by a talk from Faith Frank, a prominent feminist. As Greer moves into the wider world and begins working for Faith, however, she learns that feminist thought and feminist action do not always go hand in hand. In her efforts to bring about equality for all, her relationships come into question, and she is forced to reconcile the selfishness of her personal actions with the generosity of her professional activities. Wolitzer intelligently taps into the complications that accompany contemporary feminism, in a way that will make you question your own stances, and the way in which you put those thoughts into positive action.  #bookstagram #wolitzer #megwolitzer #thefemalepersuasion #feminist #feminism #metoo

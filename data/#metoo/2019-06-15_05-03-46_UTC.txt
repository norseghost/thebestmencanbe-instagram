At times I find myself myself more haunted ⁣
by the trauma I’ve witnessed, ⁣
than the trauma I’ve endured. ⁣
⁣
There are times when I close my eyes ⁣
and vividly still see the bruises on their body, ⁣
the fear in their eyes. ⁣
⁣
_⁣
⁣
And they can explain away their sins to ⁣
those with feeble hearts, ⁣
but I will never forget how he touched her. ⁣
How he deemed his anger more worthy ⁣
than her strength of heart. ⁣
⁣
For I carry the weight of every harsh word ⁣
and firm grip under the first layer of my skin. ⁣
It remains as an armour to protect myself, ⁣
and those I love from men like you, ⁣
who use smooth words to cover the actions ⁣
of their forceful hands.⁣
⁣

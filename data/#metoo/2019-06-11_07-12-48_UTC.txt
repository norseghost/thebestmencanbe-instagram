the first time i'd been kissed, it was labeled an 'accident'.
"i was aiming for your cheek", he'd said
as he pressed me further into the wall
and silenced my 'no' with his teeth.

he made seeing the good in people so fucking hard.
i'm wrapped up in the ghost of my past
watching him undress me every chance he finds.
"you're my doll", he says.
even dolls don't deserve this.

they tell me all men are not monsters
and i find it so hard to believe.
the one man i let into my life
put those monsters to shame.

so forgive me if i don't react
when you say i'm gonna be okay
the only voices i hear
are of the demons inside my head.

when the clock strikes midnight
my body starts convulsing.
they test me for drugs
but it's pain i'm withdrawing from.

my screams bounce off the blinds that cover the windows
daring the moonlight to peek through.
they're coming at me again.
sedatives scare me.
if they told me i won't wake up tomorrow,
i'd fall asleep just fine.

they don't understand what's wrong with me.
i'm here.
but my soul
is trapped inside the cage
he built around my body.

they rescued me from one prison,
and thrust me into another.
'case 257a' is what they call me.
at least he called me princess.

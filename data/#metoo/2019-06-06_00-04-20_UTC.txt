June is 🄿🅃🅂🄳 awareness Month. ⁣
So Let’s talk about it. ⁣
⁣
PTSD from abuse is characterized by symptoms such as flashbacks, intrusive imagery, nightmares, anxiety, emotional numbing, insomnia, hyper-vigilance, and avoidance of traumatic triggers.⁣
⁣
Did you know that An estimated one out of every nine women develops PTSD, making them about twice as likely as men !!⁣
⁣
The OVW reports that a woman is assaulted or beaten every nine seconds in the U.S. Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women in this country. Every day, at least three U.S. women are killed by their partners. However DV can happen and does happen to men as well as woman but is much more common with woman. It also happens in heterosexual and homosexual relationships and doesn’t now race. ⁣
⁣
Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and PTSD have shaped my life greatly. If it’s shaped your life too, it doesn’t mean you have to live in a victim state of mind. There are therapies like EMDR that can help you work thru your trauma and learn more about PTSD, the abuse and why and how it’s has effected you. Most of all I want you to know You are not alone. And you are not what has happened to you !! Reach out for help and don’t be ashamed, only sane people get help !! ⁣

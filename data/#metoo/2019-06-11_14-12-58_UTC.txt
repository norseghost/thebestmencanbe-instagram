Let’s talk about this statement, “Girls can do anything.” Is it true?

Perhaps it’s true if you are a wealthy, attractive white woman who has all of the privileges in the world working for her.

But is it true for everyone else? Probably not.

So how do we make it true for everyone else? How do we make our society more inclusive for ALL women? How do we encourage women to work hard for their goals when the world is working against them?

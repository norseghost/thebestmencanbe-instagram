Inspired by the "me too" movement, this piece is about sexual abuse on children by people they trust. In our society, families still think it's a shame for a child to speak out after being sexually assaulted by one of their parents or an aunty or uncle. You see or hear of situations where the child is shipped off to the village or some strange place to keep the peace meanwhile the abuser is protected. How can we have a generation of children who can trust their parents or grow knowing that their parents are suppose to be their true protectors? For me, I use my art as a medium to create awareness on issues that most of us would rather not talk about like #childabuse

This piece is available for purchase and it would be my pleasure to have this at an organisation that deals with child abuse.

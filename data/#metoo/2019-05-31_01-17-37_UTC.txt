When I found out I had cancer, one of my big goals was to eliminate toxins from my surroundings. ⠀
⠀
One way I did that was by putting a SaveSleeve on my phone. Electronic devices emit radiation that’s harmful to your body. But this phone cover has special technology built into it that blocks over 99% of RF and 92% of ELF radiation. ⠀
⠀
This is especially important if you spend a lot of time with your phone next to your head, or sit with your laptop directly on your lap. #themoreyouknow

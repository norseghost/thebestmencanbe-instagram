Rebuilding...brick by brick piece by piece YOU rescued me!  God you are bigger than todays pain!  Bigger than tomorrows fears.  Bigger than yesterdayâ€™s mistakes.  Bigger than it all!  Nothing is too big for our God nothing is out of His reach.  Nothing and no one is too far from His love!  Nothing!  No one!  He is omni!  He is Abba!  He is the breath with in our lungs.  He is the presences in our soul.  He is the air we breath.  He is the rhythm of music.  The movement in the sea.

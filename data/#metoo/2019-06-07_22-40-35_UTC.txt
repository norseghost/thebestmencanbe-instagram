"The story of Medusa is deeply resonant. It is a visceral myth that reminds us that all too often a woman is separated from her own body, her own self, and sometimes her own life. Be it by specific laws that change her trajectory or the brutality of rape; and all the subtle betrayals in between, she is either punished for her choices, or is robbed of her very essence- the result is a woman who is silenced and regarded as either monster or trophy. Since the early months of the #metoo movement I have been a public participant. As a result, I have delved into the complexities and intersections of assault, bystander effect, bearing witness and accountability. The role of Athena met me at these crossroads. It was an honor to give her voice." #medusa #musical #divinefeminine #planetarium #greekmythology #smashthepatriarchy #animation #voiceacting #reclaiming #metoo For tix and info in bio or mos.org/adults

Had a great time sitting down with an old friend @shaunnewmanpodcast He came over for an in-studio interview! Thanks for taking the time to come over and hear a bit of my story ❤️. The episode will release in early July, stay tuned! I love his interviews, they range from local veterans, to young people, and if you are a hockey fan you are in luck because this is the podcast for you!!

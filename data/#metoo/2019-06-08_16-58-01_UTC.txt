Miss America Organisation head steps down .  Gretchen Carlson is stepping down as board chairman for the group that puts on the annual competition. Only last year Cara Mund, 24, the then Miss America 2018, wrote a letter calling for her resignation, citing bullying and intimidation by the chairwoman.
She had been a driving force for the elimination of the pageant’s once-signature swimsuit competition. Last year’s ABC-aired event was the first without one.
Carlson — the 1989 Miss America, who signed with ICM Partners in April — famously left Fox News Channel in 2016 after accusing its then-chairman Roger Ailes of sexual harassment and sued him. FNC later settled the case. IT founder Ailes died in 2017, less than a year after he resignedunder pressure amid multiple allegations.

Carlson went on to become an early leader on the #MeToo movement.
Former South Dakota Secretary of State Shantel Krebs will take over for Carlson as board chair, with attorney Brenda Keith serving as vice-chair.
NBC announced last week that it will broadcast the 2020 Miss America competition.

to start off this account, i wanted to bring up an insanely relevant part of politics today-abortion. this post is actually,,, upsetting honestly? although i myself am pro-choice-in allowing the person carrying the baby (for lack of a better word tbh) to do what they feel they need to do-i can understand a pro-life person’s pov somewhat. they believe it’s murder, and mostly it seems to be based on religion and how far to either political side one is raised. the solution for them is to just not get an abortion themselves, and for many i’ve seen such be the case. however, to not support abortion in the case of rape and incest at least is disgusting. (tw for the above) an 11 year old rape victim can not raise a child for they are a child themself. an 8 year old who got their period a bit early cannot physically bear the weight of carrying a child, especially not one belonging to their own father, brother. no, i don’t think abortion should be used as birth control, nor a way to rid of a disabled child, nor should it be available so late in pregnancy /unless the mother is going to die/. if you are pro-life in the sense that you would not get an abortion, but are pro letting people choose what they do with their bodies, and do not push your beliefs on others, i appreciate you greatly. it just sucks that women’s bodies are still being treated like public property in a way. but i guess that’s just tea ☕️-🌙

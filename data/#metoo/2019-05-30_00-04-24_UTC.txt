One of the most powerful tools in recovery, in fact, in life too, is perspective. I was amazed at how much peace and hope I felt when I learned to practice changing my perspective.  No doubt, healing from abuse and living with chronic PTSD can be very very challenging.  Using tools like changing your perspective will aid in the serenity we all desire on this challenging journey.  Today, I encourage us all to intentionally look at situations from a different more helpful perspective. #theemptiedheart #perspective #recovery #recoverytools #healingfromabuse #cptsdrecovery #cptsdsupport #silentnomore #metoo #metoonowwhat #metoomovement #weedorwish

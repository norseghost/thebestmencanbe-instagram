I remember hiding under a jacket 
Feeling the youngest side of 17
Not knowing what lurked the other side 
I could barely breathe 
Confiding in a txt to a friend I had preieveouly seen 
I never knew, a grown man could be so mean.
Or just too keen 
To forcefully penetrate a teen 
For the sake of his dirty pleasure 
Like he was wet and that's all that matters,
I didn't matter.
I was toy
Coz boys will be boys 
But it was far from fun 
Crushed by his manly weight 
I could not run 
Mentally and physically frozen 
My age falling all the way to my inner child, so young 
And in this moment,
I was alone.
I felt every inch of him
But in myself, I drained all the way numb 
I could taste the trembling of him knowing what he was doing was wrong
In the flavour of weed and rum 
I trembled no no no no
But he was driven by his dick and his ego
And I was driven internal 
Wondering, where did I go?

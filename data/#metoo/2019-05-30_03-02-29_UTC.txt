What is Lyme?
•
Lyme is a lot of things. Lyme is pain (keeping it real, LOTS of pain). Lyme is struggling and grasping at anything you can to pull yourself up for a breath of air. Lyme is pushing yourself beyond your limits to fight harder than you ever thought you could. Lyme is also self denial, and asking for help. Admitting we can’t handle this world alone anymore. •
Asking for help is one of the most difficult things. It means being vulnerable and taking lots of risks. It means risking being seen as weak or incapable. But it also means showing beauty and humanity. It makes others feel safe and tells them that they too can ask for help without fear. •
Needing help is scary. Feeling out of our realm of control is terrifying. Being vulnerable can send chills down a spine. But how can we impact the world and the souls living in it if we don’t take the leap of faith? •
Needing help isn’t a weakness. It’s a sign of strength and humility. Let’s practice more vulnerability and take off the masks we wear to hide the pain. Let’s talk and trust more. Let’s ask for help.

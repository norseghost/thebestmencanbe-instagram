I had written this piece last year when the #MeToo wave hit India (and how). Please take some time out from your day and read this! Share it with your family and friends! Even today majority of people in India (or the world for that matter) do not understand the concept of CONSENT! Especially Men! The amount of harassment stories I hear/see / read about daily makes me wanna throw up, scream and cry at the same time! 
I wrote it as a Twitter thread and later converted to a blog piece after the amount of traction it received! 
Find the link below for the piece

Read, share, comment! And let me know what you think or what are your opinions about consent and harassment!

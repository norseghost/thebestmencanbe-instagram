Just launched an Online Fundraiser for Safe Horizon. What makes Avon online fundraisers ðŸ’¯ times more satisfying than traditional flyer fundraisers is that 1) supporters are not limited to just the Purple Peace products but the entire brochure, all 200+ pages. 2) you can share but so much flyers within your reach verses online links you can share all over social media!!! 3) with traditional fundraisers the orders go to the representatives where they have to sort and deliver themselves verses Avon Now Delivers Directly to customers/supporters home Nationwide. 4) I can help more survivors online than around the block. Today I chose Safe Horizon not only because of my own experiences but for all the others that are still going through that nightmare. Next month Iâ€™ll do one for aspca and another for children born with the cleft lip.and one for veterans and the seniors etc. And the best part of it is managing the FR in my jammies and hand delivering the check in my Avon Fundraising outfit. Lol Iâ€™m soo loving this and real possibility of raising some real funds for our real survivors. To show your support click on the link below, shop, and share!

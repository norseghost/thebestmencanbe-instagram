I was lucky to do the grade on the animated short film Farce that is screening at @kortfilmfestivalen this week. The film was made by Robin Jensen and his team using old-school cut out techniques on a glass table with tons of raw meat, paint, blood and gore.

Itâ€™s a splatter movie inspired by todayâ€™s political climate and the #metoo movement. A solid kick to the balls!ðŸ¦¶

The constant news reports of women being violently assaulted and murdered in our society is overwhelmingly heartbreaking.

This needs to stop. 
There needs to be a change. 
Like many people affected by this, we have wondered if there was anything at all we could do to help. 
We can only use the tools at our disposal; and with this creative platform we aim to do whatever is in our power to bring attention to one aspect of this horror in our society. Abuse, be it sexual, physical, emotional or domestic, has a lasting effect on an individual, especially on their mental health. Our film explores this effect on our protagonist and alongside our creative process we explore the real life effects of assault and abuse through our interviews (soon to be released). It is one way for us as artists to impact the world that we are so affected by.

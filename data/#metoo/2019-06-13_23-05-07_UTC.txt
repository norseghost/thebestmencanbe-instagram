You don’t want to miss it! Join us TONIGHT for documentary screening and post film discussion. • 
Post-screening, national speaker & trauma specialist, Andrew Pari, LCSW, will host an audience discussion on the film’s message, your thoughts, and what’s being done in our community to address these issues. •
This event is being provided free to the community, in partnership with Sexual Assault Awareness LLC, Roll Red Roll Films, and funded in part by a grant from CalMHSA.

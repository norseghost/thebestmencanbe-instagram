PTSD makes people feel hopeless. Birth Trauma is more common than we would like to admit. Trauma-informed pregnancy support can reduce risks of low birth weight, preterm delivery, medical interventions, and complications during birth. Having a doula in the delivery room with you reduces risk of obstertric abuse or trauma during delivery. ‚ù§Ô∏è People who have PTSD--whether it was caused by giving birth, active duty, sexual assault, natural disasters, a death / loss / or miscarriage, interpersonal violence, persistent poverty, childhood abuse or neglect, a car accident...are ALL less likely to access prenatal care, and often find pregnancy exasperates their symptoms. 
No two ways about it--being triggered by your pregnancy sucks. üí©

But you CAN have a happy pregnancy and a tranquil birth, even if you're struggling to feel safe or heal old wounds. ‚ù§Ô∏è

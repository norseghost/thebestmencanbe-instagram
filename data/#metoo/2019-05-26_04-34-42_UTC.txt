Had to re-share. Our society and culture today has placed an emphasis on women and children in trauma, which to me makes zero sense when little boys grow up to be men. Whether they become victim or perpetrator our conversation needs to include them to create a society that encourages our boys to share their feelings, manage their feelings and reach out for help without judgement.  #Repost @manahealing777 with @get_repost

Screw you & your statistics! MEN GET ABUSED TOO. DON'T LIE! While I share about my experiences and there are many women who have been abused, I've actually met more men than women who have been abused and don't say anything because of where society places them. .

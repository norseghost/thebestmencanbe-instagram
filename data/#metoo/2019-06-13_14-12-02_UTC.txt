When you have experienced sexual assault, getting help is so important. Besides God the most important step in my healing was therapy. Itâ€™s  important to pick a therapist who is trained in your type of trauma and is a good fit for you. Itâ€™s never too late to start your healing journey. Iâ€™m rooting for you ðŸ’•Images by Lindsay Braman #victornotvictim #metoo #churchtoo #victornotvictim #ptsd #cptsd

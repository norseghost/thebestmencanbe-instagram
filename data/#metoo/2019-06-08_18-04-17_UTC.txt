An ongoing exploration of a woman’s life is the work for me at the moment. I usually like to let the viewer use their own imagination but I’m seeing her as naively going into battle not knowing yet that it will be for a lifetime. I’ve already started the next one where she has her eyes opened to the enormity of the task ahead......
I hope women feel a kinship with this piece...

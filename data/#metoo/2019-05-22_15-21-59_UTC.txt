This is me 100%
I definitely have my hyper moments! Them moments where you just don't care but overall I'm pretty reserved! Although alot of the time I have alot to say I tend to think more than I speak and listen more than anything!

I always say my son was made for me!
He works better with routine I LOVE routine!
He can get overwhelmed with to much socialising ME TOO!
I even find eye contact hard at times I have noticed lately but I am listening so please remember that if you feel your child isn't listening because they are not looking directly into their eyes!  Because it could just feel a little AWKARD and I get it ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜‚ We are so similar and different at the same time so I guess we help each other ðŸ˜…

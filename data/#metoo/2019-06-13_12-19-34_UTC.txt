I think we often forget that we are able to make the choice in our life. The choice to be free from the heartache, free from what feels like the chains of mental health. To be happy. .
.
I once thought that there was never a way out. But I now know that I make that choice every day. .
.
But I don't just choose to be free and happy. I choose me. .

Thanks to all who came out to support, listen, and ask questions.  I appreciate the hugs and affirming words and those who shared that they have been inspired to look at their own ‘elephants’. Enjoy a few photos from the evening and PLEASE take the time to follow #WhatsYourElephant on Facebook, Instagram. (https://www.facebook.com/whatsyourelephant and https://www.instagram.com/whatsyourelephant) If you got something from last night - please help to share the work so others access it.  Stay tuned for upcoming ‘What’s Your Elephant’ talks, workshops, exhibitions and collaborations. 
With YOUR support this movement will grow and help to impact the world! 🐘🎨

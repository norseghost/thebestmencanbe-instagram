In the wake of #metoo, there's been an influx in conversations about masculnity, and specifically toxic masculinity. Join Womankind for a panel discussion on Asian American masculinities. Our panelists will chat about the complexities of identity, belonging and representation as Asian American men. We hope this will be a community space where we can all reflect on the nuances of racialized gender identities that are often ignored.

Our panelists include: Jason Koo of @brooklynpoets, actor @EricElizaga, and @davidnguyen of @thebadasiansshow.

We especially encourage those who identify as Asian American men to attend, though this event is free and open to people of all genders and identities.

The panel begins at 6:30pm, but we recommend people arrive at 6pm to have time to grab drinks and food. See you there!

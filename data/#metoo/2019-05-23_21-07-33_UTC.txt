Obviously shit has gone bananas in a few states, with the imminent threat of federal changes controlling womxn and their bodies. Perhaps a retaliation for #metoo? I’ve been having trouble putting words to my thoughts; couple that with feeling constantly triggered and you get analysis paralysis, which has been my recent state. So please forgive the silence. .
I’m adopted. My story has a happy ending but that is not the norm. And I can’t help but feel like my story has been used as ammunition for evil, which is a supremely dark feeling. I am not *more* grateful for my life because I could’ve been aborted. Bom (bio-mom) does not deserve exaltation for the decision she made. All of the options in that moment were garbage. She did what was best for her and would never curse a person in the same position for taking a different road. I can’t say whether my story has shaped what I would choose, and in no way would that ever allow me to decide for anyone else what to do. No one owes anyone their story to prove a point. Stop conflating abortion and adoption. If you think this is about saving lives you are woefully naive.

💕 My main purpose for setting up Ssassi and writing my book - Standing strong in Vulnerability - was to show women, by sharing my truth, that they are not alone.
•
By stepping out of the shadows and into the light, sharing the deepest, hardest and truest story that I have within me, was to shine a light for others to step into, and know they are not alone.
•
Taking that risk - to be seen - really seen - and showing our truest, most honest self is vulnerable.
•
But, by saying ‘me too’ encourages, supports and lights a way for our great women survivors to risk vulnerability too and find themselves surrounded by love.
•
It is always clearer to see who we really are, in the light, and under the loving gaze of other great women. Survivors who can remind us that, (in the words of Oprah Winfrey,) ‘You are not your circumstances - you are your possibilities!’ 🙌🏼 With Love & Gratitude Always 🙏🏻💜 #ssassi #superheroines #book #standing #strong #vulnerability #standingstronginvulnerability #stepoutinthelight #stepoutfromtheshadows #ownyourtruth #metoo #women #survivors #possibilities #oprahwinfrey

So a couple nights ago we went to a restaurant. We knew that manager and she’s trained service dog. There was only three of us and they gave us this 6-8 person table. Lol. It was awesome but like what?!!! Anyway. Tobias did amazing. He’s been wanting to work and has been ding amazing with training and tasking. I love him so much and I thankful to have him.

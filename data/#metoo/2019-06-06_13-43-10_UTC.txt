I watched the first episode of this, it’s actually pretty bad. They somehow try to make you feel sympathy towards people who assaulted joggers and other people in the park, later they try and prove that those same people raped a women. Which really isn’t that far fetched I mean think about it. A group of teens are harassing and attacking people in the park and later that same night a women is raped and beaten in the same park? Yea they definitely look super innocent.

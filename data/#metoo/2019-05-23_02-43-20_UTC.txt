You got it, girlfriend. Your body, your choice.

Teach them young. What is happening in our country right now is NOT okay. I want my daughter to grow up in a world knowing she is in charge of her own body and has the power to do what she wants with it. 1 in 4 women has had an abortion in their life. All women should have their own right to choose whether or not abortion is right for them. There are far more unfortunate circumstances in life than you’d care to imagine where an abortion is medically necessary. We don’t take this power lightly. So have some dignity, show some grace, and stop punishing us just because we have vaginas.

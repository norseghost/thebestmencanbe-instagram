Their villages were torched, burning many alive. Children were repeatedly raped. Soldiers tore babies from their mothers and threw them into the fires. They shot and killed Rohingya men in front of their families. This campaign of terror ultimately drove more than 700,000 Rohingya from their home villages and into neighboring Bangladesh, where they now languish in refugee camps with little food or water. Some 120,000 Rohingya who remain in Myanmar are largely confined to camps, where they are refused jobs or even permission to marry. U.N. investigators and the press are not allowed into Rakhine state, Myanmar where the genocide is mainly taking place. This a an obstruction of justice and it is our global responsibility to not allow genocides to happen without any intervention. Spread the word and stop the silence and end the violence

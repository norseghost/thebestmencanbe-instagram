No reading today, I'm dealing with something that may help others if I talk.about.

I've been raped recently, and in the same fashion, 4 years ago, assaulted. 4 years ago when I reported it, the police treated me as If I were either lying or that I asked for it. Eventually I was told, by a female officer, how was he to know I didnt want him to touch me. 
So, days ago I had a fight with a karmic I tried to give a second chance after my DM lied to me. I was distraught and put myself in a xanax coma. I was out for 30 hours and in those 30 hours I was raped in my sleep. 
I know, if you've ever been through such things you want to blame yourself but it is not your fault. Whether you're conscious saying no or unconscious unable to say no, it is not your fault. I called my DM crying for help, need someone to hold my hand while I got prodded for evidence. But he ignored me. The 3 people I called for help all ignored me. So I am feeling so many emotions of betrayal and pain, I dont know how to handle. 
I just want those out there that have experienced this, it's not your fault and you're not alone. I love you, I will be here for you, I will not ignore you when you need a friend the most. You are strong and you will overcome it. With all the love in my heart, I understand you. ðŸ’ž

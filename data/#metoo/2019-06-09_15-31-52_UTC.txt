üß° THANK YOU üß° Everyone who came to my 2 classes during half term. All profits went to my friend‚Äôs Cancer Charity.  together we raised ¬£105 which is incredible! With all my heart, thank you. This is by far the most uncomfortable thing I‚Äôve ever shared and that is exactly why I am going to... when I first met Bonbon I was not the person I am now. Bon gave me the sweetest Surrender of understanding I had ever felt and that will always be precious to me. She listened to my experiences of sexual abuse and addiction with nothing but love and compassion. She always said, ‚Äúwhatever the question love is the answer‚Äù. She was such a warrior of light and she was right. The more I tried to run away and deny my past the more power it had over me. This is one of the last pics of Bon and I together. Her precious light went out too early and recently she she left this mortal coil two days after her 34th Birthday. So young. Such a terrifying reminder to hug, squeeze, pick up the phone and appreciate those we love and who have changed us for the better. Life is so short and we have no idea what it has in store for us. Things can change so fast. I never got a chance to say goodbye but will always be united with her in Love. #thesweetestgirl #lettinggo #liveyourtruth

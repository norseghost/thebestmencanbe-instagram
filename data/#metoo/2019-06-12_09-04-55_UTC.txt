There are three main types of female genital mutilation. In the picture the green parts highlight what is cut from girls. Babies as young as four months are being mutilated in Australia. Check out my Ted talk in bio to learn more. 🙏🏾
⚡️type 1 (clitoridectomy) – removing part or all of the clitoris
⚡️type 2 (excision) – removing part or all of the clitoris and the inner labia (the lips that surround the vagina), with or without removal of the labia majora (the larger outer lips)
⚡️type 3 (infibulation) – narrowing the vaginal opening by creating a seal, formed by cutting and repositioning the labia
⚡️other harmful procedures to the female genitals, including pricking, piercing, cutting, scraping or burning the area.

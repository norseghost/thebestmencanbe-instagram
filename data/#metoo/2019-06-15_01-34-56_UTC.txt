some days i feel invincible and some days i’m hyperventilating on the bathroom floor. something difficult i’m having to learning is that after experiencing trauma there is no timetable on how long it takes to heal. i know i’m suppose to focus on the positives, i survived, i learned a lot, etc but sometimes i don’t want to be positive, sometimes i just need to be allowed to be angry, because i am angry. i hate my abuser. i hate what he did to me. i hate that because of him i’m permanently changed. i hate that even though it’s been almost two years i still have nightmares, triggers, flashbacks, a boatload of trust/abandonment issues, and days like today— where i’m hyperventilating on the bathroom floor.

                        "text": "\u201cHarvey Weinstein and his former studio\u2019s board members have reached a tentative $44 million deal to resolve lawsuits filed by women who accused him of sexual misconduct and by the New York State attorney general, according to three people briefed on the matter.\n\nThe outcome of the settlement talks will be especially notable because the lawsuits are one of the main avenues by which Mr. Weinstein could be held responsible for his alleged actions.\n\nHe is facing criminal charges in New York for allegations of sexual violence against two women. But more than 80 women have accused him of wrongdoing, and many of those complaints involve sexual harassment, which is a civil violation, not a criminal one. So the details of any settlement \u2014 such as whether it includes an admission of wrongdoing by Mr. Weinstein \u2014 would carry significant symbolism.\n\nThe proposed sum is less than half of what was initially discussed as a victims\u2019 fund as part of conversations last year between an investor group that was interested in buying assets of the Weinstein Company and Eric T. Schneiderman, who was then New York\u2019s attorney general. That proposed deal, which fell apart at the last minute, included a victims\u2019 fund worth up to $90 million\u201d @nytimes #MeToo #MeTooEthiopia #metoomovement"

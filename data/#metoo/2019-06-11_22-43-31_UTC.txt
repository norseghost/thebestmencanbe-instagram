In a national survey by the American Association of University Women, it was found that 73% of LGBTQ identifying students reported sexual assault or harassment, compared their straight and cisgender peers. Not only did this harassment come from other students, it was also came from faculty and campus staff. And sadly, many LGBTQ students do not report because they are scared of hostile treatment or ridicule. â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €
Itâ€™s important to remember these stats and support LGBTQ survivors not only during June, but all yearðŸ’›

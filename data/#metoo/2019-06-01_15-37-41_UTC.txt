In motherhood self care should be high on our priority list. I have to take the time to replenish my body + mind💗✌🏼It allows me to overflow with energy, positivity, + peace to serve others. No one can pour and serve from an empty cup. —
Of course, it’s important to have those moments of relaxation☕️sink into a hot cup of coffee + collect our thoughts but it’s also important to physically move our bodies too. I can’t look at my schedule of mothering three children four years + under to hopefully fall into some “free time” if this so called “free time” never happened then my health goals didn’t happen. I had to MAKE time for the physical self care🏋🏼‍♀️💦

Let’s be honest, no one is “that” busy, our mindset says we are. We control what we pencil in during our day. If I could make time for Netflix, or waiting in the drive thru for coffee, or even anytime my butt hit the couch in between mothering + taking care of the house - then I had time to throw on some shoes and sweat.

I put on my workout clothes in the morning so I’m already half way there. I push play the moment I have all three content and I go for it👊🏼The majority of the time my boys are in the room playing and running around. Sure, at first it was a little difficult but the more consistent I became the better things fell into place and new habits  formed🌱the hardest part is starting but if you plant the seed, a version of you is waiting to be discover —
Mamas, self care is how we take our power back💪🏼 We must remember that self care isn’t “Me first” it means “Me too”💞Don’t give life the rest of you, give life the best of you .

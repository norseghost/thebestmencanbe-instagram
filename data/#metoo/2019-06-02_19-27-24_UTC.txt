Took one of my favorite faith role models John Paul the 2nd speech that has literally been on repeat iny brain since I head him say his specific phrase for those who suffer from anxiety, panic attacks, despair, suicidal thoughts, Depression, Uncertainty, FEAR. all these things I have experienced to the tenth degree in my life. Seriously.. I've been in each one for an average of 3 years STRAIGHT. Those who battle me tal illness knows. It's not for the faint of heart.. #motivational #newmusic #comingsoon #today #deepthoughts #mentalhealth #recovery #survivor #of #ptsd #ocd #depression #anxiety #bipolar #schizophrenia #tourettesyndrome #metoo #religion #alcoholism

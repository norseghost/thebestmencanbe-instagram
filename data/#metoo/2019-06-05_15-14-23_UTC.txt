I highly recommend the podcast @somethingwaswrongpodcast (thank you @shontep )! After being emotionally and physically abused by narcissist, this was very cathartic. Knowing there are others is gives me a sense a solidarity but is also enraging. For people who have never been in this type of relationship, it leaves you questioning your sense of reality, your sanity, and sense of self. This podcast lays out the complete insanity of these types of relationships and how it can completely break a person. I encourage you to listen for understanding and maybe to empathize with someone you may know.

Most of these relationships leave you with more questions than answers. I suffered and still suffer from anxiety and PTSD. When I was listening, I found my myself going “yup” a lot. They all follow patterns. Which I find the most disturbing. She was similar to me and was close to her family, they got her out and had the resources to. I was lucky enough that my family and friends supported me while I went to @laurashouseoc and got help. They are an amazing group of people. **
If you find yourself in this type of relationship or know someone that is... there is always a way out. PLEASE KNOW THAT. I am your ally. I am always here to talk 💜💜💜

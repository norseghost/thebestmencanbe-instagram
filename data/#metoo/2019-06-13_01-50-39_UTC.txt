🍑IMPORTANT🍑 TAG all the wondrous women you know! 🍓

I’m sick of men dictating what happens with our bodies so I’m creating a tasteful collection of fruits and other objects that I feel represent us in the most organic manner.  A. Every inch of us is beautiful and should not have to be censored or feel ashamed for and B. We have rights too. .

I have selected July 4th as the release date (stay tuned for specific times) as this is the day I ended a 3 year abusive relationship and I feel should be a day of celebration of Independence in all ways and not just one. There will only be between 15-20 paintings and will range from 8x8inch ($250) to 10x10inch ($450) with 20% being donated to @plannedparenthood (please do not make any negative remarks about them. They offer a wide variety of services of health care for women and I greatly respect them).

If you would like to get on the pre release list for this collection to liken the chances of collecting your favorite please send me an email at heatherfreitasart@gmail.com to be added to my email list with the subject headline subscribe to email list (or send me a DM with your email ♥️)✌🏼

Thank you all for your continued support over the years and together we can make a difference ♥️. .

Signs Of Abuse

It can be hard to know if you’re being abused. You may think that your partner is allowed to make you have sex. That’s not true. Forced sex is rape, no matter who does it. You may think that cruel or threatening words are not abuse. They are. And sometimes is a sign that a person will become physically violent.  Below is a list of possible signs of abuse.

Some of these are illegal, all of them are wrong.

You may be abused if your partner:

Monitors what you’re doing all the time
Unfairly accuses you of being unfaithful all the time
Prevents or discourages you from seeing friends or family
Prevents or discourages you from going to work or school
Gets very angry during and after drinking alcohol or using drugs

Decides things for you that you should be allowed to decide (like what to wear or eat)

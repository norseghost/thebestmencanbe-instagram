I've come a long way. Went from pushing knives into my neck, to an opiate problem to cutting myself to an alcoholic and started trying harder things. I caught myself before I could truly hurt let alone kill myself. I've been fighting this mental battle since the age of 10. Going on 13 years. Some people give up and don't make it this long but I'm living proof that you can sober up. You can get your life together. You can live a better way of life. You can be happy. But all of this begins with you changing your ways.

Don't let your story start to fail now. You're story isn't over yet. Start making changes for the better. Cause right now your choices are aiming you for the worst to come.

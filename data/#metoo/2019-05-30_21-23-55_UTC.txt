I am truly humbled by the outpouring of support and awareness City of Salt is bringing to our community. This film touches on so many issues (gun violence, rape culture, suicide, LGBTQ issues, opioid abuse, and more), but does it through narrative and without an agenda. Here is our interview with Film 360, as well as our trailer. Let's put Utah on the map for positive social change through the arts!

It's cold and miserable here in Melbourne. So I'm laying in bed watching @hannah_gadsby #nanette.

Have you seen Nanette? The first time i saw it i cried. It is so powerful, especially as a woman, as a gay woman, Hannah's story hits me right in the heart.

My dear Hannah,

You are not incorrectly female. You are perfect. I cannot imagine the heartache and trauma that you have experienced throughout your life but I have experienced my own.

I too am not a man hater, but i am afraid of them. I am not butch, but being femme comes with its own danger. How could I be feminine and not be interested in a man?

Men don't like it when you say no.

I've been abused by men because I've said no. On the tram, on the street, in clubs, even at work. You're too pretty to be gay, you don't know what you're missing out on, you're such a waste of a pussy.

Men have thrown me against walls, pushed their bodies up against mine and asked me how much because standing on the street dresses up must mean im sex worker because that's all im worth to them.

I've been followed off trams, jeered at from cars that circle back for a second look, I've been grabbed, pushed, pulled, even by men in LGBTIQ+ spaces, where I'm meant to be safe. And then my straight friends wonder why I'm uncomfortable in cishet spaces.

No I'm not a man hater but i have reason to be afraid. I'm afraid to say no because of the reaction that might elicite. Im afraid so I smile and put my head down so i seem weak and demure. I laugh at the jokes walk casually away out of fear that if I say no then he'll follow me home or start abusing me as has happened so many times before.

I'm afraid to say I'm gay because for so many men all I need to cure my homosexuality is a good cock. I am a challenge and men don't like to lose.

Men don't like to lose.

My dear Hannah, we not the ones that need to change.

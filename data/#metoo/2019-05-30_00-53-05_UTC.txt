I’m so used to bottling everything inside because of my abuse. I held all emotions of that in for 13 years. I can take being let down from people & the emotional pain some cause for a good bit, but then eventually it all starts to be too much. I’ve let people treat me like shit then just pretend everything was fine. I shouldn’t have to do that. You get the respect you give, & if I can’t get that in return then I’m not trying. #survivor #MeToo #SupportSurvivors

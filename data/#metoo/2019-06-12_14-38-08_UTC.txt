Peace and Love, 
It’s weighing on me heavy the last few days how a few ppl around me has been testing my limits. 
From co-workers, to friends, to neighbors... I’ve always been one to be honest about my mistakes 
To hold my relationships in the highest light and 
Never, not give ppl the benefit of the doubt. 
That’s my heart. 
But I’m finally accepting the fact that ppl will take advantage of your vulnerability, your lack of self love, and even your desperation in your weakest moments 
But when you LOVE yourSELF first... none of these things can ever take place. 
That’s why loving me, catering to my own wants, needs, and desires is now first priority. 
Because if I don’t have me, 
No one will. 
Remember in your healing that you don’t have to be comfortable to be “okay” with everything that is said/done to you. 
You don’t have to punish yourself for your mistakes as long as you are true to them and yourself. 
Love you enough to own your darkness and your light. 
The rest will reveal itself to you. 
With Love, 
DeyelahDea

A piece from photobook 'Celestial Bodies' by young artists @eleanorhardwick @rachelhardwickphotography and @chrissiewhite offers a new perspective on the often hyper-sexualised female body: ➖
“In society and the media, the female body seems to be either hyper-sexualised or shamed, and rarely appreciated for the incredible feat of nature that it really is. I think that presenting the female form as somewhat other-worldly and alien, all preconceptions that many of us have linked to the idea of the nude body are stripped away. By looking at it with fresh eyes, within the context of landscapes that almost look as if they could be on another planet, we are able to take a step back and view the world from a new perspective." @rachelhardwickphotography @thelovepost.global

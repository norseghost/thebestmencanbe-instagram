At least my book is still selling well, good to see it at Waterstones.  I suffered an early foolish, reckless teenage marriage in far away Australia . It was supposed to be an adventure. We all make mistakes, but I never expected the anguish and terror of the total loss of freedom and painful homesickness.  I wanted to be home with my mother in London. Instead I was controlled by a cruel husband ,abused , isolated and traumatised and still have nightmares although the man is now dead from drink and I am back home. I hope the book might give hope and inspiration to those stuck in despair and miserable situations . I felt I had to write about it and get it all off my chest #nevergiveup #neverlosehope #neversurrender #rebel #escape #survive #win #standuptobullying #success #metoo

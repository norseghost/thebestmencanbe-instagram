It's ok NOT to be ok! Please reach out as you are never alone. You will be amazed how talking to someone can truly make a difference, allowing those negative feelings to escape your heart through words is like allowing a negative energy to leave us that consumes your heart and soul..
The more we hold these negative feelings inside the more they consume us with the constant hammering of words scrambled into a mess of emotions running through our brains and while we are like this it can be hard to unscramble them into perspective so we can move forward. Just remember you are human, life didn't come with a manual nor did it come with emotional switches we can just turn on or off...but we still have control of these thoughts and emotions it just takes a little hard work and by slowly regaining ownership of thoughts we can eventually start taking our lives back. Please reach out, your life matters! XO

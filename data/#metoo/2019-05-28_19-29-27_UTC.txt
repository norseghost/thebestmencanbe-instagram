The Cannes Film Festival's dress code is famously strict, adhering to the styles commonly found during its early years in the 1940s: men are required to wear tuxedos and a bowtie, while women are expected to attend in full length gowns. Post-Time's Up and #MeToo, the fashion rules are changing - and fast - and it's time the old guard caught up. Writing for @independent.ie @independentstyle 📲(which I forgot to share on Saturday) 🤷‍♀️

Chinese medicine recognizes an imbalance called excessive joy. It is a state of prolonged excitement that does damage to the heart. 
Our culture promotes and idolizes this kind of imbalance. We think there is a way to be happy all the time. That there is some formula that we can enact that erases all uncomfortable emotions and create unending bliss. 
This is not only untrue, it is dangerous. Dangerous partly because of the shame and disappoinment that comes when we fail to be happy all the time. Partly because it can cause us to bypass the intelligent lessons our emotions give us about the work we need to do to keep growing. Partly because of the real physical damage that can happen when we refuse to embrace all of our emotional expression.

Balance comes when we can accept all of what we bring. The bliss and joy as well as the messy, tricky, sticky emotions like anger, grief, guilt and fear. Acceptance of all of us brings peace. Sometimes it is peace in our unhappiness, sometimes peace in our joy.

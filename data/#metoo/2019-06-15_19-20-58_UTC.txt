False Rape accusations of this magnitude are definitely a problem. And it's only going to get worse with time. The one that says it isn't, has not looked at it from any other viewpoint. It's a sickening way to think that it's not, because they don't want to believe anything that doesn't fill their bubble.

As a man, that makes it difficult for someone like me to make moves without fear. Because in this day and age, you just don't know. As smart men, it pays to protect yourself, in all directions.

There's a LOT more to this story, including a judge telling Jessica that giving her the kids would “ruin his criminal case” against Adam. He then had her arrested for yelling at him. According to people like J.c. Holt, this is not a problem.

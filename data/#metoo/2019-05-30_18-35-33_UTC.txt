Our office building in downtown Toronto is attached to a network of underground shopping known as The Path stretching from Dundas and Yonge on the Northeast side, Dundas and Bay on the Northwest side, and then South to Union station spreading fatly as it goes - so that you can take The Path as far West as University in some parts, although it maintains its Eastern border. 
Although I know most of The Path well enough that I could get anywhere, like a cat that walks the same territory every day, I stick to my favourite stores and therefore, usual sections of the Path.

Today though, I had to go to Cartier at lunch, so travelled part of the path that I haven’t been through for more than a year. I found that a favourite store to purchase hand bag is now a store that sells hand crafted soaps and lotions; was delighted to find that a store that has sold funky Japanese-style women’s clothing that’s been there as long as I can remember, remains so, and also discovered that there is now a barbershop that has nothing but young women staffing it.

They’re pretty, blonde or brunette, slim; and though they aren’t overtly sexualized (wearing men-style shirts, flats,  jeans, and aprons that cover most of the front of their bodies); I was still squicked out.

I suppose if I was a cis-het man, I might enjoy having a PYT tend to my beard, or trim my hair (although I’d like to think that I’d be a feminist cis-het man and so eschew a service that so clearly wants to tread along a very thin, sharp edge without tumbling into #metoo territory, but still capitalize on the wrong side of that edge.

BSP says that human rights as she calls it, (cultural norms as I might), are cyclical. That we reached a zenith in the early oughts and that we are now on a downswing again.

With the worldwide rise of Fascism and hard-won rights being stripped in the West (accompanied by a sickening upswing in tolerance of intolerable behaviour); I wondered today if this seeming folderol of a barbershop is really an indication that we’ve long reached the tipping point and are simply gathering speed.

Pic is of my shopping, because I didn’t want to take a pic of the women barbers, who are already on display

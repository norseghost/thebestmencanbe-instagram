What an incredible journey it’s been writing this book! Lots of epiphanies, challenges, laughter, tears, pride, fear...basically every feeling and emotion you can imagine! I’m so excited to share a sneak peek of the new cover and I can’t wait to share the book with you all next month! Stay tuned for details on the YGG book tour! xo 📖✍️🥂💥
A big thanks to Kelly for all your help! 💗

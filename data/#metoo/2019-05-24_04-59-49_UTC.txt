Excerpt from my poem #Firefly. ⁣
⁣
Offer to help a predator climb out of a hole⁣ and he’ll do so on a ladder constructed from your bones.⁣⁣
⁣
We are not meant to nor are we equipped to nor are we obliged to heal all the wounded souls that come our way, especially if doing so means wounding ourselves.⁣
⁣
And aside from feeling like we need to save someone or be their caretaker, I know there are many things that can make it difficult to leave. Somehow the uncertainty of the unknown can seem to be a far more terrifying option than the constant abuse or toxicity we’ve become accustomed to. This can make us keep choosing the comfort we find in the familiar―even if that comfort is killing us.⁣
⁣
But once you begin to make the difficult decisions necessary to reclaim your life, you will move closer to what is aligned with who you truly are and what you truly deserve. It’s like sending out a message energetically that says, “No, I no longer choose this. I deserve better.” The universe will respond accordingly. The process may be super challenging, but on the day you find yourself far removed from toxicity, manipulation and abuse, and surrounded by more joy, love, comfort, safety and peace than you could have ever dreamed possible, you will have no question as to whether or not the work has been worth it.⁣
⁣
There is beauty beyond your imagination awaiting you on the path of freedom.⁣

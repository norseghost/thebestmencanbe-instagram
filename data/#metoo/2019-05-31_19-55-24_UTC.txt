The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reported that sexual harassment complaints rose 13.6 percent last year.

The accusations of the #MeToo movement include several big success stories. Harvey Weinstein, once so powerful in the entertainment industry, no longer has immunity to prey on people. Leslie Moonves, the former chair and CEO of CBS, was ousted from the company after allegations of sexual misconduct and retaliation. 
It’s not just happening in Hollywood or the media. Numbers released by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency responsible for enforcing civil rights laws against gender, race, religious, and other forms of workplace discrimination, show that even as the overall number of complaints received is down 9.3 percent from 2017, complaints about sexual harassment rose 13.6 percent over the previous year. “We’ve seen more people, mostly women but not exclusively women, willing to speak up,” said Victoria Lipnic, the agency’s acting chair. The numbers show that despite the obstacles to reporting harassment, more people are doing it. 
It’s a useful, if imperfect, marker for measuring the magnitude of #MeToo. If that many more people made it to an EEOC filing, it’s reasonable to imagine that complaints registered elsewhere, whether at a state or local agency or internally with an employer, rose as well. “Since we started in January 2018, we’ve had over 4,000 people reach out to us for help,” said Sharyn Tejani, director of the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which offers assistance to individuals facing workplace sexual harassment. 
Tejani said two-thirds of those who have reached out identify themselves as low-wage workers.

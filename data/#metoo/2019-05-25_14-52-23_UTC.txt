When I tell people about Lolita Lebrón, they often seem surprised or skeptical. After all, how could a Latina have led an armed attack against the United States House of Representatives, a 1954 attack in which this petite and beautiful woman entered Congress in her elegant suit with guns blazing and injured five elected officials, and not be widely known in American history? 
The answer to this is easy: Lebrón is erased and ignored, because she and what she stood for are as inconvenient as they are dangerous to the status quo.

Born in 1919 in San Juan, Lolita was one of five kids. Her dad was a laborer who struggled to feed his family on $30 a month wages. They did not have medical care. Lolita fell into a filthy open sewer as a young girl and contracted debilitating pneumonia as a result. It made her sickly and frail for the rest of her life, and the injustice of her circumstances was the start of her radical politicization.

Lolita finished her formal studies in the 8th grade but was a well read woman and a poet who felt things hard. When a group of independentistas (Puerto Ricans in favor of nationhood rather than territory status) were attacked and killed in 1937, she vowed to devote her life to their cause.

In 1954 Lebrón organized and led a group of men in the attack upon the US House. She was arrested and jailed for 25 years before being granted clemency by President Jimmy Carter. She died in 2010 at the age of 90.

A few weeks ago the First Amherstburg Freedom Summit was held. Being on the committee; being awarded the pleasure of working with and conversing with such amazing, dynamic individuals =Inspiration.  So much to say, so much to reflect on personally and professionally. We're in this knowing life is greater than ourselves. #Educators #BlackYouth #SocialChange #Direction #WhyDidntISmileTho lol

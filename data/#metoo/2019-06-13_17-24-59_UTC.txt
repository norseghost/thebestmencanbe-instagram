#TBT to two years ago when we went to the High Court and our long ass court case finally came to an end. 
It took two years from allegations to arrest, and was four years before we went to court the first time. We won the case, and then went through one appeal and then one to the high court. 
Thankfully judges ruled 4-3 that he not be allowed to make us go through all of that again. (But seriously, what were the 3 thinking?) All of us girls that went to court to face him, and the many more who didnâ€™t, are bonded together forever by this. 
I am forever grateful to the @nswpolice and especially the detectives of Strike Force Ruskin who were with us for all those years. They put up with me even when I was a complete brat. 
Also thank you to @acurrentaffair9 and @womansdayaus who got the story out there and helped us change history.

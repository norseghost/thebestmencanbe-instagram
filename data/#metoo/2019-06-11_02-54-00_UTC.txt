Today is my daughters birthday. I went through so many pictures but this is the one I felt was best for this day! 
I can remember holding her just like this many years ago... I loved her massive when I knew I was pregnant with her and I love her massive now as she holds her child. 
There are so many things I could say about her. For those of you who know her, you know she is an incredible woman, beautiful, talented, gifted. An amazing singer, piano player, cook and baker(which I would like to have more ofðŸ˜‰), mom, friend, wife, and best daughter I could ever ask for. 
I was blessed to be her coach when she gave birth and it was the most amazing thing to experience. I knew she was such a strong person but my goodness...watching her go through that pain and endure natural child birth like a rockstar, I was blown away! I always pray my ceiling is my kids foundation! Her walk with Jesus is solid and Iâ€™m so very very proud of her. 
I canâ€™t wait to see what this next season of transition brings her. I know it will be incredible. I love you @the.mrs.paul 
Happiest of birthdays to you. Love you to the moon and back.

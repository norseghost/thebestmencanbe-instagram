Good Morning My Fierce Fabulous Family  its Wisdom Wednesday here's Today's quote The bane of our lives is to live up to the expectations of the whole world, starting from our parents, to our teachers, our peers and family. Itâ€™s like the weight of the entire world is on our shoulders as everyone seems to have such lofty expectations from us. Once we fall into this trap of pleasing others, we are trapped for life. After trying all our life, we still manage to disappoint many of them. Thus, what is the need of pleasing everyone in the first place? Your duty is to yourself first. Be loyal to your dreams and aspirations and when you reap success, youâ€™ll realize everyone is clapping for you.

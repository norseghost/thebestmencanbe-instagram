It’s always been so important to us at Brazen Babe to find ways to give back.  I’m blessed and I know it.  I wanted to find a way to combine a business I love with a way to make a difference and I’ve been able to do that with Brazen Babe.  For every purchase, $1 will be donated to @nwcave NWCAVE.org (National Women’s Coalition Against Violence and Exploitation). I encourage you all to take a look at their site.  They do incredible work!

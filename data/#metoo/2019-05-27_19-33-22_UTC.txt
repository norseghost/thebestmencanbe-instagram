ACM does not support “professionalism.” This expectation in the capitalist “workplace” is a manifestation of white supremacist patriarchy under the guise of “objectivity.” This culture, which claims to value “reason” and “fairness”, silences and harms marginalized identities, especially BIPOC, self identified women and femmes, disabled folks, and all the ways these intersect. Instead of being “professional,” ACM prides ourselves in our commitment to liberate all beings, not cause harm, be accountable and repair when we do cause harm, support leadership of the most impacted, be trauma-informed, interdependent, and recognize our collective humanity.

They wanted her to change back into what she always had been. \nBut she had wings. - Dean Jackson \u2763\ufe0f Beautiful friends, grow your wings. Be different, be brave, be uniquely you. \nLet them talk. There will always be someone who doesn\u2019t like what you are doing or who you are, guaranteed. \nBut they do not know your story. And if they know it they don\u2019t fully understand because they are not you. \nI know it is so hard to ignore what everyone is saying behind your back (or to your face.) But you also have those who are going to fly with you and cheer you on. \nKeep growing and keep on striving to be the healthiest, strongest version of you. Sometimes that means making really hard choices that others won\u2019t like. But again, they are not you. \nPray, trust that God will walk with you regardless, and keep growing."

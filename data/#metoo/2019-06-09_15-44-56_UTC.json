The title itself belies any advocacy of, any merit to, quiescence. The book is simultaneously a work of fiction and fact. The characters and the plot are products of both the author\u2019s and readers\u2019 imagination yet represent innumerable, all-too-real, issues throughout contemporary society that confront us all. Stoic endurance is proven to be neither a virtue nor strength of character, but can be a destructive weakness when it becomes embedded into our psyche.\n\nThrough 3d person and intertwined journal entries, combined with narrative commentary, this book has created a unique genre.\n\nThe writing is eloquent in its homespun, gritty, vernacular. An ideal, quick-read, \u201cairplane book\u201d, The Art of Silence\u201d is a moving story on its surface, but deeply thought-provoking in its essence \u2026 \u2018will find it\u2019s a place as a dog-eared reference guide in anyone\u2019s lives as the inevitable challenges of those lives arise. As spectators to the diaries and innermost thoughts of heroes, villains and victims alike, readers immediately become personally involved with the interactive elements self-evaluation, personal motivation and strategic planning necessary to enhance their own quality of life \u2013 to achieve their own self-fulfillment.\n\nFatima Alexander, whether she will admit or not, wrote this book primarily for her courageous son and from her own life experiences. Contrary to her stated intentions of addressing women\u2019s issues and mental health, the principles apply to all genders, among all of humanity. \nShe has identified the distinction between the Mona Lisa and street graffiti.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#healing #women #woman #abuse #couple #victim #goodmorning #metoo #domesticviolenceawareness #help #newbeginnings #selfcare #selflove #fightback #silence #newbook #selfhelpbooks #sisters #bookstagram #books #book #bestseller #survivor #kindle #enough #relationships #marriage #divorce #blackgirlmagic"

Three things:
.

1: I'd like to thank the #metoo movement for being an exclusively white girl "thing", allowing me to engage freely in a brand of 1980 "contractual discourse" .

2: I love JFK, but its baffling that we celebrate him in the absence of his *ardent* and open perversions. He nearly killed marilyn monroe, was a known cheater, and openly drugged women behind their backs. There is a very human narrative here, one we deny bc "heros" can't be mentally Ill. Same thing with Ghandi, that classist, racist pedophile. Same can be said for John Lennon, who *beat women*. Oprah did crack, Maya angelou was a prostitute-turned-madam, and until we get good with "the dark side" a "hero" will never manifest properly, inducing an inhuman shame over natural human complexity, leaving it to pus out of the body in deviant behaviors
.

I know i publicly "lead" with my "bad side", and perhaps this is why I "feel this way". I'm never trying to "teach" anyone anything (im a writer by "learned trade", these are my thoughts; the most uncomfortable "thing" people say to me is that "I'm trying to 'appear' smart "around here". No. I don't even expect people to read this shit), but it's also just reasonable to present your darkest days, on record, keeping triumphs private. The anti-hero is far more alive then the "hero", but we manufacture the opposite -- we want a falsified standard. Its inhuman, creepy and glad to say "I don't suffer that problem"

Slide 3? Me talking to NYU, 9 months on fast forward

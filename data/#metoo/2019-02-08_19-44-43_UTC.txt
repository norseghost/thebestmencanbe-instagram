When I started writing my book I was 14 years old. I collected many articles from the Toronto papers. One of them that always resonated with me I will share with you today. a 12 year old girl once was raped by her grandmother's boyfriend when she was 14 she wrote this poem. Now I lay me down to sleep and in my dreams I shall not weep. And if I die before I wake what kind of legend will I make for my sake? By age 15 she had already given up on life and no one could blame her. The police found her wandering at 3 a.m. down the street with a beer in her hand they also began to know her by the time they went to her high school and confiscated the seven-inch knife. Charge her her mother wanted to get her before the judge so she could get help. But the mother did not understand her daughter's problem at all

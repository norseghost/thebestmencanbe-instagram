I've been feeling like this a lot lately.
Sometimes I use RAINN's support chat because I feel like they actually know how to react to what I tell them. If you feel this way, I would highly reccomend giving RAINN's support chat a shot.
I'm also just a DM away if you feel like you need to talk to someone.

“We meet Rebecca at the tender age of eight as she is exposed to the dark side of humanity for the very first time during the height of the late 90’s drug epidemic. The impact of which left her reeling many years later. Especially so when she entered the world of dating, and met a man who seemed to be a ghost from her past. 
Follow along as Rebecca discovers her resilience after a haunting, abusive past. She not only survives, but thrives with an insurmountable sense of optimism, tenacity and hope.” Candy Apple Butterscotch #metoo #love #feminism #feminist #equality #timesup #trump #women #womenempowerment #girlpower #art #selflove #repost #memes #womensrights #resist #survivor #meme #donaldtrump #maga #motivation #inspiration #america #vote #mentalhealth #believesurvivors

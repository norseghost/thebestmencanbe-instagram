🚨TRIGGER WARNING: This audio clip contains talk about child sexual abuse.🚨
Today I released the fifth episode of my new podcast, A Progressive Perspective, in which I have a conversation with actor, sexual abuse survivor, and activist @NathanSpiteri about the issue of child sexual abuse. Nathan was victimized by a violent pedophile starting when he was eight years old and ending three years later. He recounts his three year relationship with his abuser, his subsequent problems with PTSD and addiction, and how he recovered and has since utilized his experiences to raise awareness about child sexual abuse and how to prevent it. Give the episode a listen via Apple Podcasts/iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, or Stitcher. 🎧

✨I wanted to do something different for you guys✨

So after six hours of video editing 🎞️ from figuring out the best editor for me (I am a beginner and I had no idea what I was doing) to choosing best segments out of three videos, trimming, combining, adding titles, pictures, texts and music I finally managed to squeeze in my 12 minutes videos in 1:53 minutes and produce my FIRST EVER not so perfect but manageable RECIPE VIDEO🎉 to make your lives easy and inspire you to cook because it's the best thing in the world and I want everyone to experience the best!
I really hope you like it 🤗

Cooking sparks joy in my life and I believe it will in your's too✨

P.S. Cooking helped me get through difficult times in life. It helped me almost like meditation. In fact cooking is a form of meditation for me. And now I wish to spread this soul freeing experience. Hope you enjoy the journey.💚 P.S.S. Video editing is not an easy task. Salute to all those humans out there producing video recipes. More respect to them.🙌🏻 Happy fooding humans 😊
Hope you liked my creation 💛

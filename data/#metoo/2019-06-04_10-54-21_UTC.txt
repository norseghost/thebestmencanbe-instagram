Today’s tasks under the dragons:
1) clarify the soft body, tense ankles and wrists relationship; specify centre of chest (a bit to the left) scar initiation; work out the curling unfurling spine dynamic, all in the falling dance;
2) what’s going on in the this-far-and-no-further measuring dance?
3) what am I doing with the head off centre dance which makes me so queasy?

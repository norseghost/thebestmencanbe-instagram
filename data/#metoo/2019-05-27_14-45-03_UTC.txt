To all those weary parents, who can not control their children...
🏵️
My Child, The Explorer...
🏵️
Who are you my child?
I wonder now
As your story unfolds
And you take a bow
🏵️
The curtains are drawn
And the stage is all dark
You my child step in
 to the light of first spark
🏵️
Your light blooms and grows
And the magic unfurls
A smile and laugh
You dance and swirl
🏵️
As if the whole earth
Is your stage and your song 
As an ocean of dreams
Now sweeps you along
🏵️
And a few caring souls
Watch you rise and fall
But the waves are your friends
Beneath it all
🏵️
You don't fear the rythem
Of storm and of sun
You fear not the night
You know day will come
🏵
You heed not the whispers 
Of doubt, fear and risk
You toss off the standards
And blow us a kiss
🏵️
You smile at tomorrow
You laugh at the past
You live in today
For you know it won't last
🏵️
And I set you free
As much as I can
Then I smile quietly
As you reach for my hand
🏵️
We were in this together
It was just yesterday
You were my wild child
Who wanted to play
🏵️
But now you rise up
To test wing and sail
And it matters not now
If you try and you fail
🏵️
For you test the waters
And you tempt the sky
As they call sons and daughters
To swim, sink and fly
🏵️
And I'll hold the kite strings
Until you say '"Let go"
And I'll watch with wonder
It's your sky, it's your show
🏵️
Joy, risk and thunder
My child, take your time
And when you face hunger
Your house, it's still is mine
🏵️
And if you are tired
I'll still tuck you in with a song
And when you are hurting
I'll be that friend that holds on
🏵️
And when you are stuck
And in over your head
I'll toss you a line
And make sure you get fed
🏵️
So you, go be you
For that's what you do best
Your stage just got bigger
Real life is your test
🏵️
Now is your time
To swim, sink and fly
Kid, if you need me
You'll find me near by.
🏵️
Who are you my child?
Explorer and friend
Who you are makes me smile,
As your own life begins.. - Sarah Janisse Brown

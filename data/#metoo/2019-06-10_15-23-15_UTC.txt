We were walking up from the organic urban farm after seeing the chickens for the very first time. Arielle was fascinated with the chicken wire and their clucking. A little girl stopped by to admire their pretty twin faces and sung them a lullaby. As we came nearer to the main hub of the Kinney, you sat on a bench exclusively in the shade.

Coolly. Pappi. Unchanged, from the onset. With thoughts so deep you'd rather just have them remain unspoken. And more grey whiskers than I left you with nearly two years ago. I wonder whether any of them arrived because I ran away?

Behind your shades, I see those intense brown eyes framed by long heavy lashes. I crushed on those the moment I slipped into your cool leather seat that day we drove into the sunset. The rest was history.

You are surprised to see me with a stroller and ask whether they are mine. Twins? You comment "they are beautiful. and so calm". Calm just as you, just as I. And as I have imagined, since learning of their growing limbs inside my inflated belly, that should we have learned of this creation, together, how you might have... I don't know, considered more than a wall, let's say.

When it happened. That moment that my No x100 was smothered by some rotten thing... I closed my eyes and wept silent tears and thought of you. My love. My soul. And the thirty years I had waited and longed to know you.

They were created in an image of love. Not something cruel, criminal and immoral. These two, my two are in some part, our two. Because they were born and raised by my protective soul, that soul that was bound to yours long before we even existed.

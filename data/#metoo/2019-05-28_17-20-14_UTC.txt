In our description, we've created a Go Fund Me page to donate our goal of $1000 to the RAINN Foundation. We've done so much research upon this organization and we felt it was necessary to contribute to their purpose to support and advocate for victims who have suffered sexual assault and suffered from victim blaming. Access their website here: https://www.rainn.org/

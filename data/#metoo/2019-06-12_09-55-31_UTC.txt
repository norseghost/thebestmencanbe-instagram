Off to Shalom: Limmud Sydney this weekend. 
I will be speaking about the personal and public costs and conflicts of the #bringleiferback campaign. 
It's been quite the journey! 
Look forward to seeing you there! -

Malka Leifer, my former school principal is under custody in Israel but is claiming mental illness in order to avoid extradition. 
Meanwhile in Australia she has 74 charges of sexual assault to face and numerous victims waiting for a chance to face her in court. 
It's been found that the corruption reaches all the way to the Israeli Goverment with Health Minister Litzman alleged to have pressured psychiatrists to state Leifer was unfit to stand trial.

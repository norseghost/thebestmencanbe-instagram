This is a Callout for Consent!

I'm here to encourage a more open and honest discussion about what consent looks and sounds like and why that really matters.

I'm here to create a safe environment for people to ask questions about consent, as well as share their personal experiences without judgement.

I'm here to try and show why compassion and empathy for survivors who come forward is so essential.

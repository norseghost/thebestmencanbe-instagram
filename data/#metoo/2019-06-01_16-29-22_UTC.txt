Oluwaseyifunmi Sojinrin-Ajose (@belledhee) says; "I am grateful for so many things especially being married for like 7 months.

However what I am most grateful for is my mother. My mother (Ayoka Sojinrin) is an epitome of beauty, intelligence and perseverance.

I lost my dad since 1995 and my mother has been of great support to myself and my siblings. I am the nineth child of my mother and eighteenth child of my father; the last child of both my mother and father.

I am the only one who attended a private primary and secondary school of all my fatherâ€™s children courtesy of my mother.

I am grateful for her life and she will be 70 by December 13th and I pray that God keeps her for me as I will love to do great things that my father couldnâ€™t do for her."

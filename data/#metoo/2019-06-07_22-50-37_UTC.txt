Contrary to what the first woman I dated identified me as, I AM NOT AN ASSAULTED LESBIAN. I GET TO CLAIM MY OWN FUCKING IDENTITY. ⁣  TW:s/a ⁣
The posts popping up on so many lovely humans’ feeds about claiming your own identity have me feelin all the feels these days. ⁣
⁣
Six years ago, the first woman I dated told me that dating women was a “phase” for me because I am an “assaulted lesbian.” As Maddy explained to me, an assaulted lesbian is a woman who has been assaulted by men and finds safety and security in the arms of women. ⁣
⁣
Newsflash to Maddy: I’ve been assaulted by two of my female partners. Sexual violence does not discriminate. ⁣
⁣
In my experience, the impact of the first intimate relationship with a woman cannot be understated. I was just out, attempting to find love in myself for the parts I’d resented before, and dealing with the commotion of understanding myself while simultaneously trying to help others in my life understand me. It was exhausting. So when Maddy called me an “assaulted lesbian,” I took it. What this very “experienced” lesbian said about my identity must be true. I was a “fake lesbian” trying on a new identity. ⁣
⁣
That phrase, “assaulted lesbian,” still takes the air from my lungs. There is no such thing as an assaulted lesbian. It is one of the most demeaning, undermining, hurtful, and bigoted labels I’ve received, and through all of my transformation, it haunts me. ⁣
⁣
Six years later, I wish I could tell Maddy that her words were inappropriate and dismissing. ⁣
⁣
My love for Chloe was not constructed from the hands of my perpetrators. Our emotional and physical intimacy is not filling a chasm that my traumas left empty. Chloe is my room and space to heal.
⁣
I am not an assaulted lesbian.⁣
⁣
I am a lesbian who has been assaulted. ⁣
⁣
I am a lesbian. ⁣
⁣
I am a survivor. ⁣
⁣
Those identities mingle within my everyday life, but they are by no means a single derogatory label. ⁣
⁣
I was born this way. ⁣
⁣
Not molded this way by the hands of perpetrators. ⁣

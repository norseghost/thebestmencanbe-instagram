@visaleets Indian nationals continue to enjoy 14-day visa-free visit to Hong Kong after successfully completing Pre-arrival Registration (PAR) online. Application for PAR is easy, convenient and free-of-charge. After inputting the required information, the computer system will process the registration automatically and the result will be made known to the registrant instantly. During the period of validity of the registration (six months), successful registrants may visit Hong Kong for multiple journeys, each for a stay of 14 days, by presenting the printout of the PAR notification slip (which the registrants may print immediately upon completion of the registration process) and the same Indian passport used for the registration.

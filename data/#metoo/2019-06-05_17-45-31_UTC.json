The enemy festers in those wounds, blocking you from being healed by the only one who can: JESUS.\n....\nHe is the ultimate physician, the one who can pull you from the ashes of darkness, and heal the wound that\u2019s been bleeding out on life.\n....\nSin separates us from the one who loves us and if you choose, He will reveal what needs to be removed so you can begin walking in freedom with Him. All you have to do is ask... He will tell you what to repent for, and gift you something in return for handing those sins over to Him, at the foot of the cross...\n....\nThis is the way to heal, to mend, and restore. Are you ready?"

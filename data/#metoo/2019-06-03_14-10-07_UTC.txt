In these #MeToo times, Hidden Water is busier than ever! 
Born in NYC five years ago, this organization so dear to our hearts is reaching the limits of their entirely volunteer-run programs, and fundraising for a major moment of growth! 
Founder and Shaman Elizabeth Clemants shares a restorative justice approach that applies the indigenous practice of peacemaking circles to tackle all impacted by childhood sexual abuse. For families to stay together, and communities committed to addressing the root cause of this epidemic, the technique of Healing Circles break the cycle of harm.
By becoming a Founders Circle Member today, you support Hidden Water, and elevate the conversation around CSA toward truth, accountability, wholeness, and the capacity for us all to heal together.

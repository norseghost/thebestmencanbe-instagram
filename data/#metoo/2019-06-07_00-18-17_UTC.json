                        "text": "Ladies: how do you say no?\n.\nWe talk a lot identifying consent, but less about how to say no when you don\u2019t consent. I don\u2019t mean just about sex; I mean saying no to anything, whether it\u2019s upgrading to the deluxe package car wash or volunteering at that charity drive or being teased in a way that you don\u2019t feel comfortable with\n.\nThis is an actual question (all of my questions are actual questions) because I\u2019m realizing that with all of my life experiences, I still have no idea how to say no\n.\nToday a male friend told me I looked nice and squeezed my arm. Whatever, he\u2019s a touchy-feely guy and I like him a lot. But he never half-hugged me when I showed up in sweats. Then he slapped a mosquito off of my leg for me and for some reason, that crossed a boundary with me that I did. not. want.\n.\nNormally I\u2019m all about hugs and touching, but I\u2019ve been through some trauma recently that has left me jittery and very much NOT wanting to be touched by men unless I am reaaally comfortable with them and I initiate it. But I didn\u2019t know how to react. I just froze and and pretended it didn\u2019t happen. Later I thought of a joke I could have made to politely say no, but it happened so fast that I didn\u2019t think of it at the time\n.\nHonestly I almost felt like crying afterwards \u2014 not because my friend is in anyway a bad person, but because I feel like I don\u2019t have control over my own body. I have dressed down my entire life to avoid this kind of attention, but I want to be able to express myself while maintaining control of my body\n.\nSuggestions? Basically every girl I know has been through some similar situation and I want to know how you handle these things \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffdwith strangers, good friends, acquaintances, or family"

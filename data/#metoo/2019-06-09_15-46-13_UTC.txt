As most of you know I am passionate about Health; mind, body, and soul.
Well there was a traumatic experience that derailed me from my health fitness journey and threatened my mental health. 
But God 🙌😭😇
I cried and prayed for something to help me break free from the bondage of fear, doubt, low self-esteem, depression, and addiction to food. 
Well because God always answers prayers he blessed me with a program that will not only assist me in my journey back to mentaphysikal health but allow me to assist others in a way like never before.
 I can help you restore your wings too 👐😇🌸 Join me this summer June 16th as I will begin my 12 week mentaphyzical tranz4mation with my life koach at projekt wings. 
I will be blogging my journey through this 12 week program designed to help all women restore their wings. 
Follow me on IG @canichaswings and witness history in the making. I will share my testimony as a survivor of Domestic violence, Abusive Relationships, as well as lay the blueprint to tranz4m your life.

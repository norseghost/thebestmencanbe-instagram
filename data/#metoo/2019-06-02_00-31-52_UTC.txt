This body, MY body has been through some shit. 
Addiction, bulimia, anorexia, self-mutilation, incarceration, abuse, rape, pregnancies, miscarriages, infertility. 
I have put my body through the ringer, I’ve abused it, hated it, despised it and put my body in the hands of others who did the same. 
I have spent years trying to destroy it & feeling like my body has betrayed me. 
Now, after 39 years on earth, I have never understood how strong my body has been all these years. 
Not until I received these photos, did I appreciate how my body has carried me through the last 2 decades, surviving everything I’ve thrown at it and in it. 
I am here, I am recovering, I am surviving, this is my second chance.

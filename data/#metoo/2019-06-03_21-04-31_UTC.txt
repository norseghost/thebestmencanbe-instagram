Gender equality is on the agenda. In the wake of #MeToo, #TimesUp and global Women’s Marches, the conversation about power imbalance and equality is rippling through the art world. Following on from strong initiatives by Tate Modern and the Uffizi Gallery, now the National Gallery of Australia is campaigning for women artists. Beginning with the Know My Name campaign, the National Gallery of Australia is calling for ‘equal power, equal respect, equal opportunity, and equal recognition for women artists,’ as it rolls out a program of events, new work commissions and exhibitions that put women out front. 
In this interview for Art World Women, Claire Bridge speaks with Alison Wright, Assistant Director of the National Gallery of Australia about their campaign for gender equality and cultural change. (Click the link in the bio to read more)

So who is the man? We\u2019re both women...that\u2019s the point.\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n-\nThe recent attack on the women couple on a London bus is something we have feared and many experience. Horrible for these women, and brave of them to talk.\n-\nSo many assaults and harassments are unreported from fear & unfortunate complacency. It\u2019s another #MeToo movement being talked about amongst queer couples who face this daily.\n-\nAn all too familiar situation. We were harassed verbally in the same way twice by two different male strangers last night while trying to have a drink & out with new friends. Happens most times unless we\u2019re at a gay bar.\n-\nThankfully never physically, but occasions have occurred where we were in danger just by being us. When asked these ignorant questions or requests to kiss, if we feel safe, we ask back, \u201cwould you ask a straight couple that?\u201d, they get all defensive and with a, \u201cof course not, that\u2019s just weird!\u201d, response. Exactly! It\u2019s odd to ask any couple that! Let\u2019s hope its was a teaching moment.\n-\nIs it because many respect a man in a hetero relationship, but when no man is present, the respect goes out the window? It\u2019s sad, annoying and scary.\n-\nOur love is valid & real. Our private life is ours to keep that way. We only kiss when we want to & feel safe to do so.\n-\nAnd as for the whole \u201cstraight pride\u201d argument floating around... You go ahead with that... but first, lets strip away your straight rights to marry the person you love, basic healthcare, child-rearing, adoption, education, safety, religious freedom, military service, employment & basic services. How about when planning a holiday you begin googling what countries won\u2019t kill you for traveling there with your partner?\n-\nHappy Pride. \ud83c\udf08\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n#seekingmars #pridemonth #pride"

I'm not sure why this still bears repeating but it does.

IVAC is a Quebec government crime victim compensation program. To blow my American friends and families minds, they will pay for your physical or psychological therapy if you were the victim of a crime as well as massage and yoga for stress (PTSD) and self-defence classes. Amazing right?

Their initial evaluation still asks female assault victims about what they were wearing. In other words, Quebec is willing to reimburse you for the dress you got ripped off you during an assault but not put more resources toward the seriously understaffed sexual assault unit at SPVM. Where are our priorities? #believewomen

#Metoo and Beyond: Centering the AAPI Experience .

Thank you teammates for being and building with us!! San Jose, you are amazing. Stay tuned to see where our next Movement Building Series 2.0 will be. You energize and inspire us to continue creating safe spaces for self-identified AAPI women to listen and/or share their narratives! Thank you!
.

Please tag yourselves and let us know what you thought about the launch! . (Image description: 20 Asian + Pacific Islander women standing and sitting in three rows holding healing candles).

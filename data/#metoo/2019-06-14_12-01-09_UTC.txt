Cultures cause harm. Our culture has normalized behaviors, beliefs and ways of life that have harmed and CONTINUE TO HARM so many people, Both individually and as a group.⠀
.⠀
When you experience a "normalized" belief it might feel right or wrong, but you have no idea how to feel or do differently. Everyone is doing it... So, this is what I do.⠀
.⠀
It becomes HARMFUL or TRAUMATIC when it doesn't allow for an individual or group's safety. It physically changes your belief system moving you towards acting in response to the trauma or harm regularly. This shows up in lots of places, emotions, groups and relationships. ⠀
.⠀
Some of the "normalized" things that cause harm - ⠀ ~ Thinking our experience is the ONLY experience⠀ ~ Individualism instead of community⠀ ~ Fatphobie and a belief that smaller bodies are healthier, happier and more successful ⠀ ~ Racism⠀ ~ Anti-LGBTQ, Anti-Semitism, Anti-Muslim, etc.⠀ ~ Ableism⠀ ~ Privilege⠀ ~ Sexism - Rape/lack of consent ~ Religious judgment or persecution, both inward and outward⠀ ~ Shame⠀ ~ Wellness industry⠀ ~ Mental Health Stigma⠀ ~ not talking about Domestic Violence⠀ ~ This list continues....I know this list really long. And that SUCKS.⠀
.⠀
We have all experienced this at different levels and it takes a lot of work to pull it apart from who we are. We have to UNLEARN to RELEARN. If we truly want to allow healing, we have to look at healing our cultures, our norms, our systems. They are traumatic and harmful for US. For some, more than others (google intersectionality and Kimberle Crenshaw). IT IS NOT OK. We can do better!⠀

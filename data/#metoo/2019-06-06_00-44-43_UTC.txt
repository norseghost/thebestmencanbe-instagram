*Trigger warning*
•
As time has gone on I have realized that my story is really unique-and I think I was put here to share all of my pain- to be a steward, in a way.
I’m here to be a lamplighter and to help others move through things that feel impossible-
because I have survived impossibly terrible things.
•
Ten years ago I walked into a police station to report the person who abused me because I wanted to protect his adopted daughter. Maybe if I spoke up, it could save her
•
They told me they couldn’t investigate his relationship with her based on my claims alone.
It felt like my voice wasn’t heard and more importantly it seemed as though this evil man was just walking free. It f*cking sucked.
•
Good news: just because he walks free doesn’t mean i can’t dedicate the rest of my life to speaking about it.
Tonight I’m sharing a little bit about the abuse I went through and how Trauma Sensitive Yoga has helped me.
•
Please share if this resonates!
Also: If you are an abuse survivor I want to tell you that you never walk alone-
that you are strong and resilient and loved; 
that what happened to you does not define you.

(Lastly-this is a still from the YouTube vid, which I filmed from my hallway floor. I’m nervous smiling. And a little awkward. You know? But at least I’m talking about it 🙎‍♀️)

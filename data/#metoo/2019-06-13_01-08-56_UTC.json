                        "text": "In women, there is an authentic empowerment & love for ourselves + others that organically emerges when shame is unveiled. Shame is a concealed, contagious, & self-deteriorating emotion. It detours you from the truth of who you are at your essence\ud83d\udc51\n\u2800\u2800\nYou\u2019ll notice in very small children, there will be an innate sense of freedom & innocence in their bodies & self image. As we've grown up in society, we've soaked up the strong underlying current of immense shame for our bodies & womanhood. Since we don't meet the expectations of advertisements, media, & porn, we assume \"something must be wrong with me. I'm not enough. I am too much.\" Each part of our body has a different story about how it should be more perfect. And through socialization, we are affirmed some of this, creating even deeper wounds\ud83d\udc94\n\u2800\u2800\nSo of course it makes total sense that we forget the truth. We forget our unique beauty. We forget our worthiness. We forget our belonging. We forget we are imperfectly perfect. We forget our unconditional love. We forget our power.\n\u2800\u2800\nWe long to remember \nbecause at our core, we do remember!\u2728\n\u2800\u2800\n\ud83c\udf1cWe remember when we give the different parts of ourselves the love they need.\n\ud83c\udf1cWe remember when we choose our own story about human bodies, sensuality, & sexuality.\n\ud83c\udf1cWe remember when we create embodied experiences in our physical reality that affirm our body\u2019s intelligence & normality.\n\ud83c\udf1cWe remember when we see the unique beauty in women and when they see the unique beauty within us.\n\ud83c\udf1cWe remember when we receive & give loving support to our insecurities & judgments.\n\u2800\u2800\nLet's re-remember the truth together. We did not come to this earth forgetting. We came knowing. It's within us.\ud83d\udc6d\ud83d\udc6d\ud83d\udc6d\n\u2800\u2800\nIf you resonate with all of this, @peacheee & I would love to co-create with you\u2661\nWhat: Nude Yoga Circle for Women\nWhen: July 20, 2019 at 6:30pm\nWhere: Redondo Beach, CA at @harmonyyogarb\nFor more information click to my profile\u2661\n\u2800\u2800\nIf you feel called to give support, I would greatly appreciate if you could share this post/event to your story so that all women who are deeply craving this work can find it\ud83d\ude4f\u263a\ufe0f"

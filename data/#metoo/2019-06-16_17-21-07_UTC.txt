HELP MAKE STRANGULATION A FELONY AND STEP PARENTS PROTECTED UNDER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS IN EVERY STATE!

The biggest tragedy is these kids can‚Äôt openly love all their parents. She has gone out of her way to use their daughter to hurt us. She has tried to destroy his relationship with his kids. She tried to end my life because she is the ‚Äúmother‚Äù and only her relationships matter. When these holidays come around it‚Äôs front and center for me. The step dad was asked by the court to not discipline, to not be home and around when the mom got visitation they all had to reunification therapy. We haven‚Äôt seen her really in almost two years and everyone thinks it‚Äôs ok. Fast forward four years she still tries to drive us all apart. All the people involved contributed to this. All parents matter in a kids life and honestly the more people they have loving and caring for them the more successful they will be. The single cause of our trauma is mental illness and distorted ideas about reality. No one was trying to steal anyone‚Äôs daughter. No one was trying to destroy anyone‚Äôs relationships before this happened. What was happening was a refusal to co-parent, delusional beliefs and a real lack of reality along with complete misperception of what her daughter was going through. The reality we have today and the separation that still continues is tragic. These kids should feel free to love everyone in their lives as much as they want.

“If the wind changes your face will stay like that” 😛

Not everything you hear is the truth.

Not everything you tell yourself is either.

Inside everyone’s head is a storyteller. Your own little narrator.

They don’t tell the beautiful details of your day to day life like your favourite romantic movie.

Oh no.. what they do is offer an opinion on everything.

Everything you have done in the past, everything you want to do in the future and all that in between.

And this story teller isn’t always your friend.

So you have to be aware of what story you are allowing in.

Are you the bad guy?

Are you the one who can’t do it so may as well give up?

Or are you the hero?

I’m going to guess more often then not the little narrator makes you the villain.

So what if we replaced those stories, with ones that were more empowering?

Here are some things you can do to make your storyteller your number 1 fan:

1. Be aware of narrator and the story he is telling you - It all starts with awareness. Bringing it into your consciousness rather than being oblivious to how many negative stories you are hearing inside your own head everyday.

2. Write down what he says - Try to get it word for word. The chances are, it won’t be the first time you’ve heard that line, whether it be ‘I’m not  good enough’, ‘I’m so lazy’ or ‘I’ll never be able to do it’. Ask yourself: what is the story I am telling myself right now?

3. Time for evaluation! - it’s easy to get caught up in the story and believe it’s the truth. But it’s only one prospective, usually based on fear and previous experiences.

Ask yourself: is this story just a limiting belief? Am I holding back to protect myself?

4. Truth bomb - most people doubt their beliefs and believe their doubts. They make the fears the truth!

Ask yourself: What do I know to be true?

5. Time to write a new story - what if you could do the things you want? Hit your goals and create the experiences you crave?

Ask yourself: what do you really want? Maybe write your dream day? Or do your vision board?

Find out what’s important to you and start creating the story of the life you want, not listening to the voice of fear inside your head ❤️

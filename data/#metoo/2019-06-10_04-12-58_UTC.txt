HEED THIS MESSAGE!! WE’RE BAAAACK!! 💁🏼‍♀️And we need YOU!

We at Heed want to break the stigma that rape and sexual assault shouldn’t be discussed, and to ultimately shed the shame women feel surrounding those traumatic incidences. We are unapologetic, unashamed and we exist ✌🏼 #shedtheshame #unashamed

After a few months of discussing how to progress with Heed following a run of successful peer support groups, it is our pleasure to be back supporting our sisters! We understand that getting yourself to our sessions can be difficult so for the time being, we want to hear from YOU how we can help as we try to raise awareness in Hampshire and the surrounding areas!  SO! What would you want to see from a project such as Heed? What can we do to get you involved? Would you prefer a closed online forum to discuss issues? Q&A’s? How about events to build confidence? Monthly meet ups, possibly doing a fun activity? Arts and crafts? Self defence? WHAT can we DO to help?! We have had overwhelming support from the public, but we need to explore different avenues to the weekly sessions to ensure we are making the most amount of difference, in the most accessible and considerate way. Help us help you, please get in touch and be sure to keep up to date with us for more. 
Thank you!! 🤗👌🏼💕 #heed #heedempoweringwomen #unashamed #letstalk #womensrights #metoo #standup #speakout #whatdoyouthink #youropinionmatters #basingstoke #basingstokecommunity #communitysupport #womensequality #basingstokeanddeane #femaleempowerment #strongwomen #hampshire #empoweredwomen #empoweredwomenempowerwomen #girlpower #itsoknottobeok

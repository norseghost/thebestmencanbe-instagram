Could not have said it better! Thank you @theequalityinstitute for putting my feelings into simple words. For all the men out there getting defensive and getting riled up about the unfairness to them. Take a second and think why that is.

While I talk about sexual harassment, I often get replies from men about the fear they have to live in now because of #metoo and they have to watch their steps and actions. It shocks me that I have to handle such conversations but all I can say to them is ; if watching your actions is what you need to do. Then do it. Because if a part of you feels fear about your action, then you know you are doing something wrong.  #Repost @theequalityinstitute with @get_repost

It is on all of us to talk about men’s violence. No matter who we are or where we come from, we all have a role to play in creating change.

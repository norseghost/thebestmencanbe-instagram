MEL GIBSON became persona non grata in Hollywood in 2006, after first spewing a string of anti-Semitic comments while he was being arrested on DUI charges and then pleading no contest to hitting the mother of his child.

But in 2017, Gibson appeared at the Oscars as a nominee for Best Director, grinning happily in the front section. And later on it was announced that Gibson is set to co-write and direct a remake of The Wild Bunch for Warner Bros. Heâ€™s back in now. AMAZING!

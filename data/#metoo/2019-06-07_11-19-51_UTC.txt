Since Isaac’s birth 10 months ago, I’ve been contemplating a lot about how to bring up a boy to be his true best self in a world defined by serial sexual predators like Harry Weinstein and the mainly female-led #metoo movement - basically a society demonised by gender inequality and sexual harrassment and rape.

Some Instagram posts tagged around the topic range from “how much of little terrorists sons can be when they are toddlers“ to “how do we stop our boys becoming rapists”! The moms discussing such topics - in my opinion - don’t understand how damaging it is to reinforce such negative stereotypes of what boys are and can be.

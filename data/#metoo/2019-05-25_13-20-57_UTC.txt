#Bartalk Episode 23 will probably be my most unpopular vocal opinion to date. I’m taking a chance by voicing these words with the hopes that women, men, and all humans see the kindness, honesty, and good intent behind the words. For years I’ve sat with other likeminded men and talked about our love and attraction to women. We talk about likes and dislikes and I found the common denominator is that we are visual creatures that get our heads turned daily whether it’s on social media or in the streets when we see gorgeous curves. But there is a large difference in criteria between choosing to double tap a picture or video and choosing a soulmate to share life with. We also feel like women may be confused about what we deem extra when it comes to the one we want to be with and who we may want to be with for the moment. We are simple creatures that love simplicity in a complex world. With that said, watch, share, comment, kill the messenger, message, or voice your own opinion with dignity. It’s all about #thoughtfood •

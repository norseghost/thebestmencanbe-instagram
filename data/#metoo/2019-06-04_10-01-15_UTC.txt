There is one week to go until the memorial sculpture 'Mother and Child', in honour of all victims of sexual violence around the world, will be unveiled.

The sculpture has been designed, created and made by Rebecca Hawkins and will be unveiled by Nadia Murad, the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize Winner, at Church House, Westminster.

Jack Straw, international ambassador for JLDH, has said; "This is a fitting tribute to all victims of sexual violence, and especially the Lai Dai Han and their mothers who have for so long been crying out for recognition of their plight by the Government of South Korea." ðŸ‘‰ http://bit.ly/jldhevent

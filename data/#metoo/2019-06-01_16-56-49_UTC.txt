June 1st is Narcissistic Abuse Awareness Day. One of the best things that has come out of my account is sharing some of the hardest things i've been through with all of you. I've never talked about these things before and not only did i help myself but i helped others and i've helped inform parents that its not always the friends creepy uncle, sometimes its the older siblings friends you need to watch out for. I was abused for 6 years as a child by someone only 5 years older than me. It took me until last year to learn that what i went through wasnt okay and was abuse and the trauma i had endured and my feelings about it were valid.  I'm so glad i've been able to talk to the parents on here that i have and help them, whether its warning signs of a narcissist, warning signs that abuse might be happening or warning signs of mental health problems, i've actually helped people and thats all i've ever wanted to do. If you've been abused, physically, mentally, emotionally either as a child, an adult or like many of us, both, then just know you arent alone and there are so many people you can reach out to. What you are feeling is valid and what happened, no matter how long ago was not okay. Abuse isnt love. It never was love. Say it again (cause i need to also); Abuse isn't love.

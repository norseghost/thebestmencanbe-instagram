On the streets in dark horrifying nights, I find the screaming reminisces
As a homeless thought turns over half-naked
My shriek turns into a sigh
When sleep sneaks in, drowsiness multiplies
There’s an echo of horrors that stay up all night
In closed AC compartments of moving trains, 
In buses, in cars, in summers, in rains
In a jungle, in a temple, in stalker’s domain
In an uncle’s lap, awaiting blood-stain
The muffled dreams breathe their last once again. 
And we hope it’s the last battle I’ll have to fight
And you defend my honor with all your might
There’s a blot on his conscience he’ll never recite
In slam poetries, in novels, 
In pictures, they crawl up,
My art has to swallow
Everything that will follow
There’s a shadow upon me, I can’t say its name
If I say #MeToo it’ll be a blame game
So I’ll shout out from the darkest abyss 
Throwing curses at you, like the name that was his
And as you plunge in with light, hoping to save me
I’ll stand with my sisters and say we already braved it. -Artlexicons .

Right now there is a war on women and AFAB individuals everywhere. I have always been passionate about this topic, being extremely pro-abortion and pro-choice. However now is the time to stand to call. 
If you are for women, you're for abortion. Nearly 1 every 4 women have had an abortion. You know someone who has had an abortion. We are not just your vessles. Think as you will, but we will never get rid of abortion, only safe Abortion. A baby is not alive until it breaths it's first breath, (according to the Bible anyways.) We are not a theocracy. State and Church are separate. Nobody HAS to get an abortion, but anyone who is pro-life, is taking away thoes who NEED an abortion. Litterally nobody on this planet wakes up and says, "y'know? One day, I wanna have an abortion." Have a nice day. If you've had an abortion, I hear you, I see you, you're not alone. .

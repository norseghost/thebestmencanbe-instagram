                        "text": "In my life I was committed to family and sports but I realized I had no true committment to myself. I was in a constant state of SURVIVAL. \nSilently, I was moving through the world doing whatever I could to survive...constantly questioning whether to speak my truth or bite my tongue, settling for less and doing whatever it took to make people happy.\n\nThen a friend practicing Ramadan, going foodless, praying consistently, during the longest days of the year (summer) I saw what was possible in a human and in ME as a man. \nI saw committment. I saw dedication. I saw integrity. I saw honor...when NOONE is looking. I saw the ability to be a superstar when the lights were off. He may not have seen it that way...but I did.\n\nYou may call it Ramadan, I saw it as a practice of committment and wondered to myself if I could do the same. \nGo without food. \nBe in a deep state of prayer daily.\nHold myself to a higher committment, my personal growth.\n\nI decided I could, however I was conflicted by the religious aspect, since I wasnt Muslim. I asked myself, \"What if you did it on your own, at your own time and in your own way?\" I asked him about the practice. The reason, the teachings, the purpose. He broke it all down to me in the easiest way I could understand...COMMIT that's it.\n\nI appreciated the break down. I sat on it for a while. Then I got reassigned from that job to somewhere closer to my place.\n\nSo I called him up one day and he asked me \"What's good in life, love money?\" I told him \"I got fired!\ud83e\udd23 But I'm in a new relationship.\" He was like \"Damnnnnn man, congrats!\" I said \"Yeah man, its dope.\" Before I hung up I told him \"By the way, I'm bout to start fasting in January. No food sun up to sun down. No alcohol. No SEX!\" He was like \"Ok, Ok! I see you.\" His acknowledgment meant alot. It reminded how much making the committment was acknowledging myself. \nI started fasting for the month of January, 2004. (15 years)\n\nI have been fasting EVERY January EVER since.\n\nPeople ask me if the practice is \"religious\", I smile..because many can't understand devotion without religion. So I say yeah.\n\nMy \"RELIGION\" is my \"COMMITTMENT\"\n\nAsh\u00e8-Amen"

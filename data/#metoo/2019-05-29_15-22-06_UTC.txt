The most loved I have ever felt by God was when he freed me from being a victim, which allowed me to heal and have this just be a chapter in my story. ❤️For those who feel the same, I celebrate with you.
👏🏽For those on the  journey of healing, I applaud you for your bravery, and I’m rooting for you.
❤️ For those still trying to find the strength to even start, I’m hopeful for you, and encourage you to seek help, because you have so much more to your story.  #supportsurvivors #metoo #churchtoo #mentoo #victornotvictim #yourstorymatters #endabuseeverywhere #jesusheals

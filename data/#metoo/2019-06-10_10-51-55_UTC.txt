so hey I am @shivaangi_sings the song that you are hearing is a 
SELF COMPOSED SONG
I am 17 years old Indian girl who can't step out alone of the house after 8pm because she fears to be raped and then thrown in an alley or a gutter.

women safety in India is so horrible that it seems SARCASTIC when people say it's getting better.

If I wear what I want to I would get creepy looks or comments walking down the road. Everyday when I am leaving my house seems like a gamble. If these people can rape kids less than 5 years old then what  am I to them!? although women compromise of 50% of the vote bank our thoughts, our needs,our issues are far from being addressed. This song symbolises my fears, sadness and anger towards these damn rapists.

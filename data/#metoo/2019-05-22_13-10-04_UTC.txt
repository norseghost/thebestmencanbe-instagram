Reposted from @typingfeminism -  Thanks to women who fought one day, we are where we are now ✊ Kirsten Schwenzer is clear about it with this beautiful design 💜 @kirstenmakesthings

Kirsten is a graphic designer based in Detroit, MI. She primarily works in branding and packaging, but keeps a regular lettering practice on the side because it’s always been something she’s loved doing. She works hard to give her two cats, Oakley and Bianchi, the lives they deserve 😻

Stay tuned because we'll be sharing new feminist artworks daily ♀️🔥

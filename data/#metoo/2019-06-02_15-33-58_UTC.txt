If you don't know yet, I made an animation telling Aly Raisman's life story so far. The link is in my bio, you should check it out! I constructed everything single thing in the animation and I'm so proud of how it came out. So I wanted to share some of the work that went into it. These are some of my favorite items that I created for this project. The camera at the photoshoot and her book.

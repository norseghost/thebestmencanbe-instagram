We are not objects. “We were dating at the time. He was my first boyfriend so I was still learning how to be a ‘good’ girlfriend, which I soon confused with giving in to him always asking for sex. On three separate occasions, I was woken up by him thrusting inside me. The first time I pulled away, told him ‘no’, ‘stop’. The second time I kept pushing his hands off me. The third time I just lay there crying, unable to say anything, unable to move, unable to protest.”

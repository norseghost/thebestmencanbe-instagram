A few weeks ago I was catcalled. Sad to say, it has happened to me so many times that I'm numb to it already. But something about that recent incident really shook me to my core. There was this stranger, a sad excuse for a human being, who felt he had every right to act the way he did.

He taunted me and disrespected me and the worst part, he was confident that he'd get away with it. And he did. Because I let him. He sneered and just drove away without me even uttering a single word. No fiesty rebuttal or a violent retort to put him in his place. I froze. I was speechless and I was genuinely scared. I always thought that I was a tough person but at that time, I just felt humiliated and defeated coz I allowed myself be a victim of that pig. But never again.

I don't ever want to feel helpless and weak. So I'm channeling all my anger and frustration into something that will enable me to fight back. I'm not a victim. I'm not another #MeToo!

Day 190 in benzo withdrawal: .
.
Oh my gosh, can I just say I’m extremely happy to be back home with my cat and here with my recovery friends and away from normal people now? Sheesh. I had to go to a friends birthday pool 🏊🏼‍♀️ party today and oh my... I’m just wiped out completely from pretending. There I was trying to appear “normal” to people I haven’t seen in almost a year because I’ve been withdrawing from years and years of so many big pharma meds which include Benzos, Opiates, stimulants, muscle relaxants, diet pills.. and the list goes on. The tone was immediately set with an unnecessary, slightly bitchy comment from my best girlfriend’s wife about how I have been acting in recovery which I’m not going to entirely go into because it still stings. But I didn’t completely understand the nature of what she said and I was hurt by her comment, So I just kept to myself most of the day while still trying to be a supportive friend. I spent most of the time in the pool playing with the kids instead of mingling with the adults because I just didn’t feel like socializing on an adult level. Much of the time was also spent with me silently floating on my back in the pool so that my ears were fully submerged to try and mask all of the noise as I am still very sensitive to a lot of sound and especially people’s voices. Apparently it is quite common for people to be sensitive to the sound of other people’s voices while going through benzo withdrawal. At any rate, I survived. I just am so happy to be in complete silence now. Well, in complete silence with my white noise. I felt very overstimulated but all in all needed to push myself a little bit further out of my comfort zone and try socializing. My muscles are so freakin sore and feel like jelly from treading water all day. But a good sore. I’m so glad to be back in a place where I don’t have to pretend and am very thankful for all of y’all’s support and allowing me to be myself in recovery. 🧡 🙏🏼 .

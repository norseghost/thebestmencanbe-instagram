GRATITUDE SUNDAY.  My son posted this in his InstaStory yesterday and it REALLY DEPICTS how I feel when I think about GOD now.  I AM has created for me a place to sleep in HIS LAP. I stretch out my arms to get really snuggled and comfortable while MY HEAVENLY FATHER STRAPS ME IN CLOSE for safety and security . This loving act from ABBA secures my heart in PEACE.  I live in GRATITUDE SUNDAY every day, but in particular today because PAPA GOD has brought me through many many many sunsets and sunrises and disappearing horizons and scorched equators. TODAY,  I AM has strapped me so closely and encourages me to sleep in HIS LAP!  #IAM #GODISMYFRIEND #weareone #hope #faith #comforter #waymaker #cloud #horizon #sunset #sunrise #beginning #end #beautiful #sleepingdog #myson #gratitude #sunday #rest #chronicillness #mentalillness #depression  #ptsd #metoo #fibromyalgia #peace

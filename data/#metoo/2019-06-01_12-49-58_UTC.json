Some brilliant one liners included! \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2022The Dream Thieves - 4\ud83c\udf1f\u2019s\u2063\n\u2022Blue Lily, Lily Blue - 3\ud83c\udf1f\u2019s\u2063\n\u2022The Raven King - 4\ud83c\udf1f\u2019s\u2063\n- I struggled to see the hype of this series in book one so much I waited ages to continue, I fell in love with Ronan in book two but still struggled, book three felt weaker than book two to me but is that because I loved the focus on Ronan\u2019s arc? Maybe. But after reading The Raven King and looking back on the series as a whole - I completely understand the hype of the series, it was amazing\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2022Half Bad - 3\ud83c\udf1f\u2019s - Interesting premise but it seemed to take a while to get off the ground and running \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2022The Alchemist - 2\ud83c\udf1f\u2019s - the message this story sends out, I don\u2019t believe which is probably why I didn\u2019t like it \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2022The Nowhere Girls - 4\ud83c\udf1f\u2019s - I cried because of the reality this book addresses in terms of #MeToo and \u2018boys will be boys\u2019, the message it sends at the end is important and I really adored the book. \u2063\n\u2063\nReread - \u2063\n\u2063\nSix of Crows - 5\ud83c\udf1f\u2019s - I LOVE MY GANG \u2063\n\u2063\n#sixofcrows #wickedsaints #theorphangeofgods #aurorarising #thebridetest #topsecret #vicious #halfbad #thenowheregirls #thealchemist #theravencycle #thedreamthieves #bluelilylilyblue #therave"

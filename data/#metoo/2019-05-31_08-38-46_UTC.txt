I'm just ouchea loving @richardscottartist new artwork, celebrating the female body... .

but also dreaming of a world where I can walk down the street in this miniskirt, without being sexually harrassed or catcalled... . *sigh* when will you men stop? (Disclaimer: not all, but definitely a large majority of you)

#MeToo every single day of my life!!!! . ðŸ“¸ @saintliam

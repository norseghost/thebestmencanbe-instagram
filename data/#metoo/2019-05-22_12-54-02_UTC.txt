Wow!!!! You might say, the liberal hoards of Hollywood are finally speaking up for unborn humans! Well, you would be WRONG. The newest star studded PSA is talking about CHICKENS üêì. Yes the demented Hollywood crowd is concerned that McDonalds doesn‚Äôt treat chickens the way they should. Now, no one is in favor of animal mistreatment, but to use your celebrity to ‚Äúspeak‚Äù for chickens and still be in favor of UNRESTRICTED abortion  up to birth (and even after birth, if an abortion ‚Äúfails‚Äù and the baby is actually born alive) is INSANITY. Unborn human beings have their own bodies, organs, DNA & set of human rights, if they were allowed to be born. To deny them the most basic right of life is against everything a civil and just society stands for. CHICKENS over children???? Really??? Think about it. #costsofabortion, #blm, #arianagrande, #prolife, #prochoice, #plannedparenthood, #operationrescue, #kimkardashian, #michelleobama, #naral #blacklivesmatter, #oprah, #berniesanders, #katyperry, #life, #metoo , #kanyewest, #justinbieber, #abortionrights, #abortion, #now, #annehathaway, #youknowme

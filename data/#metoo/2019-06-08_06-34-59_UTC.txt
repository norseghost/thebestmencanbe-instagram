In 2018, one of my male coworkers at TripAdvisor touched my breasts and thighs. The first incident occurred when I was wearing my mother’s gifted Indigenous madellion. He grabbed my necklace, and then rested his hands on my breast before saying, “Nice necklace.” At that moment, I was shocked, disgusted and felt extremely uncomfortable. Therefore, I tried to ignore the situation. But, then, he decided to approach me in the breakroom. This time around, we sat under a camera. He proceeded to reach his fingers towards my thigh/hip and said, “You have a string right here.” I was extremely shocked because I had told this same person verbally to please respect my space. As a result, on April 11, 2018, at 7:11 am, I sent this male coworker a “HipChat” message. I requested the following, in summary, “Please respect my personal space. I’ve tried ignoring and keeping my distance. But this time, I will message you directly.” Days afterward, he never responded to my message. A year later, and he still never responded to my message with a sorry or acknowledgment. I filed a complaint with Human Resources. He's now in management.

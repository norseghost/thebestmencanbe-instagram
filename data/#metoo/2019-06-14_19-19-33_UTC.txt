Leading edge conversations on co-creating a new paradigm of harmony for all humanity... My body is tingling, I'm sweating and my blood is flowing with fire from within. Oooooopf!!! Holding circle with two powerful and open men, reflecting on and feeling into the deconstruction of the patriarchy and how collective conversations about victims and perpetrators have shamed and damaged us all... And leaning into big and scary and vulnerable questions about where we go from here and how we want to show up for ourselves and each other in building a new world of harmony and balance of yin and yang within our own ecosystems and in the collective ecosystem. This conversation turns me on from the deepest plane!!! More of this to come ❤️❤️❤️ In the meantime, I would love to know... What is your experience with the current cultural dialogue around the rise of the divine feminine and the deconstruction of patriarchy? #metoo... How does this conversation make you feel?

Photos: me standing on the symbolic thin line between masculine and feminine expression that has been co-constructed by the collective under the guise of evolution and progress. And reflecting, while trying to walk that line, on the way a river flows through a canyon in fluid motion, with ease, grace and complete trust in where it is going, no matter how many bends it takes along the way.

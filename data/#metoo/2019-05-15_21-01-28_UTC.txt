We love helping, but we also realize we are not the only organization helping in the fight against human trafficking. There are many more organizations and people working towards ending modern day slavery. Today we wanted to take the time to highlight a few:

A21: Reach (Reduce Vulnerability to Trafficking), Rescue, and Empowerment of Survivors
Dressember: Fashion Activism to Combat Human Trafficking
Polaris Project: Education, Human Trafficking Hotline, Resources

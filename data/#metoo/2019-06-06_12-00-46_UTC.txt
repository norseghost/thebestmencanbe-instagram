🎥FILM OF THE WEEK: 'Frantz' (2016) by Francois Ozon. "It’s a subtle, surprisingly subdued film. But what I admired the most is the way Ozon uses seemingly garish cinematic trickery –like the colour changing from austere black & white to ravishing red within a single shot– to create such a profound, sublime effect." Director Marina Shron on why 'Frantz' must be on your watchlist!🍿

The essence of L💜Ve is “Self L💜Ve”
as you’ll be spending the rest of your life with you.

When we examine what we want for ourselves the first thing we look at is L💜Ve, but we are so busy in our heads thinking that the L💜Ve has to be from external sources 1st like our life partners, when we should be giving ourselves Self L💜Ve 1st so we know what we deserve and need and add to our soul that amazing twin flame and connection of two souls as one. 
Don’t settle for L💜Ve, set the standards as you are the beckon and embodiment of what you want , live in Self  L💜Ve everyday and invite only L💜Ve in your scared space and soul. 
The lesson of Self L💜Ve will carry you on your journey in life so set your soul up for only L💜Ve that’s 100% in line with your souls journey

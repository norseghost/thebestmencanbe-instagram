Latoni Daniel is currently incarcerated, impregnated while incarcerated, and in the state of ALABAMA!!! Not only is she due at the end of this month, but her Glow day is 5/24/19. I am asking all of my supporters who are interested in writing letters and sending cards to Latoni to comment “I stand with Latoni” or dm me and I will provide her information. Let’s come together and shower her with love and support during this time!

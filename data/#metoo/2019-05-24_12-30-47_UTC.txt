ðŸŽ¥FILM OF THE WEEK: 'The Headless Woman' (2010) by Lucrecia Martel "The filmâ€™s style expresses the state of semi-consciousness â€“that we have grown so dangerously accustomed to!â€“ with such visceral power, it makes you want to scrub your head violently from the inside â€“ to scrape away the dirt and the grime that prevents you from seeing clearly." â€“Marina Shron

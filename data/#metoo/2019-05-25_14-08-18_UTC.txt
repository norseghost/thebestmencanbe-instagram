This verse is ➖EVERYTHING➖ after leaving a toxic relationship. Too often women find themselves in a cycle of toxic relationships. It is ➖NEVER ➖ your fault for the toxic traits of others, however it is up to you to ➖BREAK THE CYCLE.➖ Actively commit to the wellness of your soul, mind, and body before making yourself available again. You are less likely to enter another toxic relationship when you take the time to properly ➖HEAL ➖ from the trauma you endured. ⠀

The trailer of Super 30 starring Hrithik Roshan as the mathematician Anand Kumar is here. Watch via our stories.
The film is based on the training programme initiated by math wizard Anand Kumar that coaches 30 deserving and economically limited students free of cost in Patna, Bihar for IIT-JEE entrance exams every year with a commendable success rate. Anand Kumar who was born into a very poor family in the Indian state of Bihar and believes genius can succeed given the opportunity.
Copious amounts of tanning lotion for Hrithik Roshan in a really bad attempt to look like Kumar and a clean chit by Reliance for director Vikas Bahl in the Me Too scandal with his credit now appearing in the trailer title are the highlights of the Super 30 trailer. Bahl was called out by his own partners at Phantom Films over sexual misconduct with an employee.
But the ones who shine in the trailer are the young students who represent the potential of India. The film is all set to hit the screens on 12 July 2019. #filmtribe

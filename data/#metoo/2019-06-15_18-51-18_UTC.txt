I don’t normally post these kind of things, but after reading Sophie’s post yesterday I had to. It infuriates me that it is 2019 and people still think that’s it’s okay to comment on someone else’s body. The media treat celebrities as if they weren’t human beings like the rest of us and that they don’t have feelings. Sophie is beautiful on the inside and outside. She’s extremely talented and versatile. She’s sweet and cares about others, but unfortunately the media and trolls don’t consider this to be of importance. There are enough horrible things going on in the world and I would never want to contribute to making someone else feel worthless. Please think twice before you say something. Let’s try this world a better place because right now I’m ashamed of it. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> #girl #pretty #beautiful #summer #ariana #followforfollow #metoo #timesup #friends #bestfriends #Netflix #australia #spamforspam #like #love

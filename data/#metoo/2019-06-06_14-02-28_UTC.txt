This girl finished 8th grade and is about to enter into High school! What?!?! We got to spend the day with her yesterday and celebrate her at her favorite place. (Had to include the stink face, Boo. You’re still cute!) #sorrynotsorry😂 #bookworm #shelovesbooks #metoo 🙋🏻‍♀️🥰 I’m so proud of you @blooming_faith19 !

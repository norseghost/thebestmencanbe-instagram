Another chapter written in my journey of healing... this adventure started months ago when I met @kalani_creutzburg and he challenged me to be more. So I took a leap of faith and signed up for @choicecenter . This past week has been intense, emotional and psychologically draining and incredibly eye opening. I originally thought I'd go with the intent to find out what I'm lacking in rebuilding my company @together.as3point.one  but instead found so much more! 
Phase one: Discovery... One thing I discovered was that I am not there for my kids like I thought I was. I'm too busy trying to be super mom that I was not present for my kids when I was PHYSICALLY with them. I was using my trauma as an excuse of why I couldn't connect with them. This realization hurt incredibly. But instead of making excuses, I made a choice. The choice to show up for my kids. To be present when I'm with them and make more quality time for them. I GET TO BE A FUN MOM! 
Thank you Kalani, this is a gift I can take with me forever and enrich my kids lives as well. Thank you to my fellow LV179 (and my awesome sauce small group) for taking a chance on me, pushing me to dig deeper, holding me accountable and allowing me to show I care. I'll share more of this journey, but for now... I'm committed to creating a thriving life! ...

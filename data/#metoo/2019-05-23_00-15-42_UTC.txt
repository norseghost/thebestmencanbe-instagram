Finished this brilliant, groundbreaking book today. I can’t believe I hadn’t read this one until now. .

Anderson has helped pave the way for powerful discussions about consent, trauma, rape, and speaking out. I look forward to discussing this one as well as Shout and some of her other phenomenal works with the @unabridgedpod crew next month. .
Have you read Laurie Halse Anderson? What did you think?

REVIEW: 3.5/5 stars

Whisper Network is a bad-ass feminist office/courtroom drama that beings a fierce voice to the #metoo movement. The chicks in this book have put their foot down and said enough is enough with the patriarchy taking over the office and taking what they think is theirs. OUT JULY 2019

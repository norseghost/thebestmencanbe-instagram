Month off hiking. Switched to writing to get off my leg. Leader in the modern farm to table movement - Chez Panisse. I don't think running across this beautiful cookbook was a coincidence. I don't believe anything is a coincidence. I believe it's connected to having culinary instruction workshop by the head chef of this lovely restaurant at the end of June!. I've been trying to make sure that one element of my culinary studies stays really out-of-the-box and super directly connected to my favorite elements of the food world- like California Cuisine's Pharm to Table. If my knee didn't get injured I wouldn't have started writing the book and attempting to get all these recipes digitized. Can't hike like I normally do because I'm still babying my knee.  Soon enough though I'll hike for a long time like I'm used to. By the way I did this working out in a Los Angeles gym.  I was never good at working out inside. I should keep it to outside especially on the sand! #craveadifferentkindofbuzz

This picture was taken in 2015 during Tony Robbin's signature event - Unleash the Power Within.  The one where you walk over burning coals.  Which we did. This event blew my mind and it was 100% because of Tony.  His energy.  His power.  His conviction.  His live coaching. His event.

Did it change my life?  Of course not.  Only I can do that.

Did it impact me?  Holy crap yes.

How do I feel about the recent allegations about Tony, sexual misconduct and what he has said about the #metoo movement?  Sad.

As someone who is in the business of personal development, people come to you with their stories, their pain and their weakness.  They trust you and sometimes look to you to "fix" them.  And this is why a coach, trainer or speaker can become seen as God-like.  Your guru.  And that is a very slippery slope of which many people in my industry have taken advantage of their students when they were most vulnerable.

I cannot speak to whether the allegations against Tony or true or not but I will say this: do not look to the powerful, the charismatic, the brilliant, the healers, the speakers, the authors as THE ANSWER for your healing work.  Their work might very well help you but not they nor their teachings will ‘save’ you.  You are not broken.  You might have some challenges and it is good to ask for help but never, ever, ever give your power to someone else. And if a mentor abuses their power or asks you to do something you know will not serve you, use your voice.

Was so won over by Emma Thompson in Late Night, I spontaneously burst into applause several times - like I was at a live play!! Screened as the closing film last night at the @insideoutfestival, she is a FORCE in this film that Mindy Kaling essentially wrote for her. Witty, clever and empathetic, it is a workplace comedy that unfolds somewhat like the Miranda/Andi relationship in The Devil Wears Prada (this one set in the writer's room at a late night show!) while delving into hot-button issues of #MeToo, feminism, inclusivity, and ageism! The hat-trick: manages to do all this while being consistently approachable, and never pedantic.

Are you finding that sexual harassment and gender discrimination are becoming increasingly muddled and confused?⠀
⠀
Both harassment and discrimination are unlawful under the Equality Act 2010 and both are rooted in an abuse of power of one person over another; but they are not one and the same.⠀
In the case of sexual harassment, the unwanted conduct is of a sexual nature and can range from overtly sexual jokes, inappropriate comments or “bants” to text messages, emails and social media activity, and physical contact such as touching or kissing – all of which can occur inside and outside the office.⠀
⠀
Discrimination is defined as unfair treatment.⠀
⠀
It involves treating another less favourably than others because of who they are – that is, in this blog’s case, because of their gender, but also relating to any protected characteristic defined by the Equality Act.⠀
⠀
Discrimination purposely puts a person at a disadvantage. It is a form of “othering” deep-rooted in prejudice, coupled with an assertion of power.⠀
⠀
Paying a female colleague less than her male counterpart, for example, is a form of gender discrimination.

This morning one of my lovely followers contacted me saying - ‘Help! I feel fat and I’m tempted to go back on a diet!’ and I said - HELL NO SISTER!! 🖐🏻😩And then I basically said everything I’ve written in this post. This inspired to write today’s #microblog and share it with you lot. Just in case you too are tempted to starve yourself to get into your bikini this summer🖕🏻👙 So thank you for the inspo @lisahew86 you’re a beaut! 🥰☺️

Project reflecting on a woman's wish to be seen and her simultaneous impulse to hide herself, after centuries of misogynistic programming. "For centuries, women have been reduced solely to their appearance, their physical beauty deemed their only worth. Western philosophers who have shaped our collective thinking - Aristotle, Socrates, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Darwin, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche - compared women to animals, incapable of rational thought, devoid of intelligence. And although present generations are desperately trying to escape these narrow confinements, the ingrained programming leaves many women struggling with their self-worth.

The objectification of the female body is an effective form of dehumanization. Women's sexuality is exploited and suppressed at the same time. Admired and reviled, chased and judged, praised and ridiculed, all at the same time. This oppresive societal schizophrenia is mirrored in every woman's soul.

This series reflects on the desire to be seen, coupled with the shame and instinctive need to hide." #marinkamasseus

Abstractions of trauma. 2017. What a difference emdr makes.

For 30 years I had no idea that my brain was operating at half capacity. I knew how I felt. I knew the emotional and physical symptoms I experienced. But deep down I believed that's just how I was. Broken. Defective.

I had no idea what I was capable of feeling and doing. When the headaches and nausea stopped. When I could sleep through the night. When I got my real brain back. I discovered I was actually a whole person deep down, in a place beyond the pain and scars. My true self was just incubating, hibernating and waiting for it to be safe to come out.

Now the place I was in that inspired this sketch is a distant foggy memory. Like a dream of being someone else. But it's still the truth and it's still my story. Even though now I know I'll never go back. .

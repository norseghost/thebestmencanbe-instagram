While in my hometown of New Orleans, I spoke via Skype with Dr. Yaba Blay. Dr. Yaba Blay is a New Orleans native, a distinguished homegirl, content creator, cultural worker, professor, producer and #ProfessionalBlackGirl. As a researcher and ethnographer, Dr. Blay uses personal and social narratives to disrupt fundamental assumptions about cultures and identities. As a cultural worker and producer, she uses images to inform consciousness, incite dialogue, and inspire others into action and transformation. The most recent season of her web series @professionalblackgirl focuses on Professional Black Girls in the city of New Orleans. Dr. Blay spoke about the evolution of Professional Black Girl; her recent tour to Historically Black Colleges and Universities with friend, colleague, and #metoo founder Tarana Burke; and Black culture, creation, and community in New Orleans. Stay tuned for the conversation in a future episode of The Matriarchitects!

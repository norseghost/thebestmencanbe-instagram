For your children.  For yourself.  For animals.  For Mother Earth.  For each other.  Advocate Without Fear.  Go AWF.  The time for silence is over.  What and/or who do you advocate for?  We want to hear your voice!

This climate neutral sweatshirt was manufactured using clean, renewable energy from wind turbines & solar power.
.
But thatâ€™s not all, the majority of the proceeds from his sweatshirt (73% to be exact, & up to 81% if we can swing it), will be donated to help others.  Part of the donations will help special needs animals (as promised in our mission statement), & the majority of the donations will go directly to help a Mother who is fiercely & fearlessly advocating for her son & his medical care.  At just 5 years old, he has undergone FOUR brain surgeries & is a modern day Superhero.  Because of his Motherâ€™s love, care, voice, & unstoppable persistence to fight for his wellbeing, heâ€™s still with us today.  Follow their story @iamcaterinalopez & stay tuned for updates. ðŸ–¤

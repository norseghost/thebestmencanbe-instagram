MENSTRUAL HYGIENE DAY is coming up on the 28th, and we want to take a moment to go back to our roots here at PERIOD. At its heart, PERIOD aims to serve, educate, and advocate to propel the menstrual movement. 
Through educational programs and by making period products accessible in places like public schools and shelters, we aim to make menstruation a normal part of daily conversation. We collaborate with service partners, brands, and an amazing network of youth activists to distribute products to menstruators in need‼️

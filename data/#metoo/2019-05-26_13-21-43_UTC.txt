When we say a vulnerable person should be less vulnerable, to me that’s like telling someone poor they need a vacation. Undoubtedly that would be great, but it’s ignoring certain realities. Vulnerability is also relative and can involve any number of factors - from a severe learning disability to moving to a city where you don’t know anyone. Either way, vulnerability is a perfectly ‘allowed’ part of existing and not a reason for anyone to abuse you. All of us have vulnerabilities, from common insecurities to a temporary stress we’re dealing with. You can’t iron them out like a wrinkle in a shirt - it’s just life. Most of us respect that. You wouldn’t make moves on someone who’s recently bereaved. You know they’re raw and in turmoil it’s not fair. You know that you, as the less vulnerable person in the scenario, have a responsibility. This should be our norm. That a person’s vulnerabilities bring out the best in us, not the worst. That as someone vulnerable, we deserve more respect, not less. When someone intentionally breaks this trust, this is the wrong, *not* the fact someone happened to be vulnerable in the first place. Imagine a mother with a stroller. She gets to some steps and is struggling. Some people walk by. Another might stop to help. But in what world would it be the mother’s fault if a passer-by sees it as an opportunity and steals her purse? That’s how society behaves regarding abuse. “You shouldn’t be so <insert normal human quality>.” “What did you expect?” This is saying it’s ok and normal for predators to own the field and we must hide and constrain ourselves or get picked off accordingly. It’s totally backwards. Predators aren’t even *that* many people. And, like a lot of bullies, they’re often cowards, which is why they go for vulnerabilities in the first place. We’ve got this, more than got this. If - instead of fearing and turning on vulnerability - we stand by our right to be vulnerable and stick together.

🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Happy Memorial Day🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Memorial Day is a federal holiday in the United States for remembering and honoring people who have died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. 
Memorial Day is considered the unofficial start of the summer vacation season in the United States,[3] while Labor Day marks its end on the first Monday of September.

Many people visit cemeteries and memorial picnics on Memorial Day, particularly to honor those who died in military service. Many volunteers place an American flag on each grave in national cemeteries. I grew up in a military family that always went to church on Sunday and prayed for our fallen then thank God for those whom returned to us. However, on Monday we BBB’D and partied with and for our returned soldiers here and abroad.

Today, I spend the day remembering while it rains and I work on ARN, shoots, emails, blogs and marketing materials for meeting this week. I’m thinking our people need soldiers everywhere and our communities are better because of them. 
Thank you for your service. Cheers 🥂

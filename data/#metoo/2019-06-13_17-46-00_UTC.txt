@mistytripoli just said this during the Body Groove 30 day challenge (I’m so behind 😬) and it hit me like a punch to the gut. It’s an idea that has always tickled at the edge of my brain for a long time but it was like, suddenly I “got it”. Disclaimer: Wasn’t sure if I should credit her with the quote or the the therapist Marisa Peer she mentioned but definitely wanted to make this graphic and share ♥️♥️

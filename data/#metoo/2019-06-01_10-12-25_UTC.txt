It’s a big day for me and my fellow little wings in @underwingband 🌀🤩 All the work put into this product, all the anxious studio sessions, all the discussions regarding sound, all the e-mails, all the personal trauma about overcoming addictions and coming back to the same lessons you thought you had learned - It all boils down to this! 🌀 
Tonight, I’m killing a part of myself to make room for something greater - and you all get to come hang with us at @bankgarendal! 
It’s also @ehtoori ’s birthday! This man is my best friend, and we’re gonna take over the fucking world together! 🤝❤️ See you soon! 🤩

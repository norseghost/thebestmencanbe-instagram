Kancel the Kardashians! 
If you are not outraged, you are not paying attention. The irony of white women glamourising a dystopian world of Biblical Dominionism that oppresses women, eradicated rights and treats women as property is laughable, if not truly sickening. This is not just fiction. Women in nations like Saudi Arabia actually live this heinous life everyday. The ignorance and lack of understanding of this political and religious narrative, now taking form as American policy to oppress women is on full display by Kylie Jenner. This is how authoritarian regimes and dictatorships rise and come to power. When rich white women are too busy taking selfies dressed up as hand maidens for parties....🤦🏽‍♀️ #politics #feminist #feminism #london #blogger #smashpatriarchy #justice #metoo #timesup

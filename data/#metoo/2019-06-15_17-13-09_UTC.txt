[Trigger warning]
.
The Whitewashed Wall.

My mind fails me
Dry hopelessness evident in my widened eyes
My limbs fail me
Frozen and unmoving
I fail myself 
As another takes control over me
Trailing trails of electric touches over my tender flesh
Because that’s all I am at the end of it
Meat to be used for another’s pleasure.
.
Empty words of insincere comfort are muttered “There now, be quiet, it’s alright”
As his hands explore
Taking advantage of my lack of response 
The smell of cigarettes is heavy on him 
As he leans, burying his face in the nook of my neck “Stop”, I croak
That only seems to encourage him
I see the wanton lust burning in his eyes
As I feel him against me.
.
“No.”
I manage to say louder
The words are of no consequence 
With a sudden forceful movement
I’m slammed against the rough whitewashed wall
All I see is the wall
But what I feel is so much more
Violated, for one
And pain, as it rips through my body
My hands rake at the whitewashed wall
Ny nails break and bleed
My labored breathing is loud
But his brutish, guttural moans of pleasure are louder
Each thrust sending an intense wave of pain through me.
.
I whimper against the whitewashed wall
My hands curl into fists
My nails biting into the skin of my palm
His grip on me is unyielding 
As his hand digs into my side
And holds my face against the whitewashed wall.
.
And then suddenly, it’s over
And I realised it was only him holding me up
For as he left
I crumpled to the ground
A dull ache between my legs
Curling up as the tears welled 
Staring at the smears of red on the whitewashed wall
Echoing the same word again and again
But only when it didn’t matter anymore.
The only refusal was the refusal of reality.
.
I live
But not truly
I live
But as an empty vessel
For that was the day I died
In front of the whitewashed wall. .

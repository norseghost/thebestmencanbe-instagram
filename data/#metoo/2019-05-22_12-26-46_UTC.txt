‚ÄúIts is more than just flashbacks...‚Äù if you suffer from PTSD, you would know what I mean. I would like dedicate this film to all those who‚Äôve been dealing with depression, anxiety, self-harm,etc... To all those who have been abandoned, abused and neglected. This is for you. 
It took me a long time to be at peace with myself. Don‚Äôt be fooled, I am still battling the same battle but I know now that I will never be alone. If you ever feel alone, I am here for you and WE CAN FACE OUR DEMONS TOGETHER. 
I would like to thank my parents @rissafesenining for being so supportive of my endeavors. Thank you for allowing me to use my God-given talents to help others. 
Thank u @liltonstewart3 for helping me turn this dream into a reality and for keeping me in check when I had to relive my trauma over and over again for the sake of the film. I truly appreciate you! ‚ù§Ô∏è

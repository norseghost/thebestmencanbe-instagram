(Well, to be fair, he is a former crack dealer so I guess he had something to offer crack addicts). So I moved on and most\u00a0\u00a0importantly, I forgave myself for having been naive and self-sabotaging enough to ever let such an individual anywhere near me.\u00a0 And for burdening my precious daughter with such a disgraceful biological father.\u00a0 That was a whole lot of forgiveness.\n.\n.\n.\nDid you forgive yourself?\n.\n.\n.\n#righteousanger\n#narcissisticabuse\u00a0\n#selfcompassion\n#selflove\n#boundaries\u00a0\n#overcomingabuse\u00a0#empaths #npdsurvivors #victornotvictim\u00a0#empathsofinstagram #peoplepleasing #codependentnomore #abusesurvivors #metoo\n#recovery #toxicpeople #socialpredators #overcomingabuse #deephealing #HSP #healingjourney #narcissisticabuserecoverycoach \n#perspective \u00a0#clusterB #personalitydisorders #NPD #narcissisticpersonalitydisorder #sociopathawareness #forgiveness #selfforgiveness"

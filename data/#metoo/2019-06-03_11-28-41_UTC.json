                        "text": "5 years ago yesterday, I moved from Portland to California. I barely made it here after a suicide attempt that landed me in the hospital. Depression + being raped by someone I thought I could trust + an abusive marriage to my \"best friend\" ending abruptly was the perfect storm. Luckily, I had people in my corner, despite feeling completely alone. (Thank you @chanelunleashed for flying to me the next day to make sure I was ok and staying with me until I was, and thank you @danielle__marie86 for picking me up from the train and always making sure I heard that I wasn't alone.)\n\ud83d\udc9c\nI didn't want to come here, to be perfectly honest. I felt like a failure. I loved the person I had grown into, I loved my surroundings... The trees, the rain, the music, the body positive queer community that made me feel so free to be myself. But my family and friends were in California and there was nothing left for me in Oregon. And as happy as I thought I was at the time, I really was so far from it. I had misplaced my power and given it away to the wrong people in hopes of being loved, and I suffered dearly for it.\n\ud83d\udc9c\nThe last few years have changed me so severely. A lot of healing, heartbreak and growth. Getting diagnosed with cancer... And beating it on my own, was something that made me so much stronger than I could have ever imagined. I will be 32 this year, and it is now, barely, that I've started to live for *me*, advocate for myself, and truly feel happy everyday.\n\ud83d\udc9c\nI'm not implying my life is anywhere near perfect, but I don't even recognize that girl from 5 years ago. She served her purpose, but I am so happy to be who I am today. And honestly, I'm so thankful for all the loss and experiences... They made me realize what I'm capable of enduring.\n\ud83d\udc9c\nHere's to the next five years being full of goodness and a whole lotta happy... I fucking earned it \ud83d\udcaf\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#life #change #suicide #depression #sad #abuse #happy #happiness #heart #hospital #love #relationship #friends #family #metoo #woman #latergram #queer #cancer #portland #oregon #music #grateful #instagay #california #alone #healing #marriage #divorce #mentalhealthawareness"

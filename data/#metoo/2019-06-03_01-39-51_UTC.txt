^AVAILABLE NOW^
We know you missed us last week, but no worries.
Quarter past four is back from our frightening mini vacation to some degree of losing our minds, dinosaurs making it out of the Jurassic park  island and reaching their final destination (Raptors make the NBA Finals).

Album reviews and a SIZZLING top five fire off.

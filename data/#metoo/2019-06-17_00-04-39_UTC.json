He sucked at a lot of things. But he was a great fucking father.\n...\nHe was honest with me, even when it hurt or made me so uncomfortable that I wanted to crawl into a cave for days and not emerge. He wanted me to have everything he didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t \u2014 to be armed and trained in both art + business so that I\u2018d have the skills and confidence to create whatever the fuck I want with my life.\n...\nIt\u2019s because of him that I am.\n...\nThe more years pass, the more weird it is to me that I\u2019m approaching a birthday that will mark half my life without my father.\n...\nBut on Father\u2019s Day, as I look back on my 20 years with my father \u2014 all I feel is gratitude for everything I got that SO many people don\u2019t.\n...\nI had a father who took the time and energy to go to the park and throw a ball around whenever the weather was beautiful, to take our family to arboretums, the beach, amusement parks (and lots of Disney World).\n...\nI had a father who would coach me through difficult situations, gave great advice, and taught me everything he knew about sales, psychology, sociology, marketing, money, and business.\n...\nI had a father who overcame a lot of demons, the best way he could, to try to be the best father he could be.\n...\nI miss him every day.\n...\nMy screenplay that\u2019s currently kicking around Hollywood is about a father and daughter who are wrangling with the challenges of gender dynamics and sexual politics in a post #metoo world.\n...\nA lot of people read it and think it\u2019s a little bit about them. About their relationship with their father. About the betrayals - large and small - that make them feel shame about where they come from. About the work it takes to try to forgive your parents for being, well, human.\n...\nThis is my gift to you this year, Dad. Thank you for being you and making me me."

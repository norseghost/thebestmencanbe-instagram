Had a go in this after EASY on Saturday. Much more raw than I anticipated and I  believe I may have felt the electronics assisting in keeping all in check. Phenomenal. In this car I'm an excellent driver. Just ask rain man. Did not even need rev match. Thanks Chris B!
These are good. Very very good. .

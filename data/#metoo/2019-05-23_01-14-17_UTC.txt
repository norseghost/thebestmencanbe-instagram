I’m excited/nervous to share the link to the podcast I did with @k_____king_____a with you guys!

I opened up about my ptsd which is something I never spoke up about until I moved to Ohio. Needless to say, it’s been rough, but I feel freed from my “solitary confinement.” Never did I think that I would be so open about it, but with the #metoo movement and the celebrities who have spoken up about it, its given me the encouragement to do so. Like @keyondooling who was on the @redtabletalk recently. An ex-NBA player who experienced the same abuse I did who ended up at a mental hospital because he kept that shit inside like I did (if you haven’t already watched it yet, I recommend you to).

Too many of us have experienced it and the cycle needs to end so hear me out, if you’ve experienced sexual, physical, and/or emotional abuse find a therapist to confide in...The sooner the better. I know it’s not something that we do in our community, but it’s the only way out of this toxic ass cycle that repeats in the Hispanic and Black communities.

That being said, thanks for having me @k_____king_____a ! What you do is super dope and I hope nothing, but success with X-posed! Link is in the bio :)

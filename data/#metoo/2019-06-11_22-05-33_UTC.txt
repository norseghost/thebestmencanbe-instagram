Day 1️⃣6️⃣ and 1️⃣7️⃣ - Once when I was little! 
Too much pain, too many memories of who I was when I was little. Just me, all alone, playing the world, getting bad habits like manipulative ones, learning how to trick others... When you don't have boundaries, you just came in who you want to. Difficult, maybe... Sad, perhaps... But you really get stronger! That I'm not concerned or regretted!

A huge thank you to everyone who called, texted, and messaged me today! I got written cards in the mail and even hand delivered, gift cards, and I even got one audio message from someone who sang Happy Birthday to me. 😊I got off work at noon. Got a massage. Had lunch with my bride and even got a birthday hug and kiss on the neck from a patient’s wife (long story) 🤷🏼‍♂️ #metoo. Finished the day with cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory. Thank you @bougieful! Damn good birthday by any measure. #happybirthday #45 #fasternotolder #metoo

Thank you everyone for all the love towards Gun In Your Pocket! This is a really special song to us, as it was written as a response to the #MeToo movement. It describes the unclear, grey area of sexual assault and consent that people often feel uncomfortable talking about. Thank you for letting us tell this story ðŸ–¤

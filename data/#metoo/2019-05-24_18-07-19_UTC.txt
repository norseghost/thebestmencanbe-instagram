This week I have been kind of high on the energies from last weeks #thecreativedoerretreat hosted by my dear friend @annaviolalovind 🌟
.
I went there thinking I would return home with some clarity on a creative project I have been struggling with. Packed my computer and intended to do some _hard_ work.
.
Instead we went deep into the creative process. Practiced the art of receiving and overflowing. Creating just for the sake of it with no focus on the end result. I didn’t get what my mind thought I needed, I got what I _actually_ needed 🙏🏼
.
We were given some quiet time in stunning nature (that was when I took this photo of @evamarianylander who kept us nourished in every possible way during our days together)and we also had some amazing conversations. On topics like how fearful it can be to share our true authentic selves and our work.
.
We as women have been taught to adjust and keep ourselves small for millennia. To not be too much. Not shine too bright. Generation after generation. We have been judged, shamed, even killed for being in our own power. No wonder it’s scary to speak our truth.
.
But it seems after #metoo everything is about to change. Sometimes I get chills and my eyes tear up from gratitude that I get to be alive at this time in history. To witness and be part of this revolution 🙏🏼♥️

Nästa systercirkel, 190603 kl 18-20, blir passande nog på temat ”Jag befriar min röst och står i min sanning”. Vi pratar kring våra upplevelser, gör en guidad meditation tillsammans, ser, hör och håller space för varandra. Kanske blir det också en liten nymåneritual på temat 🌙
.

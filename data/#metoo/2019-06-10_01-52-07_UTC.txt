it’s summer time which means bikinis which also means body image issues for a lot of us. society tells us that we have to have a flat stomach, big butt and boobs, no acne, stretch marks, scars, body hair etc and i just wanna say what BULLSHIT that is!! if you have a body— you have a bikini body. i’ve always been relatively petite but when i was younger i struggled a lot with an eating disorder and now that i’m older i’ve been having more body image issues. i think it’s important to remember that everyone has their own thing, their own insecurities, their own internal battles, and most of the time we don’t know about it. i know i’m guilty of comparing myself to models on instagram and wishing i looked like them, but that same person could absolutely hate their body. so don’t compare yourself!! to me, to anyone!! i think it’s funny when people tell me they want my body without knowing how much i’ve suffered because of it. so this summer, wear whatever you wanna wear, cover up, go nude, whatever makes YOU feel good and empowered!! ☀️

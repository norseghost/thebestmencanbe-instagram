Are you guys down to vent for just a hot second? Cool, we thought so.

There’s a lot of really forked-up stuff happening in the world these days, if you’ll excuse our language. And it makes us 🗣VERY MAD🗣 on a daily basis. The continued attack on our reproductive rights. The gender pay gap. #MeToo. That time they had to cancel an all-female space walk just because THEY DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE SUITS FOR WOMEN. 🤯

Because we believe in feeling your feelings (and because we had ranted at each other enough in the Book Babes group text), we put together a list of our favorite books for fueling your feminist rage, featuring favs like Rebecca Traister, @gemmalhartley, Rebecca Solnit, @professor_crunk and obviously, @therealmargaretatwood.

Check it out at the link in bio - then check out the list of organizations we included for you to support when you’re feeling rage-y and want to make a difference. ❤️ (PS: the book pictured here was a rec from our favorite Book Sis and feminist inspiration @dreamingofbecomingadumpling. It was terrifying and great, and included on this list.) #bookbabes #bookbabesclt #babeswhoread #bookshelf #bookish #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #whatimreading #bookrec #feministbooks #feministbookshelf #supportwomen

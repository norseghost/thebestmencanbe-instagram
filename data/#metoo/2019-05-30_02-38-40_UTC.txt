HELP MAKE STRANGULATION A FELONY AND STEP PARENTS PROTECTED UNDER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS IN EVERY STATE!

Our court system is so messed up. No one who pleads guilty in criminal court should be allowed to go into another court and say they didnâ€™t do it. She brings no one to criminal court because itâ€™s there she didnâ€™t stand a chance of getting away with what she did but in family court she brings an audience and tries to play the victim. Ultimately in family court that didnâ€™t work either. She tries to destroy my life and my husbandâ€™s relationship with his kids and accuses us of trying to steal her daughter. Ultimately itâ€™s she who has stolen my step daughter from us. Going on 532 days since weâ€™ve had a relationship with her. Now she wonâ€™t even speak to us or tell us why sheâ€™s left. Her mother and step fatherâ€™s hate for us has seeped into her. This is not love and is certainly not love of a child. Domestic Violence is more than an act of violence itâ€™s war within a family that never ends. -

Yesterday, I stood beside advocates and my colleagues in @pasenatedems in support of legislation that will address harassment in the workplace. #SB400 #HB1000 ————————————————
I stand with
✊ The farm worker suffering in silence out of fear of being reported to ICE. ✊ The store clerk who cannot complain because he needs the benefits to pay for his insulin. ✊ The single-mom waitress who doesn't report for fear of losing her job and her ability to feed her kids. ✊ The first year law firm associate who doesn't want to be blacklisted in an already competitive field. ✊ And with the Capitol staff who have no reporting mechanism to protect them from workplace harassment.

We must not tolerate workplace harassment here or anywhere. #TimesUpPA

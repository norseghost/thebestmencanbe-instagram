At twelve years old
She sits in the cold 
Engulfed by the dark 
Sitting on an old tree trunk 
By the edge of the silent river 
From far she can hear the ceremonial celebration
Drums beat with such elevation
The women sing in jovial spirits
The kids play and they all dance
Twenty fires burn brightly lighting the village in might

She sits in the cold
Her bare breasts scared
Her beaded necklace tightening
Her innocent fingers trembling
Her eyes dimming with every drum beat 
She knows she can't run far 
They will find her 
And he will marry her 
The dowry is already paid 
The bed is already made .

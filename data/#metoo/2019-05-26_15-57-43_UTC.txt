[History]
There is something incredible about history. And about HERstory.
.
Walking through Rome yesterday reminded me of how strong women are. How women birthed the men that are embodied in these statues. They raised the men who carved these. They are strong. Womxn are warriors.
.
While also wandering Rome yesterday we visited the Vatican. The same day the Pope made an announcement condemning abortion. I read the news deflated. 40,000
visitors per day walk through the Vatican just like we did. Thatâ€™s a lot of money per day paid to an institution, a business. While beautiful and incredible, I wonder about the mothers. The women who paid the price of this marvel of architecture. To that I say may we be celebrated. All womxn. And to trans and lgbtq. To all of us who are impacted by laws. May we stand together and hold our history of strength and speak out. .
.
For we created HERstory. And history.

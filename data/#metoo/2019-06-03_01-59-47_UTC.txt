WHISPER NETWORK 
Definition:  An informal chain of information passed privately between women.  It is typically a list of powerful people in an industry alleged as being sexual harassers or abusers.
.
In an article for the Verge published in February 2018, Sarah Jeong warned that "joining a whisper network comes with a catch: it invites participants in on the condition of silence. And because of that, we often miss that whisper networks are a double-edged sword: the same secrecy that protects victims and whistleblowers can shield perpetrators as well".
.
In this age of #metoo Baker has written a powerful story which begins with the sudden death of a law firm's CEO.  Secrets, lies, misogyny, power play and manipulation test friendships, professional behaviour and ethics as whispers become a roar.

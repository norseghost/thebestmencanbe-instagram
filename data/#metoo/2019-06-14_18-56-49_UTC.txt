NEW YORK FRONDS & FAM
I NEED you to call your reps! 
We gotta pass the #nysafetyagenda 
3 days left. 
Here’s why:

1. If we change the outdated (archaic really...) “severe or pervasive” standard for #harassment it will make it EASIER  for employees to hold their employers accountable for #sexualharassment in the workplace.

2. This could mandate all Non Disclosure Agreements to include SPECIFIC language that employees may still file a complaint with the state or local agency and or partake in government investigation. * I did not know this ☝🏽when I experienced this first hand while working in a quite FEW #nyc restaurants. 
3. All employers would have to post a sexual harassment poster designed and distributed by the State Division of Human Rights. 
It is a HUMAN RIGHT to NOT have to experience harassment of any kind at work!! And yet it happens all👏🏽 the 👏🏽time 👏🏽so let’s support this bill so that all the folks who missed the memo from the jump won’t miss the memo again nawmean?! It’s 2019 let’s get it together 🙏🏽 and break this toxic cycle.

4. ELIMINATE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR RAPE IN 2nd & 3rd Degree

NY state gives #survivors amongst the shortest amount of time to come forward and seek justice. This is shorter than every state except North Dakota. 
Let’s fix this. Call your reps. Let’s make it HARDER for predators to act violently Let’s make it EASIER for survivors to come forward and seek justice. 
Thanks Cuomo! Thanks Aravella Simotas! Thank You @senatorbiaggi!! Thank you @andreascousins for listening! @timesupnow

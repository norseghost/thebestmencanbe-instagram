How do we lose rights to our own bodies? We fight saying me too and then Alabama goes in and pushes the woman down again and make her succumb to oppression. 
I can't help but be afraid for our daughters, our teenagers, the female who have been raped, the one's who can barely support themselves and cannot support another life, the children who can't chose but go through withdrawls as a product of drug abuse, the parents who suffer mental health issues who can't care for children. I am not saying I am pro choice or pro life. I am saying you can't take away a woman's rights! .

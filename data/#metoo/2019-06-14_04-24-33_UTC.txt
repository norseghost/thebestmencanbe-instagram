First off, congrats on the Raptors for winning the Finals, I don’t think anybody really expected it. Second off Kawhi is the best fricking player in the league. I don’t care about Giannis, or LeBum, or even Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard is the best player in the league. He carried a bunch of average players, Siakam is good, Lowry is good, and everybody else is mainly role players, but with Leonard just makes everybody else so better, he makes the hard shots, passes up easy shots to pass to wide open teammates, and he is by far the hardest working player in maybe any sport if not basketball. •

#TheQueen is an expert at sending utterly-clear, but still utterly-deniable political messages, and I think her granddaughter-in-law may have picked up a few of her skills. While I know #TheDuchessOfCambridge has worn white on other occasions, she's never worn the colour to a #statebanquet-- until now, until the #TrumpStateVisit. The colour white is often associated with sufferagetes, and was famously worn in their honour by #NancyPelosi and other congresswomen for The State of the Union Address earlier this year (third and fourth pictures). While HRH has never openly voiced a political opinion, she has been known to make the occasional discrete nod towards feminist movements. For example, whilst royal convention banned her from wearing a black dress to support the #MeToo movement at the #baftas2018, HRH donned a deep green gown with a black sash and carried a black clutch as a nod to the movement (second picture). And although I may be wrong, I think that with a pretty white gown, she's done it again -- she's made a nod to the sufferagetes, and to all the American women looking to stop President Trump and his tyrannical misogyny. It's a discrete protest, worthy of a future Queen. #duchessofcambridge #britishroyalfamily #katemiddleton #donaldtrump #princewilliam #dukeofcambridge #meghanmarkle #duchessofsussex #dukeofsussex #presidenttrump #UnitedStates #uk #politics #feminism #princesscharlotte #princessdiana #duchessofcornwall #princewilliam #princeofwales #princegeorge #princelouis #archieharrison #suffragettes

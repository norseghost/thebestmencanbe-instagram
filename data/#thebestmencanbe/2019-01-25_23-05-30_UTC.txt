After multiple discussions with guys, we've unfortunately discovered that some are afraid to approach women because of the #metoo movement. Our Fourwrds flirty calling cards have been approved by a multitude of men and women. People are loving them as they create a safe opening to engage. Worse case the person is not available or not into your type, but they still love a good compliment. Make someone's day, give them the "I Think You're Cute" Card. .

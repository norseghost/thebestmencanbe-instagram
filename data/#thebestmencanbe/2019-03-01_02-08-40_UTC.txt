Come as YOU are! üëë‚Å£
‚Å£
These are some of the brothers of Sacred Sons and they are enlivening our collective of healthy masculinity by their courage, authenticity and commitment to becoming the best version of themselves. ‚Å£
‚Å£
We celebrate them for the work they're doing out in the world and for the love they share with their families, communities and this growing movement of rising men.‚Å£
‚Å£
Some of these brothers are in the Embodied Masculine Course II and they experienced the power of deep honest connections during our second Master call we had yesterday with over 30 men joining us from 3 continents around the world.‚Å£
‚Å£
Those who were able to make the call felt the power of vulnerability in the container and left feeling the fire of brotherhood burning brightly in the hearts. üî•‚Å£
‚Å£
We invite you to stoke the fire of brotherhood in your heart and the hearts of men around you because we can't do this alone. Join us as we gather April 12-14th for Convergence II where we will stoke the fire and be reborn anew in the embrace of spring. ‚Å£

Promo ends at MIDNIGHT! Save some money and celebrate the power of your embodied masculinity! Link/promo code in our featured story. üôå‚Å£

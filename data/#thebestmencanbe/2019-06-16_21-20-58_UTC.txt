As we head into #FathersDay I wanted to share a very important letter I have written to my younger self, and really to all young men out there. Let's strive to be the best we can -- in all areas of life. I believe in you. Tell me what lessons youâ€™d pass on to the next generation in the comments or write your own letter. #LetterstoBoys #TheBestMenCanBe #GillettePartner

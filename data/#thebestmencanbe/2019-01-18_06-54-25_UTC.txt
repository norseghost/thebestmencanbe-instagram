To all the boys who want to Boycott Gillette 🙅🏼‍♂️🙅🏽‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏿‍♂️ I think what you really mean to say is

I didn’t have any healthy male role models in my life, so rather than address issues constructively using open communication, I’m going to resort to bullying, violence and intimidation.

All my mates control their girlfriends and wives so that must mean it’s the right thing to do - so I can be seen as the “man of the house” and maintain my masculinity.

I’m lonely and would love to find a partner to share my life with so I’m going to go on Tinder and make vile, sexually aggressive and lewd statements about a woman’s anatomy and hope that it makes her beg for sex.

I’m entitled to sex because I’m a man.

Hear me right: NOT ALL MEN ARE BAD. I truly believe that men just want to be the best version of themselves. I have wonderful men in my life who are respectful and kind, such as my husband and my father. I have come across many many many other men in my family, church, career and community who are truly wonderful and they all fall into the majority.

But. There’s always a but. I’ve been a victim of domestic violence by a former boyfriend, I’ve been bullied and intimidated in the workplace by managers, senior execs and peers. Back in my younger years have been told every lie in the book and skillfully groomed to try and get me in bed. Virtually ever woman reading right now echoes #metoo and men right now are squirming because the truth hurts.

It’s about time a global brand decided to take a stand — despite the risk of making its primary target audience feel very uncomfortable. It’s about time a company addressed real social issues rather than use cliches in their advertising about what a “real man” should be [enter James Bond-like womaniser]. In this case, they show that a real man stands up for others, doesn’t resort to violence, doesn’t bully, belittle and berate women. A real man isn’t patronising and certainly doesn’t demand sex because he’s entitled to it.

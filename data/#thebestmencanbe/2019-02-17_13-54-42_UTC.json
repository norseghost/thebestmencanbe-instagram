They have a sword, but use it against the dragon, not the princess in the castle. They are safe to those God calls them to protect, dangerous to the flesh and the kingdom of darkness. They have more to do than restrain themselves; they live for the glory of God. They mount their horse, gird up their loins, and \u201cride out victoriously for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness\u201d (Psalm 45:4). And their General, instead of handing them plastic forks, \u201ctrains their hands for war, so that their arms can bend a bow of bronze\u201d (2 Samuel 22:35).\u2800\n\u2800\nThey are like Moses, not Pharaoh. They do not lord their power in hopes of cowardly self-preservation. They stand against an empire with the Lord over all empires, calling for tyrants to heed the God of heaven and earth. They are assertive and yet comprise the meekest men on the planet. They make unpopular decisions, meet regularly with their God, and constantly insist, \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d\u2800\n\u2800\nThey are like David, not Saul. They do not hide when duty calls. They gladly go into battle, when others will not, in the venture of their God\u2019s fame. They kill tens of thousands of sins, and fight the more fearful enemy than Goliath. They dress in armor too big for them: God\u2019s (Ephesians 6:13). They know much warfare and yet can testify that God\u2019s gentleness makes them great (2 Samuel 22:36). Battle-tested, yet they may give themselves to things such as poetry. And should they ever shirk their duty and do wickedly, they repent before God and trust in his mercy and steadfast love to restore them.\u2800\n\u2800\n#TheBestMenCanBe #GodlyMen #ThusSaithTheLord\n\u2800\nRead more at desiringGod.org.

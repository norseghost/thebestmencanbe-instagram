here’s me the year i came out. i desperately needed a hug, but i’d never let you know. if i could write a letter to this kid, i'd keep it short & simple: i'd tell him that what makes him feel weird is exactly what he's going to someday celebrate & be celebrated for. i'd tell him that being gay is normal, and that the way he navigates the world shouldn't be toned down for the comfort of others. i'd tell him that he only gets one life, and only one chance to live it up & live it loud. i'd tell him that there are so many ways to be a man, and that authenticity and kindness are integral parts of that. i wish i could go back in time 15 years to hug this dweeb & tell him how good it’s all gonna get.

i always hear the quote "be the person your middle school self would have needed" & it really hits home. how we all act is important, especially in a world where 'what it means to be a man' can so easily lean toxic. great men aren't afraid to be true to themselves & be connected to their emotions. great men are patient and kind and look out for those most marginalized. i wanted to get involved with @gillette's #LetterstoBoys campaign because every day, the next generation is watching & listening, and while you can't go back & tell yourself the lessons you really needed, you CAN act every day to teach those lessons to those who need them now. tell me what lessons you’d pass on to the next generation in the comments or write your own letter for #FathersDay!! #TheBestMenCanBe #GillettePartner

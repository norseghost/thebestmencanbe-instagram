There has been a lot of talk about “toxic masculinity” lately (especially with the @gillette commercial). Now no one loves a masculine man as much as me, but I think there is a difference of opinion in what being “masculine” means. So I thought I would share what I think makes a man masculine....
.
Masculine men are secure enough with themselves that they don’t need to bully those who are different.
.
They are confident enough in their strengths, both physically and mentally, that they are not intimidated by a woman’s strengths.... and they don’t need to tear down another person to make themselves look stronger.
.
Masculine men never force or pressure women into anything. They value and respect women... after all, they know if it wasn’t for a woman, they literally wouldn’t be here.
.
They offer to hold doors, carry heavy bags, and other gentlemanly things, not because the other person isn’t capable, but because they genuinely want to be helpful. .
Masculine men are driven and passionate about their goals. They do not become lazy when involved with a passionate person... they are motivated by the other person’s drive and never try to diminish them in the process.
.
They are strong enough to defend & protect themselves and their loved ones, but they know that physical violence is always a last resort.
.
Masculine men work hard to provide for their family... & do not start a family with someone until they are capable of being a provider.
.
Masculine men understand that being a role model for young people is important, and they don’t take that responsibility lightly.
.
Those are just a few of my thoughts. I realize that some may have a different opinion, & I’m always open to respectful comments.
.
...and if you’re reading this & thinking that a man like this doesn’t exist, then I think we found the real problem.

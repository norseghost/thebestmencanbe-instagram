Just weighing in on the new @gillette campaign, which is causing waves.... My razor was gunked up this morning, so I used my wife’s very pink one. Happy to. (Although I guess I’ll now have to buy her a new one, any colour).
As a boy I was bullied for not being that sporty and liking books a bit too much, and as a teen I was ridiculed for suggesting to my friends we didn’t talk about girls like they were pieces of meat. So I know where this campaign is coming from and think it’s brilliant whatever @thepiersmorgan and some right wing commentators might have to say. 
I’ve even had my masculinity questioned because I like chocolate, buy flowers for the house, love rosé and prefer a small beer to a full on pint. I’m proud though to do the cooking, baking sweet treats to varying success alongside my daughters and my son. It doesn’t make me any less of a man.
I like action films too, have been known to objectify and am useless at ironing, but that means I’m just me, not a stereotype.
Of course every campaign and ‘movement’ can go too far but let’s hope in 2019 we can all be our best.

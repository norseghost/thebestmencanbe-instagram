I’m completely stunned by the amount of men who refuse to self-reflect and see the harm caused by their toxic behaviors, play the victim even though they’re the aggressor, and make the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements all about themselves as they scoff at the plight of women. We have a lot of work to do to fix this culture, people.

                        "text": "There has been a lot of talk about \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d lately (especially with the @gillette commercial). Now no one loves a masculine man as much as me, but I think there is a difference of opinion in what being \u201cmasculine\u201d means. So I thought I would share what I think makes a man masculine....\n.\nMasculine men are secure enough with themselves that they don\u2019t need to bully those who are different.\n.\nThey are confident enough in their strengths, both physically and mentally, that they are not intimidated by a woman\u2019s strengths.... and they don\u2019t need to tear down another person to make themselves look stronger.\n.\nMasculine men never force or pressure women into anything. They value and respect women... after all, they know if it wasn\u2019t for a woman, they literally wouldn\u2019t be here.\n.\nThey offer to hold doors, carry heavy bags, and other gentlemanly things, not because the other person isn\u2019t capable, but because they genuinely want to be helpful. .\nMasculine men are driven and passionate about their goals. They do not become lazy when involved with a passionate person... they are motivated by the other person\u2019s drive and never try to diminish them in the process.\n.\nThey are strong enough to defend & protect themselves and their loved ones, but they know that physical violence is always a last resort.\n.\nMasculine men work hard to provide for their family... & do not start a family with someone until they are capable of being a provider.\n.\nMasculine men understand that being a role model for young people is important, and they don\u2019t take that responsibility lightly.\n.\nThose are just a few of my thoughts. I realize that some may have a different opinion, & I\u2019m always open to respectful comments.\n.\n...and if you\u2019re reading this & thinking that a man like this doesn\u2019t exist, then I think we found the real problem.\n.\n#charlottemckinneyxww #wolfandwhistle #charlottemckinney #playfulpromises #fullerbust #lingeriestyle #instalingerie #lingerielovers #lovingmyself #bodyjourney #bodypositivity #confidence #bodypositive #curvymodel #curvyandfit #selflove #selfworth #selfconfidence #selfrespect #thebestmencanbe #gillette #toxicmasculinity #masculinity"

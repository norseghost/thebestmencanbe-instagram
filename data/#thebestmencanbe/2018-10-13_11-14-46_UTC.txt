As @ikanyadike said during Our Future Men 2018

It's important that we pay attention to the mental and emotional wellbeing of our boys and men.

He doesn't need to align with the stereotype or narrative of "being a man". Because as a man he also feels pain, he gets depressed, he needs someone to talk to.

We need to create a society that allows the boys and men to acknowledge they need help and also can seek help.

‘To Be A Man’: a portrait series challenging the concept of toxic masculinity.
.
Alberto. Spain. "Its okay for me to disagree with the classic stereotype of what it means to be a "gentleman". Among the many, there is a very romanticised ideal of gentlemen and how they are meant to behave that exists and it is even imposed on men by some women. I am not saying I disagree with being polite and respectful but with how we are expected to conduct ourselves in certain situations. For example, the idea that men must earn more, be more responsible and hold higher positions to those of women,  is not correct. This behaviour also feeds into and creates gender inequality. Men face a lot of pressure to live up to these very specific ideologies and if we don’t we fall short."

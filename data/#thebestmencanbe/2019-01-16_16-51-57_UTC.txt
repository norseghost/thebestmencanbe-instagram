My little man got to "dress up" for school today. It's the 100th day of school so the theme was "dressing as if you were 100 years old." 👴👵 My costume attempt (with borrowed bow tie and suspenders) ended up looking more like a young Sheldon from Big Bang Theory or like a hipster groomsman... but he looks so cute! Haha 😍🤷🤣
.
After Coen was all dressed up, I took him to my mirror so he could look at himself. 😁 I love how he was looking at himself - both excited about dressing up and also proud of how big he's getting! It melted this Mami's heart! 😍💕
.
It also made me think about the kind of man I want him to grow up to be. Coming from a macho culture (where the man provides the $ and leads like a dictator, and the woman is barely above a servant in some cases - I'm exaggerating a little bit, but still!), I have always pushed and challenged the roles of men and women in society. 🤨 I really want to be part of the solution, and that includes raising both of my kiddos to be strong, brave, and respectful - regardless of their gender! 💪💕
.
Did you grow up in a macho-like culture too, or did you have strong and kind male role models? 👨
.
PS - I'm loving @gillette's new commercial! 🙌  Props to them for showing how men can be secure/strong AND respectful, it's not mutually exclusive! 💪💕 Being a Mami to both a girl and a boy, I know how important it is that BOTH men and women learn to be kind and strong! 🙌

As my second #FathersDay is approaching, I count my blessings every single day. Raising Leo is something I will never ever take for granted. It’s been super special to team up with @Gillette and @Fatherly to spread my words of wisdom not only to Leo, but to our new baby boy on the way. It’s only by being the best role model possible for the boys of today that they’ll grow into the best of men tomorrow. I hope they’ll follow my lead, extending kindness, love and respect to all those around them. That they’ll support each other through highs and lows. And that they’ll know dedication to a dream can take them anywhere. I’ll be cheering them on every step of the way. #LetterstoBoys, #TheBestMenCanBe, #GillettePartner Link in bio

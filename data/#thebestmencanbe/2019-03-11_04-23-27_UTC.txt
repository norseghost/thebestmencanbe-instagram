Nice try @gillette. Did you really think that by claiming to support our military and donating a little bit of money people would forget about your toxic masculinity ad? Using our troops to rebuild your public image is disgusting and extremely unoriginal. I will definitely not be using your products ever again. ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸

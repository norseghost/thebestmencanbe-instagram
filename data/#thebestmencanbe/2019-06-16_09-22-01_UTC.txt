My Father taught me the right attitude toward women. Im not saying mothers cant do that, but only a father will be able to show this through his example. @official_matthewmcconaughey said “Best thing you could possibly do as a father is make sure they see how you love their mother.” -
Showing your kids you love their mother means saying “sorry.” It means admitting you were wrong. It means saying “I love you.” It means doing all of this in front of your children. And thats the example that I saw from my father.

I’m so lucky to have a father that was so loving, kind, faithful and super supportive. I love you Pa! Happy Father’s Day! ♥️🙌🏼👌🏻 #happyfathersday #thebestmencanbe #dadvsinternet  #gillette

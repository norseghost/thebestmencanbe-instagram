This boy, you guys. ❤️✨ He made me a Mami almost S I X years ago. How is that possible?! 🤯 It feels like it wasn't long ago when he was just a little baby, and now he's a big boy needing me less and less every day. It's so bittersweet to see him grow up "so fast" 😅 - I want him to be brave and independent, but to still want me! Haha 😬🤷☺️

📷 Creative confession - when I love a photo but there's not enough white space on it, I use Snapseed to expand the photo before editing the colors and such! I took this photo really quick today after Coen picked that flower for me, but it was in landscape mode. I expanded the concrete vertically and then edited it in Lightroom. 😅

Gillette recently released a commercial, “Boys Will Be Boys,” addressing the #MeToo movement.⠀
📺⠀
It calls men to something better than misogyny, bullying, sexual harassment, and the objectifying of #women. It encourages men to use their strength and influence to protect the weak, to treat other human beings with dignity and value, and to hold one another accountable. It admits that not all men are bullies and misogynists, and it praises the virtuous acts of those doing the right things.⠀
🙌🏽⠀
Nevertheless, the ad has generated a conflicted response from the public. One popular critique doesn't sit well with me. (Link in profile.)⠀

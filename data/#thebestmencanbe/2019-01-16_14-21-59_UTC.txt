What are your thoughts about the @gillette ad campaign? Link in bio.

We think it's great that they have chosen to represent (the generality of) toxic masculinity and the role that men play in it, intentionally or unintentionally, and are calling for men, especially they're audience base to question the system. 
If they sell their product because of this then good for them. We can only hope that behind the scenes, @gillette reflects this campaign and its call for action.

Some days I wake up and am so tired of doing hard things. But just  like clockwork, I end up in a waiting room/line/coffee date with another weary traveler and it heals and energizes me. I leave better than when I came, full of life and hope. Then, I nap. So many hard things for one day. @nickliskey - can you pick up dinner? No need for me to be an overachiever . ðŸ˜‚ #introvertsunite #specialneedsparenting #ineedanap

Self-love didn’t come easy for me.
I thought I loved myself by loving others and putting them 1st before my needs. I didn’t realize how much of it I did. I found worth in helping others but I kept forgetting about myself. That lead to self-made resentment, which then leads to body pain.

For a moment everything in my life was out of alinement... latterly my body was holding so much of that pain that it manifested into losing 2 inches from my left leg with a severe case of sciatic pain.

It was time for a change, but how?
The 1st step was realizing I am codependent. Ouch, but yes, thanks to the book Codependent No More: How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself by Melody Beattie, I was able to start the beginning stages of self-love. I highly recommend reading her book.

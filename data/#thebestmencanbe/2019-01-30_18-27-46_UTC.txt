Anger:
You have been my best friend for a long time. You had my back when others picked at me, made fun of me, in a way you helped protect me for a long time.
👁
I used you only for defense but at some point, I started always reacting that way. If my ego was stepped on if I didn’t like something someone had to say to me, of me, about me I defend myself by using you. It became second nature and didn’t realize how much I used you on a daily basis.

Now that I have awareness I notice how you turned into my anxiety, that then leads to displaying you to my loved ones.
👁
I now see how you make it easy to hurt them. I was ignorant that my anger was and is the trauma my body holds within and was screaming for help.
👁
I now see how you no longer serve me in this way. So I free you from your duty.
I let go and free myself because I love myself. I lead from the heart and light. I bring peace to my life.

And so it is. 🙏🏽😑🧘🏻‍♂️😙💨

Bring peace to your anger by healing the trauma. By bringing awareness at the moment you start feeling the emotion. Take a moment to take a deep breath or as many as you need. Then let it go by redirecting that anger to a more useful happy memory or asking yourself ”What is this moment trying to teach me?” Sit in silence and listen to the answers.

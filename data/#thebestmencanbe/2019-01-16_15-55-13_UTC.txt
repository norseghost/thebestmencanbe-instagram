I LOVE when creative and thought-provoking marketing campaigns go viral, even if I don't agree with the message or product. It's just the marketing nerd in me! That said, it is exciting to see @gillette's #thebestmencanbe ad going viral because on a personal level its message resonates with me and professionally I respect the play on their longstanding slogan and image. Well-done for a company who has made millions on the concept of #masculinity to take this bold move and reimagine that concept with a modern view. üëè

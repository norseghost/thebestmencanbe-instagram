A Letter to my son @zaynwontlose on 2019 #FathersDay. Join @Gillette and @Fatherly and share your own #LettersToBoys encouraging the next generation of boys to be #TheBestMenCanBe
⠀
Watch me close because I have you in my actions.
Watch how I win and fall while staying humble to the journey.
You won’t always win!
But you never have to feel like you lost as long as you find the blessing and
lesson in every situation you’re faced with.
Adversity is inevitable but be your best consistently and stay enthusiastic with the process because the work will eventually speak for itself.
⠀
In reaching your best,
⠀
Dad

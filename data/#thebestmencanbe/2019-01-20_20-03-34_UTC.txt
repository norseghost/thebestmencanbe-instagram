Attention: Men of the internet. if you were offended by @gillette’s most recent ad then you probably needed to watch it.

They're calling men (not all of them) to be better.
They’re bringing awareness to an issue that many (but not all) men take part in each and every day.
They are speaking out on behalf of the many women (not all of them) that have been subjected to unfair treatment and sexual harassment at the hands of these (but not all) men.

The ad has called us ALL to be better, why? Because our world needs to be better. Our sons (and daughters) are watching and the example we set will influence both ours and their futures.

Our boys watch us and pick up on everything we do, (yes, regrettably some of the bad things too) but if no one is calling us to be better and keep us in check, then what are we doing? How do we become better?

I say again, if you were offended by the ad, you need to watch it again. As an involved father, who strives to be better, I could have looked at this as an attack, instead, I applaud Gillette for standing for this important cause and challenging us to wake up!

Yes, boys will be boys until they become men who have learned that this is the way it is. We can’t allow the cycle to repeat itself.

This was not a targetted ad calling out all men, it was in an effort to bring awareness to an ever-rising issue. I’ll say it one last time, if you were offended, the ad was for you.

End rant. #theunfitparent

If you're threatening to boycott Gillette, you may need to shave your legs, don a wig, dress, high heels, a push up bra, lace panties and a maxi pad with wings for a month. We'll spare you the tampons since I don't want to think about where they would go. BTW, did the UK ban the sexist high heels law yet???

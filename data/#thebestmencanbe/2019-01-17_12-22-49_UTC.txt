Google and watch the add. Kudos @gillette . Backlash makes no sense to me yet it does. We have an opportunity to write a new script now and teach our boys a new storyline. 📷 Repost: @girlpowersupply

Let me repeat, the only thing I’m embarrassed about from my post yesterday was how I ever bought that bag, but I need to call out some brothers.
.

I actually didn’t think twice about posting a pregnancy photo where I looked big “and different” and “not hot.” It never occurred to me the pic would do anything but prove that women (men and everyone in between) are capable of a great many things — of growing humans and human transformation. My intention was also to be lighthearted (all the celebs were posting gorgeous before and afters so I was taking the piss). What surprised me yesterday: .
.
.
1) all the comments, both private and public, expressing gratitude for the vulnerability of the post. This both shocked and moved me deeply.  They came from as many men as they did women and I’m so grateful I’ve somehow managed to cultivate a community here of kind people. A few women I know were inspired to share their pregnancy photos - heart in my throat. .

I get it. Posting “fat pics” — pregnant or not pregnant — is scary. Why? Keep reading. .

2) I was also told yesterday men were talking about me on a separate thread, that I had just jeopardized my image because somehow by posting “an ugly not hot photo” of myself I had shattered some illusion for them that they had about me. Hmmm...let’s digest that one for a second.

This is exactly why women feel such intense pressure to “be beautiful.” We are explicitly told we won’t be “loved” otherwise. We will be “unfollowed.” There are consequences, professionally and personally, when women fly in the face of male expectations. I’m acutely aware of this. THIS IS THE DOUBLE-BIND. .

I’m more than willing to pay the price to move the needle. A woman’s job on earth isn’t to cater to the imaginations of heterosexual men. You want strong women in your life yet you explicitly dehumanize us at the same time. This is exactly one place men can learn to stand up to other men. #thebestmencanbe

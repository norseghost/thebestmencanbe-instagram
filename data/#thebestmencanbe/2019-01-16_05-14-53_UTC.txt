Did you see @gillette's new #TheBestMenCanBe ad about challenging toxic masculinity? It mentions the #MeToo Movement, damaging messages, bullying, holding other men accountable and more. (You can watch the full video on Gillette's website.) What do you think?
Is this actually helpful? Or is it a brand trying to make money off of activism? Does it make a difference?

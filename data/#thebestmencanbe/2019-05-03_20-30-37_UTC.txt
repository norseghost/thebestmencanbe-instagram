A bit more from this their website:⠀
“The LIVERESPECT Curriculum promotes healthy, respectful manhood and healthy relationships; decreases language and actions that degrade women, girls and other marginalized groups; challenges harmful cultural and social norms; and decreases instances of dating violence, sexual assault, bullying and homophobia.  One of the most compelling data points that came from the curriculum pilot is around consent.  Pre-curriculum, only 19 percent of boys report knowing what consent means. Post-curriculum, that number increases to 75 percent.”⠀

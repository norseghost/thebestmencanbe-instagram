Swipe for the grand finale! 🤣 my basic takeaway is this... a razor company mainly marketed and made for men is just saying some of you are letting too much slide with the whole “boys will be boys” nonsense. Those of us that stand up for righteousness have an obligation to correct our friends/family/coworkers when necessary. Mentally project certain incidents happening to your wife/sister/daughter/mother and ask if you’d laugh it off still; if the answer is no, say something. Simple. Here’s some laughs surrounding the ridiculous reactions from people in regards to the new ad campaign hahaha #laughs #funny #memes #meme #fuckgillette #gillette #boycottgillette #respectwomen #thebestmencanbe #bethebestyou #realitycheck #meninism

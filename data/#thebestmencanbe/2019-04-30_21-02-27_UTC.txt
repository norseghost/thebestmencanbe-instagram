Can I share with you a personal story? 
My wife and I didn’t always find communicating the thrill that we do now. 🙋🏻‍♂️I was stuck in my own “schedule” of life of doing things myself and not sharing parts of my life with her. (Classic I can handle it myself mentality.) 🙇🏼‍♀️ She was craving more connection but couldn’t figure out how to crack my code and she had her own hesitations with being vulnerable too. .
For us- the difficult things we went through forced us to grow as individuals. Growth takes inner work and inner work helped us communicate.
.
We’re committed to the journey because communication can lead to respect, intimacy, healing and connection. .
So, together my wife and I created this tool called, “Questions to ask a man.” .
👉These are questions for you to ask your husband, brother, son or any other man in your life! 👊They will be archived in stories under KEYS.
Or 📝At Unlockmasculinity.com as a PDF download. .
↗️ Send this (or the stories) to someone you’re ready to have better communication with.

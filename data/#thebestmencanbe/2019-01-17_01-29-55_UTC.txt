This is our #GuysGroup post-evaluation form completed by an 8th grade student and group participant. 
___________________________

Most know that my day job consists of managing a #preventioneducation program where our dynamic educators meet with teens to talk about healthy relationships, consent and supporting victims of domestic and sexual violence. 
____________________________

Our award-winning Guys Group Program provides space for boys to discuss the #manbox and learn about sexual harassment and assault. Our groups are deliberately on the binary and structured so it‚Äôs a safe space for boys to process together the ways they‚Äôve been taught and socialized to think about masculinity, gender and sexuality. 
____________________________

We partner with schools and community organizations and ask that they identify boys who are leaders and who will influence change among their peers. 
____________________________

Right now we are hiring for two Guys Group Facilitators who can hold space with boys, build rapport, challenge them and hold them accountable to change that will ultimately eliminate violence against women, girls and gender-expansive folks. If you know someone in the St. Louis area (or knows someone who knows someone) who may be interested in applying for these positions, have them contact me for more information.

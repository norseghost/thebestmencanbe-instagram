.  Shaving company #Gillette has been bombarded with both praise and abuse after launching an advertising campaign promoting a new kind of positive masculinity.

Engaging with the #MeToomovement, the company’s new advertising campaign plays on its 30-year tagline “The best a man can get”, replacing it with “#Thebestmencanbe”. The advertisement features news clips of reporting on the #MeToo movement, as well as images showing sexism in films, in boardrooms, and of violence between boys, with a voice over saying: “Bullying, the MeToo movement against sexual harassment, toxic #masculinity, is this the best a man can get?” The film, called #WeBelieve: the Best Men Can Be, immediately went viral with more than 4m views on YouTube in 48 hours and generated both lavish praise and angry criticism. “This commercial isn’t anti-male. It’s pro-humanity,” wrote Bernice King, daughter of the late civil rights legend #MartinLutherKing. “And it demonstrates that character can step up to change conditions.” The Emmy-award winning actor and prominent #DonaldTrump supporter #JamesWoods meanwhile accused Gillette of “jumping on the ‘men are horrible’ campaign” and pledged to #boycott its products.

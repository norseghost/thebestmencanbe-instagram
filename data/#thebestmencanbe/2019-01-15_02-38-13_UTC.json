For sexually reproducing species, including humans, evolution has endowed males and females with universal mating preferences that map onto sex-specific recurring challenges faced by each sex during our evolutionary history.\n.\nFemale fiddler crabs and hens prefer males with extravagantly large claws and tails respectively. Ewes (female rams) will mate with the ram that wins the brutal intrasexual head-butting contest. They reward targeted aggression by granting sexual access. Needless to say, there are innumerable other examples of sexual selection that I might describe, but I suspect that you get the general gist. Are rams exhibiting toxic masculinity? Are female fiddler crabs succumbing to antiquated notions of masculinity as promulgated by the crab patriarchy?\n.\nLet\u2019s now apply the exact same evolutionary process (sexual selection) to humans. Evolutionary psychologists have documented universal patterns of mating preferences that are invariant across time and place. In no culture ever studied have women repeatedly preferred to mate with pear-shaped, low-status, tepid men possessing high-pitched, nasal voices. In no documented culture do women\u2019s sexual fantasies revolve around granting sexual access to unemployed, unambitious men who occupy the lowest stratum of the social hierarchy. Instead, women are attracted to \u201ctoxic masculine\u201d male phenotypes that correlate with testosterone, and they are desirous of men who are socially dominant, who are strategically risk-taking in their behaviors, and who exhibit patterns of behaviors that will allow them to ascend the social hierarchy and defend their positions from encroachers. Of course this does not imply that women are not attracted to intelligent, sensitive, kind, warm, and compassionate men. The ideal man is rugged and sensitive; masculine and caring; aggressive in some pursuits and gentle in others.\u201d #thebestmencanbe #gillette #metoo"

He is a risk-taker who wrestles alligators and subdues them on his six-pack abs, and yet is sensitive enough to be tamed by the love of a good woman. This archetype is universally found in romance novels read by women in Egypt, Japan, and Bolivia, precisely because it caters to women\u2019s universal evolved sexual fantasies. When engaging in sexual role-playing in the bedroom, few women ask that their male partners wear their Google C++ programmer uniform. They ask for the fireman suit to make its presence. James Bond, the epitome of \u201ctoxic masculinity,\u201d does not cry at Taylor Swift concerts. His archetype is desired by women and envied by men.",

If a man witnesses a woman being attacked on the street, should he intervene? Well, according to the bogus feminist notion of benevolent sexism, it might be best to look away.

For example, when a marriage breaks down, in general men find it more difficult and are more likely to commit suicide than women. In part this could be due to less teaching of boys that talking about your feelings with friends as well as partners can be a helpful and necessary thing. It may be that girls are biologically more likely to chat/talk about their feelings (I don\u2019t know the biology of this), but if this is true then surely it is even more important to teach young boys the importance of sharing feelings as it would come less naturally to them? This could then go on to help the epidemic of male suicide. \nAlso, teaching young boys to respect women and each other can only be a good thing, in the same way that teaching this to young girls is important. If it makes men less apparently \u2018attractive\u2019 to women, that is a small price to pay for a place where both genders are able to respect each other as equals. \nI do agree that as an advert Gillette missed the mark slightly however; unfortunately a balanced, in depth discussion about the positives and negatives doesn\u2019t quite have the same advertising power. \nSorry to jump in on your post.",

'I am naturally a volunteer. When I see organisations like WIL doing good, I want to be involved. It is a part of my life that I enjoy.'
Meet Fredrick: Our local Adult Literacy teacher.
Fredrick retired as a headteacher, and since then has been taking our weekly group session for Advanced Literacy.
Thank you Fredrick for your happy face and continued support.

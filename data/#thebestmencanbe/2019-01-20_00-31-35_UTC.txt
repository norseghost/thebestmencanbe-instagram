Most of my activism exludes mention of men, especially cishet white men, so this one is for you, bros. 
Over the course of my years involved with activism and issues of social justice, there is one topic that I have seen come up across the board: toxic masculinity.

Boys are conditioned to hate the vulnerable parts of themselves, and across time and space have been stereotyped as strong, aggressive, mean, ambitious, dominant, unfeeling, etc. Because of this:
•The rate of suicide is highest in middle age — white men in particular.
•In 2017, men died by suicide ×3.54 more often than women.
•White males accounted for 7 of 10 suicides in 2016.
(American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)

Men are also the main perpetrators of most crimes (bjs.gov), including rape, domestic violence, and shootings. Raising our boys to become men who suppress their emotions and feel like they must be dominant and strong leads to issues for EVERYONE. Because of this, I wholeheartedly believe that dismantling toxic masculinity is essential to create progress.

This is not to say that masculinity is toxic. If you love wrestling and are ambitious, that's amazing. But when we force these qualities onto boys that don't want these things, it leads to mental illness and violence.

If you are feeling pressured into a mold of masculinities that doesn't fit you, you are not alone. Do not believe them when they tell you you must be x. Have the strength it requires to be a better man. I believe in #TheBestMenCanBe #Gillette #toxicmasculinity

#10yearchallenge

I was living a life of unconscious behaviors. I just wanted to feel accepted and wanted.
‚Ä¢
A lot of emotional trauma and lack of self worth lead me to look for love in all the wrong relationships and down a glass of my favorite choice of cocktails or beers to hide it all and not deal with any of it. I was still me, funny, outgoing super social person but an extreme amplified version of myself.  This means that all my other suppressed emotions were amplified too by my lovely friend alcohol.

My sadness & fears lead to anger and I would cry myself to sleep several times when I was alone. My addiction to feel something meaningful in my life lead to my addictive behaviors to be my form of outlet that drove me to more unhealthy patterns.

10 years ago... I was lost and at the same time, I found my path back to the road I AM suppose to be on because next month on Feb 14, 2009, the universe brought @teri.inclan and me together and the path to healing begun. (Teri- thank you for never giving up on me. I love you.)

For several years after uniting with my partner I lived an unconscious life. It wasn't until I took full accountability for my wrongs that I could make things right. So grateful that it went the way it did.

Today, I am proud to be the man I have evolved too.  I still have a lot of work to do, but I AM aware of my weaknesses, I am making better decisions. I know that the answers to my fears are by looking within to the love and light I already lead with. To come to my breath and check myself before I wreck myself. Lol

A lot of healing that still needs to be dealt with but this time it's going to be different. This time I HAVE THE TOOLS I NEED to respond vs reacting to the challenges life has ahead of me. The next 10 years are gonna be f-in EPIC!

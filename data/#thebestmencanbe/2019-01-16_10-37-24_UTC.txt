Terry Crew's has been advocating for holding men accountable for a while now. I was in real shock hearing he too was molested and how other men laughed at him. This has been going on far too long. I truly hope this starts a whole new wave of real and raw issues of emotions, love and respect. When you understand the difference between masculinity and toxic-masculinity, you'll find yourself in better company, opportunities and blessings. You'll see you'll be real man of honor for yourself and for your family. Finally, marketing done right! @gillette Please make @kaepernick7, our modern MLKjr your ambassador, it will really piss off "real men"

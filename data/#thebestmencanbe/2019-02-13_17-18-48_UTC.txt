Today I saw #thebestmencanbe 💪🏼when I was talking the kids to school. It’s pouring rain so obviously tons of traffic exiting the freeway. 🚗🚙 I pulled up and saw a man pushing a car to the side of the road while the women was steering the car. I thought to myself “that sucks their car broke down in three rain!” But to my surprise I saw another truck behind the car unoccupied. Then I realized! The gentlemen had gotten out of his car in the rain to push the woman’s car to the side of the road. Not because men have to ‘save’ women or women can’t help themselves. But simply because he was a decent human being who saw a need and did something about it.

It made my heart happy as I pointed out to my son the impact that the situation had on me. I told him that when he gets older I want him to be like that.

Then I realized it starts with me. I am raising the future generation and if I want him to do that then I need to teach him how to do that. 🙏🏻 I pray that I raise my son to be the man tomorrow that guy was today.

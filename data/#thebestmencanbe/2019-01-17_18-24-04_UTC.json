                        "text": "I guess I\u2019ll sink my teeth into this one. Let\u2019s forget for a moment that Gillette has a long history of misogynistic marketing and promotes a pink tax on their feminine products. Let\u2019s instead invest the entirety of our focus on \u201cToxic Masculinity\u201d. What is Toxic Masculinity? To put it simply, it is described as the damage caused by the traditional expectations of manhood imposed on men. I guess I just don\u2019t understand the point of the video. It\u2019s conveying the message that men need to do better, as though our treatment of women has gotten worse in the past 70 years. My annoyance is not derived from the video itself, but by the praise it\u2019s garnered through its pointless narrative. \nWhile we\u2019re on the topic of \u201cToxic Masculinity\u201d, Gillette, I\u2019d like to call the women of America to the stand. You are physically abusive toward men, knowing it is unlikely that you will have legal consequence. You manipulate divorces and child custody disputes in your favor. You commit filicide. You commit feticide. You too sexually harass unwilling coworkers in the workplace. You too cheat on your partners. You too bring down fellow women for personal gain. You too are a walking, breathing mistake that the earth coughed up. We all are. Men and women alike are the scourge of this earth. So then, why are why targeting one another? Why are we blaming the group when we should be blaming the individual? After all, you merely exercise your maliciousness in sneakier ways than the more overt tactics that are used by men.\n\nMy point it this: Although I despise the term, toxic masculinity is a legitimate state of being in a mans mind. However, the issue I take on this subject is the ignorance with regards to it\u2019s feminine counterpart, toxic femininity. Where\u2019s that ad, Gillette?"

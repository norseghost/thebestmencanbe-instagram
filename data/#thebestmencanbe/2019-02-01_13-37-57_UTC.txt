ðŸ’– Link in bio ðŸ’– Gilletteâ€™s recent advert, We Believe: the Best Men Can Be, has been labelled controversial, patronising and, in some cases, a necessary step towards bringing men-specific issues into the mainstream. It immediately went viral, accumulating more than 4 million YouTube views in 48 hours and polarising opinion in the biggest divide since Brexit.

But with all the back and forth over whether or not the messaging was right, we aren't addressing the real issue with the advert. What we should be questioning is whether or not it was a brand's place to get involved in that conversation at all, and by that I mean their needless inclusion of #MeToo, which was included seemingly for no reason other than to gain a bit of traction and virality, as shaving has little to no consequence on sexual assault.

To make matters worse, Gillette actually has a pink tax on their products, which means their women's razors retail at about Â£3-4 more than the men's alternative. It's a bit rich coming from a brand who, in this advert, is essentially shaming their customers for not treating women correctly and it is that fact which, for me, discredited the entire campaign by stripping it of any authentic intent. In Gillette's defence, the advert did start a conversation about ethicsâ€”only it doesn't ask us if this is the best men can be, but if this is the best a brand can be. Iâ€™ve written a full article over on my LinkedIn on the subject; if anyone wants to read it you can find it via the link in my bio (which wonâ€™t stay there for too long)

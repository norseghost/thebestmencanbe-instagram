@gillette is taking on several important and difficult topics associated with “toxic masculinity.” The Procter & Gamble-owned razor brand revisited its 30-year-old tagline “The Best A Man Can Get” and modernizes the concept with a bit of purpose-driven marketing.
The spot shows men of different ages and ethnicities looking into a mirror as the sounds of various TV news reporters say “Bullying,” “The Me Too movement against sexual harassment,” “masculinity,” while the narrator poses the question “Is that the best a man can get?”
The commercial ends with a call to action, “It’s only by challenging ourselves to do more that we can get closer to our best. The campaign has got mixed reviews.

Unlock Masculinity #FollowFriday

#Repost @realchrispowell „Éª„Éª„Éª
Looking back over the last 20 years, I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes training my peeps. I always taught what I truly believed was best for them at the time...but the more I learn, the more I wish I could go back and do it all over again.
.
Over time however, my approach has shifted from just diet and exercise, to something that I believe is so much more powerful and long-lasting. This is what I have learned to date after helping people through the journey - of both weight loss (not lasting) and transformation (long lasting) - and I feel like I must share with you what I have found ‚Äòtransformation‚Äô to be:
.
1 - Transformation IS NOT weight loss, maintenance, muscle gain, or an increase in performance.
.
2 - Transformation IS a shift in mindset to living a life of personal integrity - keeping commitments to yourself. Your physical success then becomes a byproduct of your integrity mindset.
.
3 - There is no right or wrong, and there is no end. You are either moving forward toward transformation (keeping commitments) or backwards away from transformation (breaking commitments).
.
CALL TO ACTION:
If you are just starting the journey, just take on ONE commitment at a time. Master it, then take on another. If you break it, stay at the one commitment until you are confident you can keep it daily.

FOUNDATION FIVE üñêüèº
Here are our ‚ÄòFoundation Five‚Äô that we make all personal clients master - one at a time - before moving on with their fully structured transformation program:
1 - Drink an extra quart of water daily
2- Eat breakfast (or as soon as your feeding window opens)
3-Eat a source of protein at every meal
4-Reduce sugar to less than 50g
5-Deliberately move for 5 minutes every day
.
These are just suggestions. Feel free to come up with one(s) that resonate with you! And remember, the focus is on the commitment, NOT the diet and exercise!!
.
NEW YEARS WARNING: 
DO NOT take on too many commitments at once. Your integrity is at stake here. Just one at a time. Don‚Äôt worry...you‚Äôll get there. I promise

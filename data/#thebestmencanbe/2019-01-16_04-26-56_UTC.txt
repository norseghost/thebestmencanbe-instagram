Gillette’s Super Bowl spot is causing controversy for it’s take on toxic masculinity.

In the ad, Gillette turns its now-iconic slogan, The Best a Man Can Get, into a question: Is this the best that we, as men, can be? From “boys will be boys” to misogyny in the workplace, the answer is a “no,” but the message is hopeful, with the brand including a hashtag #TheBestMenCanBe. While some have applauded the brand, some have responded angrily—feeling the message is an attack on men everywhere, rather than a commentary on specific cultural truths and still others have said that the ad takes advantage of a complicated social issue.

Whether positive or negative, the spot is starting conversations. In a time where brands can’t afford to be silent in the political sphere, alienating a swathe of a consumer base is a gamble—but it’s a conscious bold stroke that can make a stance more than just talk.

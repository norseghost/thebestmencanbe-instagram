As we head into Father’s Day, @gillette and @fatherly are asking men to share letters of advice with the boys in their life in order to inspire the men of tomorrow to be their best selves. Writing my letter to my son, Jason, I hope my words can serve as a compass to guide him towards being the best version of himself every day, as well as everyone else out there – because we’re all in this together on this journey to finding our “best” selves #LetterstoBoys #TheBestMenCanBe #GillettePartner

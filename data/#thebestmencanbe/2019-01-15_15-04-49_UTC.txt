Gillette's latest ad expands their popular tagline "The Best a Man can get" to "The Best a Man can be". The controversial ad titled "We believe" tackles issues like bullying, toxic masculinity, sexual harassment and lends its voice to the #MeToo movement. It has gotten almost 3 million views on YouTube currently and many people against the movement have openly expressed plans to boycott the brand for not being a masculine brand and stating that the ad has a "feminist propaganda" starting hashtags like "boycott gillette" and "go woke go broke".
Gillette also launched TheBestMenCanBe.org and pledged $1million per year for 3 years to provide role models for men and the Building a Better Man Project.

Gillette President, Gary Coombe says "For us, the decision to publicly assert our beliefs while celebrating men who are doing things right was an easy choice that makes a difference." We commend Gillette for using their brand to speak on issues that affect all of us and hope more brands can use their influential voices positively. These conversations need to be had.

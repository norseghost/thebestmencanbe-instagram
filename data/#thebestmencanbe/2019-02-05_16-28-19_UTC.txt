Authenticity:
I didn’t know you but now I SEE you. Influenced by my surroundings, you got buried. Buried deep that I had to almost lose everything to find you.
•
I had to surrender for me to really see what it meant to have you navigate my life.
•
What treasures do you keep? What wisdom do you bring?
•
Once I owned my shit and asked for forgiveness to not only those I hurt without you but most importantly forgiving myself for not knowing you more, it became clear that happiness and love is what fortune you bring to my life now. You are navigating my relationship with my wife and we are healing. 💞
Authenticity, you are bringing me closer and allowing me to surrender more to my children. To allow myself to feel and really admit that I am not always right and don’t always know everything, why lie to myself, why lie to others when I CAN BE AUTHENTIC AF and admit when I’m wrong.
•
I admit it’s my fault and no one other for the energy I bring to myself and those I affect around me.
•
Authenticity thank you for awakening a part of me that I can use as a healthy tool, a sword to slay the egotistic demons I hold.
🙏🏽✨👁✨💛
And so it is.

I'm joining @Gillette and @Fatherly in celebrating my boys as much as they are celebrating me this coming #FathersDay. They've taught me how to be a lifelong learner through all of our everyday adventures. Below is a letter to them, and a small window into how grateful I am to have the best job of being their father. The men they will be tomorrow is, in small part, because of the example I set today. It’s a challenge and an honor I don’t take lightly.

Dear Boys,
We've done a lot of things together, but nowhere has there been more living, learning and growing than when I'm coaching you in Little League. I've watched you as a coach and as a dad in the stands, cheering your successes and bursting with pride when you stand up in the face of defeat and just keep swinging. I'm so proud to see how you've learned to carry over the lessons learned on the field into your life off the field. 
Because like baseball, no one moment in life is ever the same. The best that you can work towards is that you make the right choice at the right time. And if you get it wrong, that's okay. Success is measured by progress, not by any one catch, home run or winning game. I hope I’ve been able to show you that on the field, but also in the example I set for you at home. Because progress, not perfection, is how you achieve your dreams. 
Together, we’ve seen the listening without fear, learning without boundaries, and adjusting to whatever life brings will help you find the best version of yourselves. I'm so proud to see that you are learning that and learning that life is more about how you get there and less about the arrival itself. 
This Father's Day, I want to thank you for teaching me how to be a better man and a better father. Remember that no matter where I stand to watch you on the field or in life, I'm proud of you. 
Love, Dad

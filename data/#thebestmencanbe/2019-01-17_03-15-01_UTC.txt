How interesting is the new Gillette commercial?? How much more interesting is it that men are OFFENDED by it?

Instead of taking the message and making positive changes in your community or household from the ways that have traditionally been part of society and their idea of what a man is let’s negate it.

Instead of being butt hurt about an ad that may possibly portray a negative side of the world maybe try to be a part of the solution.

Maybe the reason that men are offended by this is because they may see themselves in parts of it. That’s why we tend to be offended by things usually right? We’ve ALL been in situations where we did the wrong thing or didn’t speak up for someone who needed us to or made the wrong choice.

But does ignoring it mean that it doesn’t happen? Does it mean that it’ll go away? I don’t think so, just ask the RCMP how that worked for them.

Women since the beginning of time have been attacked or targeted for their flaws and will continue to take shit for it til the end of time especially in the media and advertising. But why is it when a man’s feelings are hurt they go crazy over an ad that’s actually supporting healthy, strong and confident behaviours. Why is that wrong?

The beginning of the ad is showing negative behaviours but if you hold your horses for a second you’ll see where it shows that many men do the right things. It’s about stepping up and doing the right thing. It’s about changing a culture that excuses so many negative behaviours toward woman AND men because boys will be boys. It’s about teaching that we respect people and different doesn’t mean wrong. It’s about not using power to hurt or intimidate someone. It’s really a message to all people and if people can’t see how society could be better than you’re not seeing the big picture.

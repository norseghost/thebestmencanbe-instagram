I am so thankful for every opportunity I get like this. I approach each invitation with a sense of gratitude, service, and excitement. I love the collective connection of large events and the power of storytelling.

I’ll be sharing an African proverb that states: If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

In 2011 I set out to break the World Record for traversing Ireland on foot. The distance is about 605 km and back then the record was 5.5 days. I set out with 2 goals. Break the record and raise €20k for autism. The adventure started well and I was ahead of record pace beginning day 3. Then it all fell apart. I was faced with a decision that fundamentally changed how I look at individualism vs community. Instead of quitting when my body gave up, I jumped on my friend’s bike and rode the rest of the way. That simple act of not giving up garnered more momentum than I ever ever imagined and as the story went viral, others joined me and rode in solidarity. What l learned was this: When we want to do something for ourselves and our personal kingdom/brand, we’ll only go so far. But, when we are surrounded by kindred spirts and the mission is bigger than anyone individual, we’ll go further than we ever imagined. Our run may be reduced to a walk—or even a limp—but moving forward together brings far richer rewards than individual glory.

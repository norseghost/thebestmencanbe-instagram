A little over a year ago, @justinbaldoni , who is an actor, director, and filmmaker spoke at a @ted event.

Justin shares why he is done trying to be “man enough.” He dives down into all the things boys are taught and societal pressures we have in order to be seen as manly. He wants to us as men to stop pretending to be someone and use the strength and bravery we were given to explore our own hearts and be vulnerable.

We suggest that you listen to this @ted Talk as soon as possible and whether you are a man or a woman, please comment below on what you thought was the most impactful aspect of Justin’s speech.

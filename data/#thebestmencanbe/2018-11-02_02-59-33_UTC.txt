This portrait is my tribute to the courageous Anita Hill. Twenty seven years ago, Anita stood up for women. And we didn’t have her back. Anita, for this we are sorry.  I can’t help but think how lucky women are. Lucky it was just one guy. Lucky he groped you but didn’t penetrate. Lucky you were unconscious so you won’t remember. Lucky you had a witness. Lucky you weren’t injured. Lucky it has only happened once. Lucky you were young so you will forget. Lucky you have friends to walk you home. Lucky your boss marginalizes you but doesn’t fire you. Lucky for drink lids so you aren’t drugged. Lucky he didn’t kill you.  LUCKY. When did the bar for women sink so low?  This is an extraordinary time. A reckoning. Women and men of my age, who had not the tools nor the mentors to change things for the better, must be vocal now in their leadership. This MUST stop. Do what you can; speak, mentor, write, paint, vote, intervene, march, educate, donate, support. LOUDLY.

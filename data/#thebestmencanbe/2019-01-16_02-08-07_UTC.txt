@Gillette's new ads is campaigning that #TheBestMenCanBe is to fight #ToxicMasculinity.

This reminds me of my talk with my man @terrycrews at @oneyoungworld. We talked about how majority of Indonesian men view smoking as a very 'male' and 'masculine' thing to do.

Talking about toxic masculinity, smoking is literally a toxic behavior both for your body and for your mental health with its addictive nature.

There is no way we should tolerate toxic masculinity that harms both ourselves and other people. In Terry's words, it's only with vulnerability can we truly see who we really are and what our real strength is.

Have a problem? Talk about it. See a problem? Act against it. Don't resort to violence, silence, or toxic behaviors. Choose vulnerability, and that's #TheBestMenCanBe.

The boys of today are the men of tomorrow, and collectively it's all of our responsibility to make sure they see examples of #TheBestMenCanBe every day. Today we celebrate #FathersDay, so I’ve teamed up with @Gillette and @Fatherly, as they ask men to share letters of advice to boys in their life – past, present or future, because it’s on us to share what we’ve learned, and be a guide for the boys working towards the men they’re meant to be. Join me, and share your own words of wisdom in the comments or follow the link in my bio to read #LettersToBoys from other amazing men. #GillettePartner

#MarketingMonday - Gillette celebrates 18th birthdays

For years Gillette has been taking the 'drug dealer' approach to selling their razors. With data they purchased, they have birthday and gender information for a very large portion of the US. They have been using this data to send out free razors to young men on their 18th birthday to welcome them to manhood.

But here is where the real win is for Gillette, once the young man finds his razor is getting dull he is much more likely to go out and buy the replacement cartridges (which is where they really make the $$) rather than replace the entire razor. 
Gillette gives away a bit on an 18th birthday, to gain a whole lot more in the future.

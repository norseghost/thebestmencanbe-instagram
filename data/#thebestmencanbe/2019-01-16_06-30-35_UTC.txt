Have you seen the new ad by @gillette ? If so, what do you think? I think it's VERY good and believe us men/boys can still be men/boys but NOT at the expense of our own wellbeing or that of others. Traditional qualities associated with #masculinity are simply outdated or inappropriate in today's society (and there's a good argument for saying they haven't been appropriate for a long time now). It's in all our interests to change and be better ... #men #manhood #masculinity

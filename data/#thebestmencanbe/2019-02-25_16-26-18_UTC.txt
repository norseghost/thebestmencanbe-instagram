Some men like women. Some men like men. Some men like transwomen... It’s all fine. It’s all label anyways and #loveIslove, that’s what matters. 
Huge respect and proud of this true gentleman whom I spent the stage @theparktheatre for #MyDadsGapYear with a moment where I became comfortably confident no matter what I wear. His talents, smile, presence and soft-spoken words just made me so at ease aside from always handing me over the pink sheet for our scene. 😊

A person who have a heart and mind to learn what truly a trans* and other marginalised people, I have seen and felt that not only to the character of Dave but also to this man @iamadamlannon . #KobKunKa 😘. An actor, a man which I believe represent one of that #TheBestMenCanBe @gillette. 
Now, listening to a song by #MarcAlmond “What makes a man a man”. I/ We #ComeOutForTransEquality #ComeOutForLGBT @stonewalluk.....ARE YOU?

@gillette just released a fresh new campaign with the tag line #thebestmencanbe culled from the old tag #thebestamancanget ,  and it's caused quite an uproar. The campaign which sheds a light on the constant use of heteronomative constants like #boyswillbeboys as a means of promoting #toxicmasculinity & advises that men do better since, according to them
"The men of tomorrow watch what we do today. Itâ€™s time for us all to take action." While many have lauded the brand, others have sworn off it even going as far as destroying their #Gillette products. Why anyone would find this offensive or consider this a bad thing eludes us, but we'll like to know what you think. 
Is this Ad welcome & something that was needed to be said or are the protesters right to find this offensive?

not 100% BTS related... but toxic masculinity is something they really advocate against... I enjoy seeing how people are becoming more open about how crutial it is to get rid of toxic masculinity, it affects every person and can lead to serious consequences...
I'm not getting into much detail cuz I have limited time, but I wanted to address this since is something I also believe in. Any guys that follow me, being a man does not mean you have to pretend to be strong or harass women, it means you are a determined person ready to stand up for what they believe, protect who who they love, and advocate for justice.

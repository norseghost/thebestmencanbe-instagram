Being vulnerable is challenging - but I truly believe vulnerability and empathy can change this world. Talk about your inner demons, because you’d be surprised who’s also battling similar things; we’re more alike than we are different. Try to find a support system that you can rely on - because you’re not alone in this journey we call life. And never forget that you can overcome anything & you matter. You matter to me, to your loved ones, to this world and even the universe - you matter.

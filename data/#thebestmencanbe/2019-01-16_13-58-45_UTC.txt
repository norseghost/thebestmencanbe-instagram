The new @gillette ad gave me chills. I love that they focus on how children are watching and learning how to act, interact, and respond. The backlash is obnoxious and flat out terrifying. I'd expect a company putting out a call for treating people with respect and giving money to support the cause to be met with applause! Not threats of boycotts and violence. I've used Gillette razors for 15+ years and will proudly continue to do so. #thebestmencanbe #fuckboyswillbefuckboys

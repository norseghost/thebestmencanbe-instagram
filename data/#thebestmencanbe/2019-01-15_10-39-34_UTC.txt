Shaving supply giant @Gillette has sparked controversy with a new ad that challenges men to “shave their toxic masculinity”.
The ad, created by the brand’s ad agency @grey and called “We Believe”, responds to the #MeToo movement and urges men to hold themselves to a higher standard.
Featuring @terrycrews

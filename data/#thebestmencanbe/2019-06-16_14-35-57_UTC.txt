Dear son,
There is going to be a time where your imagination slows because of your experiences in life. But that doesn’t mean you have to stop dreaming and that dreams can come true if you fight hard enough for it. Reality becomes life only if you let it. If I can teach you one thing, it would be to have courage. Have the courage to believe in yourself and what you want your world to be. From what I have seen, you want the world to be a better place where one can dance, laugh and just smile. There is nothing wrong with that. Don’t ever let anyone get in the way of your happiness, not even me. There are always challenges to beat and if you keep going against those odds, you’ll learn that you’ll persevere most of the time. Make the choice, don’t hesitate and lead the way. You can’t depend on others to make decisions when everyone else is afraid. Decisions are critical but nothing without action. I’m sure you’ll make the right one cause your intentions are good and your spirit is love.
Dad is here for you always. Love, Bah Bah

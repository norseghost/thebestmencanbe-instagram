Good start Gillette with #thebestmencanbe…

We too care about toxic masculinity. But at Kairn we care about all things toxic. Toxic masculinity, femininity, plastic…

We hate the stereotypical portrayal of men and women as blokes and goddesses (remind you of any recent ads?)… like so many shaving and skincare brands do.

We hate gender binaries. Our entire range is for men and women.

And we hate single use plastic. Our entire range is plastic free.

So thanks for the conversation on masculinity. It’s welcome. Let’s open it up a little more…

For anyone buying a new razor today, take a look at our plastic free shave range of razors and oils. 
Be your best, and also what’s best for our environment.

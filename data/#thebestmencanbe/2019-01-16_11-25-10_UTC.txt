Here, have some free earned media @gillette, youâ€™ve... earned it. If yâ€™all havenâ€™t seen the Gilletteâ€™s new #thebestmencanbe Ad that shines a harsh light on shitty dude culture, check it out! Will it affect major societal change? Probably not. Are people going to go sign up to be a better man on their website? Unlikely. Is it still cool to see a brand take a definitive stance against mouth-breathing, prone-to-getting-offended menâ€™s rights activists? Super cool ðŸ˜Ž. Love ya work, Gillette.

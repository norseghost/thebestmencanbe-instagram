                        "text": "Unlock Masculinity #FollowFriday\n\n#Repost @realchrispowell \u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\nLooking back over the last 20 years, I\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes training my peeps. I always taught what I truly believed was best for them at the time...but the more I learn, the more I wish I could go back and do it all over again.\n.\nOver time however, my approach has shifted from just diet and exercise, to something that I believe is so much more powerful and long-lasting. This is what I have learned to date after helping people through the journey - of both weight loss (not lasting) and transformation (long lasting) - and I feel like I must share with you what I have found \u2018transformation\u2019 to be:\n.\n1 - Transformation IS NOT weight loss, maintenance, muscle gain, or an increase in performance.\n.\n2 - Transformation IS a shift in mindset to living a life of personal integrity - keeping commitments to yourself. Your physical success then becomes a byproduct of your integrity mindset.\n.\n3 - There is no right or wrong, and there is no end. You are either moving forward toward transformation (keeping commitments) or backwards away from transformation (breaking commitments).\n.\nCALL TO ACTION:\nIf you are just starting the journey, just take on ONE commitment at a time. Master it, then take on another. If you break it, stay at the one commitment until you are confident you can keep it daily.\n.\nFOUNDATION FIVE \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffc\nHere are our \u2018Foundation Five\u2019 that we make all personal clients master - one at a time - before moving on with their fully structured transformation program:\n1 - Drink an extra quart of water daily\n2- Eat breakfast (or as soon as your feeding window opens)\n3-Eat a source of protein at every meal\n4-Reduce sugar to less than 50g\n5-Deliberately move for 5 minutes every day\n.\nThese are just suggestions. Feel free to come up with one(s) that resonate with you! And remember, the focus is on the commitment, NOT the diet and exercise!!\n.\nNEW YEARS WARNING: \nDO NOT take on too many commitments at once. Your integrity is at stake here. Just one at a time. Don\u2019t worry...you\u2019ll get there. I promise"

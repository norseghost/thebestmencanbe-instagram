At Green Dot, we talk about being an active bystander and promoting positive culture change through proactive green dots. A perfect example of what this looks like can be found in the recent @gillette ad which calls on men to be better. It is an invitation to men to not only respect boundaries and consent, but to act when they see other men committing an act of power-based personal violence. #TuesdayTopic #ActiveBystander #ProactiveGreenDot #SupportSurvivors #EndRapeCulture  #TheBestMenCanBe #Gillette https://buff.ly/2ssXS8I

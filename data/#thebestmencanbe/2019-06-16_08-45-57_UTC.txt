always an MVP! Even though I didn't grow up with a dad, I still have a mom who stands as a mother and a father to me. And with that, she is the real COACH!!! I love how @gillette stans fathers and of course single mothers every Father's day! Thanks for making me part of Gillette MVP! #GillettePH #THEBESTMENCANBE #dadvsinternet

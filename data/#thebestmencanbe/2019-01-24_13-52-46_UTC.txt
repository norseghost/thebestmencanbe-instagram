@gillette is under scrutiny for their new #thebestmencanbe campaign targeting toxic masculinity and encouraging men to part-take in changing the narrative. 🙋🏽‍♂️

“It featured men stopping bullying. It showed them stepping in when other men were catcalling women. It addressed the #MeToo movement—not by dancing around it with euphemisms, but with plain words: ‘sexual harassment.’ It reminded us that young boys are looking up to grown men to model good and moral behavior. The message was clear: Being “a man” didn’t equate to being a bully or a harasser. It meant rejecting the age-old saying of, ‘Boys will be boys.’ Being a man meant standing up for what’s right. 👏🏽

I don’t believe the commercial is hating all men. It’s not saying all men are toxic. It’s simply encouraging all men to call out and check this type of behavior if they see it. It’s asking men to be champions for their mothers, partners, daughters—and their fathers, brothers, and male friends. But to be honest, I’m not surprised at the polarized response. The fact that so many men feel offended by such a seemingly simple notion speaks to how far-reaching and ingrained toxic masculinity is. It speaks to how essential reflection and growth are to every man”— @virenshinde_ ✊🏽

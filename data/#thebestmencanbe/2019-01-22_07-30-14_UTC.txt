You've showed me what true strength, determination and courage can get you in life.  You've showed me what resilience can bring you.  You've showed me that being a man is about being respectful, thoughtful and taking responsibility for ones own actions. 
You're a father,brother,best friend and mentor to me. We've been through the best and worst of each other's lives and it's only strengthened what's there between us.

I think the only thing you haven't being able to show me is how to put gel in my hair and it shows for both of us! 
Happy 50th Dad,love you

Consumers consider more than quality goods and services when choosing a brand. Many are prioritizing corporate social responsibility (CSR), and holding corporations accountable for effecting social change with their business beliefs, practices and profits. In fact, some will even turn their back on their favorite companies if they believe they're not taking a stand for societal and environmental issues. - Business News Daily

Although controversial, I applaud @gillette for using their brand to make an impact. #respect

How much more interesting is it that men are OFFENDED by it?\n.\n.\n.\n.\nInstead of taking the message and making positive changes in your community or household from the ways that have traditionally been part of society and their idea of what a man is let\u2019s negate it.\n\nInstead of being butt hurt about an ad that may possibly portray a negative side of the world maybe try to be a part of the solution.\n\nMaybe the reason that men are offended by this is because they may see themselves in parts of it. That\u2019s why we tend to be offended by things usually right? We\u2019ve ALL been in situations where we did the wrong thing or didn\u2019t speak up for someone who needed us to or made the wrong choice.\n\nBut does ignoring it mean that it doesn\u2019t happen? Does it mean that it\u2019ll go away? I don\u2019t think so, just ask the RCMP how that worked for them.\n\nWomen since the beginning of time have been attacked or targeted for their flaws and will continue to take shit for it til the end of time especially in the media and advertising. But why is it when a man\u2019s feelings are hurt they go crazy over an ad that\u2019s actually supporting healthy, strong and confident behaviours. Why is that wrong?\n\nThe beginning of the ad is showing negative behaviours but if you hold your horses for a second you\u2019ll see where it shows that many men do the right things. It\u2019s about stepping up and doing the right thing. It\u2019s about changing a culture that excuses so many negative behaviours toward woman AND men because boys will be boys. It\u2019s about teaching that we respect people and different doesn\u2019t mean wrong. It\u2019s about not using power to hurt or intimidate someone. It\u2019s really a message to all people and if people can\u2019t see how society could be better than you\u2019re not seeing the big picture.\n.\n...continued in comments"

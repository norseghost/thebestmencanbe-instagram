'I like learning and getting to have new experiences. I like working in an area with diverse people and learning about our own culture.'⠀
⠀
Meet Joseph, one of two male staff members helping us in our mission towards gender equality.⠀
Joseph was brought up by his single mum who has always and continues to be his greatest source of inspiration. He says it is his relationship with her that drew him to working for women's empowerment and keeps him motivated to this day.⠀
⠀
Joseph loves sports and nature and in his spare time coaches teenagers in playing volleyball!⠀
⠀
We think it is so important for men to take an active role in work for gender equality, and are so glad to have Joseph as an integral part of our team. What do you think?⠀
⠀
Stay tuned for updates on Joseph in the field during the week as he runs his first #TeenVoices sessions!⠀

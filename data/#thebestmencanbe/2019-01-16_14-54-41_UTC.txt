What do you think? I personally love this! It’s about time that men start #standingup instead of just #standingby.

Cue the controversy! Believe it or not this ad is stirring controversy. There’s a #BoycottGillette hashtag making rounds. Some complained that this Gillette ad is part of the “pussification of America,” and that the company is “hell bent on destroying males.”😳 Piers Morgan tweeted Gillette is “eager to fuel the current global assault on masculinity.”🤦‍♀️ I say #SupportGillette!! This is the future. Men holding men accountable. Teaching the young. Setting great examples.

Our Project Head @c.ogueri and @ojoboagbo were hosted by Danny Sucre on The iDealMan Connect @nigeriainfofmabuja where they talked about Male Sexual Abuse.

It is important to note that:
1. Sexual Abuse happens to men and boys too; in the house, schools,  workplace, religious places, military etc.
2. The social stereotype we have placed on masculinity holds men and boys from speaking out.
3. The effects of sexual abuse doesn't respect the gender of the victim.
4. When guys say they have experienced some form of abuse, you should listen and try to refer them to the right help.
5. Being a victim of Sexual Abuse does not make you weak or less of a man.
6. Perpetrators can be of any gender.
7. If you have experienced sexual abuse as a man or boy , there is hope and help for you.

5 Men called in during the conversation to share their personal experiences of being victims of sexual abuse.

Does it happen to men and boys? 
YES

If you have a personal experience or would like to help men who were sexually abused, please send us a message or mail to theidealmaninitiative@Gmail.com.

Kids are not stupid! They soak in the #culture through all their #senses and #replicate to #fit in. Not fitting is hard, lonely and challenging. Make it easy for them to fit in as #sensitive #human beings and support a culture where #toxic #masculinity is eradicated. I don’t want to see sculptures of only men on Traffalgar’s square plinths. I want to be able to take children there coming to discover #history through #urban #sketching #tours and I don’t want to be asking them - why are there no women on elevated pieces of stone in this most visible and famous public #space. Men need to hold other men accountable. #intersectional #feminism #Repost @gillette with @make_repost

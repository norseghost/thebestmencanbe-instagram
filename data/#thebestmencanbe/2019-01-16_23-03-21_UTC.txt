#NYC · Excited and proud to continue my partnership with @Gillette this year and not only because of their innovations from a product standpoint but from an ethics + values point of view. #Gillette recently announced they are donating $1MM per year for the next three years to non-profit organizations executing programs that are aimed to help men BE, DO and INSPIRE better in order to achieve their personal best.

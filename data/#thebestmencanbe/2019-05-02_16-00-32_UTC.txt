Hey men out there, what do you do with your feelings?
1. Stuff it 
2. Hide it
3. Deny it
4. Any others? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? .
👉As guys it’s important to validate our feelings and know it’s okay to even have them. “I’m felling pretty upset.” 👉To understand and define what is going on within us. “I think it’s sadness under my anger.” 👉To be able to communicate in an effective and healthy way. “I need to talk.”

For your son, try this out: 
It’s okay to feel upset, I want you to take a deep breaths and tell me what’s going on inside. 
For a husband try:
Can you put language around how that upsets you?
For a friend ask: 
That sounds intense, tell me more? 
Simple awareness in our effort to communicate will not only help us, but those around us to: 
1. Validate 
2. Define 
3. Communicate

When we share our weaknesses and open to vulnerability, we get what we actually want- true connection.

How about you? What helps you better communicate what’s going on below the surface?

Over the years, we have presented a dysfunctional image of men who always want to be in control. Men who are irresponsible etc.

This presentation of men have been learnt and adopted by the new generation of men.

As a society, we can do better than this.

If we want a better behaviour, then we need better information. #thebestmencanbe

The best men can be police officers who advocate for more empathy in traumatic situations.||“Studies have shown that although the initial sexual assault itself is traumatic, usually it's the aftermath that is more traumatic for victims. If the victim is blamed, if the victim is not believed, those are probably two of the biggest causes of post-traumatic stress associated with the criminal sexual assault.” - Todd #TheBestMenCanBe||“I have sat in a courtroom where the defendant admitted to raping his victim and was still found not guilty. After listening to the defense play into the myths of sexual abuse to the jury that acquitted him, I realized that it’s so much harder for a woman to find justice.”||“I have a lot of scars from seeing the effects of sexual crimes on women so I want to do my part to make things better for women. One way I know I can have an impact is to be a good role model for my grandson.”||“Right now he’s too young to sit down and talk about consent with him. I can't sit down and talk about gender roles. But what I can do is I can treat my wife with the utmost respect. I can treat my daughter, his mother, with the utmost respect. I can establish that behavior as the norm so whenever he witnesses or engages in disrespectful behavior towards women it will become uncomfortable for him and he’ll either speak up or cease that behavior.”||Todds’ actions demonstrate #TheBestMenCanBe. We are inspired by his advocacy for victims of sexual assault, and in his name we will be making a donation to an organization dedicated to providing support for children and families who may have been impacted by child abuse. We’re committed to helping men drive change that matters. Join us at TheBestMenCanBe.org #LinkinBio

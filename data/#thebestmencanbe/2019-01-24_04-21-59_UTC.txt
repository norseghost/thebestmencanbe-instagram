*link in bio* Gillette recently posted a short film entitled We Believe: The Best Men Can Be in order to call attention to harmful effects traditional masculinity can have on both men and women and to encourage men to speak up when they notice someone engaging in harmful behaviors such as harassing women or excusing overly physical behavior between boys as “boys will be boys.” Apparently a subset of men found this 2 minute video espousing the importance of challenging potentially harmful behaviors threatening to their masculinity and took to the internet. Pictured above are two of my favorite responses to comments such as those from Piers Morgan stating that Gillette wants men to “take one of their razors and cut off their testicles” and that the video was a “pathetic global assault on masculinity.” Also, it seems to me like the angry backlash from men who feel like they are personally being attacked by a commercial that is encouraging respect and accountability is evidence of why we need more videos like this one... Check out the full article I wrote on this (link in bio) with comments from both sides.

@gillette taking a stand in the #metoomovement with their campaign #thebestmencanbe and we have to say well done. Nothing like delivering purpose in your advertising and getting well deserved hype. People need to be owning their truth and not holding back their thoughts because of fear. We all could use a little feedback sometimes on how we're doing things or treating others.  Back in the dating world, feel free to get yourself some date cards and start handing them out, they are PC especially if you find yourself on dating apps.

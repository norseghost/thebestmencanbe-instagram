Reading the comments on this new ad from @gillette is interesting. Good reminder for life: if you feel uncomfortable when you are challenged and feel the need to double-down on your stubbornness, explore that. Change is a sign of strength, not weakness. If the idea of sticking up for women or children or people of color or anyone different from you is making you boycott and dig your heels in the ground, it may be time for a bit of self-reflection. Change is strength. Maintaining stubborn old patterns of behavior and thinking when you KNOW they are harmful is weakness. Stubbornness is not from God but empathy and kindness are.

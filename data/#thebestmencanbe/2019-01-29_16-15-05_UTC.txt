Did you guys see that new Gillette commercial?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I think the backlash is pretty comical given that the message is pretty innocuous.  It's important in marketing to make sure that your advertising is compelling.  It should stand out and be noticed.  The Gillette ad certainly does that.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
And while I agree with the overall statement that men should be better and the ones doing good things should do more, as a marketer I'm not sure that I think it's a good ad overall.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Where I struggle is how does that message tie back to the product and the brand?  As a black woman, I'm clearly not the consumer target.  However, I haven't known Gillette to be a socially-conscious brand.  Most advertising I've seen has focused on the efficacy of the product.  To me, that makes this new campaign seem a bit disingenuous.  It also makes me question if the target of this campaign is their male user, or if they were just looking for a way to bring Gillette into this broader #metoo conversation.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Do you use socially-conscious messaging in your businesses' advertising?  Has that worked well for you? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Hello! My new #volg and #blog is out with many #reflective #conversations on the recent #diversity #fauxpas and then some #shoutouts too ðŸ”— link ðŸ‘† in Bio shortly 
Discussions on the recent #blackface
#controversy 
Next, most noteworthy I believe is definitely Gillette's, #TheBestMenCanBe #campaign and the backlash it received on account of calling out on #toxicmasculinity

Next,  Why is #SexualHarassment #Policy not #GenderNeutral

Because of #MeToo a lot of chatter is around framing sexual harassment #policies focused only on women. However, I have been relentlessly working on a more inclusive agenda i.e. framing policies for sure, but also ensuring they are gender-neutral.

Biases Oh Biases! And Ass Boss!

I will also talk about #biases in the #workplace. How to deal with them. The need also stems from my own personal experiences as I have come across many hiring managers, leaders and decision-makers to have #narcissistic personalities and an inflated sense of self. Heck, I haveÂ even worked with a few in the recent past! It's not just difficult to work with this type but also detrimental to one's mental health, well-being, and self-esteem. Sometimes a tight slap (figuratively) and a walk-out is just sufficient! No matter what's the prevailing job climate, do not let such egomaniacs disintegrate your dignity.

Oracle's Sad Scene

#Oracle was recently accused of underpaying #Women , #Black and #Asian employees. Such disclosures are very likely trending in 2019. The classic invalidation of pinning #paygap to market forces isn't going to work now.

The #lens of #Exclusion in the Bias Movie!

My own personal experience in dealing with errant companies. I have faced #exclusion challengesÂ not just as a #DiversityRecruiter but also as a candidate. I've been in the starring role in the bias movie myself. Believe me, it's frustrating to be perpetually "ignored" almost to a point of feeling invisible despite being the #protagonist :)

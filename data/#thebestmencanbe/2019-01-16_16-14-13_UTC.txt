Sexual assault is not just a women’s issue!! It is a human rights issue and it is EVERYONE’S job to call out rape culture. Men...call out your friends when they are doing something wrong and be apart of the movement to end sexual assault!!! For those who are already calling out their friends when they are doing something wrong, thank you for being empowered bystanders! #TheBestMenCanBe

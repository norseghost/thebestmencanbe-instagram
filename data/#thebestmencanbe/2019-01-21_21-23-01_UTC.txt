You don’t have to be a physically abusive person to be abusive. Using words to hurt others, using anger in your voice or simply the look of anger when speaking to someone out of defense is violence period.
•
Nonviolent communication starts at home. It starts on how we change the way we speak to each other. I haven’t mastered this, the programming is thick but my awareness of the unhealthy patterns is a start in the right direction.
•
Nonviolent ways of communicating:
✅Speak Kinder to yourself and to others
✅Learn to listen in silence even if it hurts, is what is being said true?
✅Breath before speaking
✅Don’t take things personally
✅Step away until you can speak without anger
✅Use words that will unite vs divide
•
These are tools I have used. Create your own. Learn from our gurus of the past and present. Break unhealthy patterns by trying new ways of dealing with things. Lead with an open heart and love.

“Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream was a manifestation of hope that humanity might one day get out of its own way by finding the courage to realize that love and nonviolence are not indicators of weakness but gifts of significant strength.” ―Aberjhani, Illuminated Corners: Collected Essays and Articles Volume I

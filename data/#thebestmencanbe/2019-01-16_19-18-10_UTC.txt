So...I've seen a ton of reaction from "men" over this today that's completely trashing Gillette. If this ad somehow offends you, or you feel threatened, maybe the next time you shave it's time for a little self-check in the mirror. As men we love to imagine ourselves as these big dicked, strong as hell, barrel chested badasses...and that's great, we're men, we should feel that way bc Testosterone is awesome. But what's wrong with using our strength to stand up for human decency, to raise our kids (specifically boys) that there's a time to fight and there's a time to talk it out. What's wrong with challenging other men when they act like assholes towards women? It just seems really "unmanly" to get offended off of an ad that's a war cry for men to stand for decency, and say that feminism is driving this ad. If your manlihood is so easily threatened by "snowflakes" are you even a man?ðŸ¤” #gillette

I got the privilege to share some words for my sons and hope it will be an inspiration to all of you as well. Head over to my stories to see the full letters, and share your own words for the men of tomorrow in the comments. #thebestmencanbe\n.\nDear Nikolay, Evyianne, and Elisey,\n.\nMy sons, it seems almost like yesterday that each of you was so small and were just beginning your lives here. Some of you are just on the verge of becoming a man, and the others are still beginning your journey. This year I wanted to do something special by giving this letter to each of you. I hope that you can remember these things as you begin each of your own journeys to becoming men and that you learn to be your best from watching me each day.\n.\nNikolay, you were our first born and first son. You opened my eyes to what it was like to be a father and all the joys and sometimes struggles that come with it. I hope you can follow my example to always stay true to who you are. Never lose your focus and remember that working your hardest towards that is worth it, and will always bring you happiness.\n.\nEvyianne, you brightened the day when you joined our family, and your positivity and energy is something that I love and cherish every day. I hope you continue to follow my lead in treating others with kindness and share that excitement for life that you have.\n.\nElisey, it is such a joy to see you grow and develop into the little man you are becoming. Already your love for life and curiosity at everything you see has made all of us better. As you have seen me constantly learn and improve, be sure to stay curious and explore each day.\n.\nMy sons, I love you all so much and it is always the best joy of my life to be your father and watch you each begin to walk your path in life. My hardest \u2013 and most worthwhile \u2013 job is to be a model for the men I hope you become and to work towards a better world for you to grow up in. I can\u2019t wait to see the people you will be."

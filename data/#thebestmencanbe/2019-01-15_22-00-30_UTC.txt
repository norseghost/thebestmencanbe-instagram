People are super upset at this new Gillette ad targeting toxic masculinity! The #MeToo inspired ad shows how everyday behaviors raise children in a society that normalizes sexist and misogynist practices....and many have decided to boycott @gillette and other @proctergamble products over it. How do you feel about this ad? Yay or nay? -----------------------------------

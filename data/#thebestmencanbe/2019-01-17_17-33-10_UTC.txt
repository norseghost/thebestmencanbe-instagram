Some People Seem to be Missing the Point of the New @gillette Ad, “We Believe: The Best Men Can Be.” The ad challenges viewers to confront issues like toxic masculinity and to abandon the cultural norm of “boys will be boys,” which has allowed offensive behaviors like bullying and sexual assault to pervade our society. One wouldn’t think that the message “be a better person” would garner so much hostility, and yet here we are. A large portion of backlash against the ad has come from people complaining that the concept of masculinity is under attack. Behaviors outlined in the ad, like bullying and harassment should not be the cornerstone of masculinity, and society as a whole needs to stop believing the false narrative that these heartless and violent behaviors are part of men’s genetics. NFL players to actors like Terry Crews and Justin Baldoni have talked about the importance of redefining masculinity. They exemplify that #TheBestMenCanBe is kind, vulnerable, loving, and emotional and have called on other men to step up and take action. This not only helps women and girls, but also lifts up men and boys.

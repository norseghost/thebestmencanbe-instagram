The new @gillette campaign titled The Best Men Can Be is committed to making purposeful social change, not just selling razors.
•
It’s all about redefining what their long-lasting tagline—“The Best a Man Can Get”—means in 2019. And for them, it’s about inspiring men to reflect on a new era of masculinity and challenging them to be better versions of themselves and better role models for boys.
•
It’s a lofty undertaking but quite fitting for a brand you use while looking in the mirror. And it’s resonating with audiences, where 72% of viewers now see Gillette as socially responsible—proving once again that purposeful marketing makes an impact. #believablebrands #purposedriven #thebestmencanbe #thebestamancanget

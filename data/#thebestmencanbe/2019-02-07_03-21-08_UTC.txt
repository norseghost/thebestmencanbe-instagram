Gillette has always been one of the manliest companies in the US, being the #1 at selling razors and other shaving products to the men around America yet the commercial they released about a month ago has changed everyone's opinion about this company.

The topic that this commercial focuses on is #toxicmasculinity. This topic has been around for a while, constantly pointing out several toxic behaviors amongst men such as promoting violence, classifying things by gender, and not letting children show their feelings.

The commercial has caused many men to be upset and make a decision to boycott the company to show their response. In my opinion, many men don't only have a toxic masculinity, they have a fragile masculinity.

Boys should be taught to love, they should be taught how to express themselves, how to be helpful. Boys should be playing with whatever toy they want, they should be living their lives peacefully by making their own decisions on how to be a child. Let the boys be who they want to be.

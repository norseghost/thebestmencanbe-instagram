This Father’s Day I’m joining @Gillette and @Fatherly to encourage the next generation of boys to be #TheBestMenCanBe.  Check out more #LettersToBoys at the link in my bio.  #GillettePartner 
Letter To My Son, 
We haven’t officially met yet... but you have made me a better man already. I know that it’s supposed to be my job to make you a better man... and hopefully I do, but you have already had that effect on me. You make me want to pass on all my good traits and leave out the bad. To make and share mainly good memories together and only a few sad. And that the sad memories will be ones we can both learn from, and be stronger for having experienced them together. I cannot wait to see the man you become... but don’t do it too fast. Take risks and learn from your mistakes...we can laugh at them later on – and I’ll tell you about all the mistakes I made and how they made me who I am as a man. Be nice to your mother... I’ll try to lead from example, because it’s my most important job as a dad to be a model for the man I hope you’ll become. But most importantly, be YOU. Chase your dreams and try to have as few regrets as possible. I’ll be there to help you when you need help... and I’ll be proudly watching you when you don’t. I know you aren’t here yet but you have made this Father’s Day a little more special for me. Can’t wait to meet you, little man.

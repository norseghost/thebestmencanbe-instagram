So impressed with Gillette’s new ad campaign. The effects of this kind of campaign transcend the advertising industry and help widen the definition of manhood. 
Of course, this is just a steppingstone in a long road ahead that we can all pave together.

The backlash this ad is receiving baffles me.
It’s not putting down men, it’s calling everyone - parents, friends, and strangers - to work together to help raise our standard of greatness. It’s not looking to erase masculinity, it’s helping make different expressions of manhood acceptable and praised, too.

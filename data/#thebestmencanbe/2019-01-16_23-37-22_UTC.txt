For years I have been praised for telling men to strive to be more, to call out bullshit insecure masculinity.

What's the difference between what I did in Being Caballero and what @gillette did in their commercial? That I'm a man? That it's under the banner of #Chivalry?

If your issue is the messenger, you are missing the point and you desperately need to wake up.

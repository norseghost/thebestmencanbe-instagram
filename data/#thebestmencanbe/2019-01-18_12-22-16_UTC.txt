BE THE BEST PERSON YOU CAN BE •

• 
No more blaming women for getting raped or sexually harassed (this too happened to me working as a #teacher @ #leroyhanes in #laverne #metoo for wearing certain clothes-OR by a man or anyone for that matter to feeling entitled to a woman’s body with absolutely no #consent *NO MEANS NO*
No more #mansplaining 
NO MORE BULLYING
No more #bigotry 
No more saying #boyswillbeboys 
No more #genderroles 
No more belittling of men who are in touch with their #divine feminine side who can showcase #emotions freely
No more #toxicmasculinity 
No more walking on eggshells trying to be PC. heck! Our own “leader” doesn’t even care how he speaks to women — let alone his wife(he doesn’t even hold the door for her)
When will #men be held accountable

When I started cross stitching and embroidery I was pretty anxious about what other men would think. Growing up surrounded by examples of masculinity that didn't necessarily line up with my own interests is hard (at best) but 2019 is all about reinventing masculinity and I'm going to be a part of that movement at every turn. I want to be an example of other men that, yes, its okay to be gentle, kind, and creative despite what society may make you think. âœŠ

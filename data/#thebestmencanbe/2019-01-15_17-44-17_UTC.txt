💀 -{ TOXIC MASCULINITY }- 💀
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is real. And there's no shame in NOT being toxic or masculine. Men aren't inherently jerks and we can stand up to the assholes that give men a bad name. No one is saying you're a bad person but if you identity with the bullies in the recent Gillette ad or feel attacked by these statements you're part of the problem. -----------------------------------------------------------------------
QOTD: Do you recycle clothing between family? I got this coat from my dad who used it for 10 years. Now it's mine. Re-using stuff helps the environment a lot ✨🌍

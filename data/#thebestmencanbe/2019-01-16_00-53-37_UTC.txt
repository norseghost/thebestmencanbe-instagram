Bravo @gillette!
⁣
This ad is getting highly polarized responses from viewers. ⁣
⁣
I think it sends a clear message around a topic that needs to be addressed — toxic masculinity is a problem. ⁣
⁣
Are all men this way? Absolutely not. ⁣
Are there enough issues related to this type of behavior to garner attention? Absolutely. ⁣
Do we need to have open dialogue around this to drive continued change toward equality? Absolutely again. ⁣
⁣
What do you think? ⁣

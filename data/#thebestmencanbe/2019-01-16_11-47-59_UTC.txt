"Gillette, the Procter & Gamble Co. brand that for three decades has used the tagline, “The Best A Man Can Get,” is building a new campaign around the #MeToo movement, a risky approach that will be the latest test of how successfully big consumer brands can navigate tricky social movements"

Brand experts warned that diving into complex and intrinsic social issues may come at the cost of alienating core customers whom may disagree, some went further to state Gillette missed the mark in comparison to Nike.

"The Gillette ad takes a different approach, according to Ms. Cantor. “The difference between this ad and Nike’s controversial ad is that Nike is saying, ‘Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything,’” Ms. Cantor said. “It’s an endorsement of conviction, but not telling you what to believe. They weren’t explicitly supporting a certain behavior or admonishing a certain behavior.” Susan Cantor, chief executive of branding firm RedPeak

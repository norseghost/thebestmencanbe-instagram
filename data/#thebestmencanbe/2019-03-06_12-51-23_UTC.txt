2020 VISION FOR WOMEN🧐—As we approach 2020 & 100 yrs of women having the right to vote in the US, I have a VISION of a day when women around the 🌍 will be viewed & treated as equals. DISCLAIMER—there are many men that DO NOT exhibit the behaviors I’ll describe in these upcoming posts, but unfortunately these are shared experiences of many of us 👩🏾‍🦱 👩🏼‍🦰👩🏻‍🦱👱🏼‍♀️👩🏽👩🏻 As @michelleobama stated “This 🌍 is unsafe for women” & discusses catcalling, groping, assault, being talked over & oppression & how “these are small CUTS that accumulate & sting over time.” Since FFLOTUS👸🏾shares specifics on her📔tour & @amandaseales also discusses #sexistcode w/examples in her #IBeKnowinHBO standup, I decided to share my own experiences of #sexistcode at work, gym, or amongst “friends.” Please stay tuned📺...

#OntheGilletteTip👉🏾—Another catalyst for my series of upcoming posts was the #WeBelieve #TheBestMenCanBe @gillette ad released 1/2019. If you haven’t 🧐 it then it’s a #mustsee on @youtube. As of today this commercial—simply calling out toxic male behaviors such as some mentioned☝🏾—has 777k likes & 1.4 MILLION DISLIKES😡...many of whom are women😧 It’s appalling that this is the state of our 🌍 #BeBetter #DoBetterIn2019💯

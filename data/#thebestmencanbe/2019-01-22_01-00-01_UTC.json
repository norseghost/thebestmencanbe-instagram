                        "text": "A year ago, I found myself disgusted, frustrated, and disappointed with who I\u2019d become. I couldn\u2019t stop arguing online about politics and social issues, and I had run out of love and empathy.  I\u2019d consistently fed my lesser self in what I thought was a noble attempt to defend my family and friends from threats to their well-being. But I realized that what my family and friends needed was me, present and whole, in their lives. \nRecently @gillette put out an ad that caused a lot of controversy. I wasn\u2019t able to watch the ad for days, but I did see the discussion that followed in the online shaving communities. It was a predictable toxic pattern of online social discourse: people attacking each other to score points with others who already agreed with them, believing the worst about one another, and reinforcing their own beliefs at each other\u2019s expense. No listening, no empathy, no love. It struck me how the ad was bringing out the worst in us, ironic considering its stated purpose.\n\nMammoth Soaps was born out of a desire to reverse my own downward trajectory and start putting something positive into the world. You may already know that one of our two goals is to raise awareness and funds to fight human trafficking. The other is to create scents that make us all think about something important, and challenge us to be better people.\n\nAds don\u2019t make us better people. Our politics and advocacy don\u2019t do it either. Being better takes hundreds of intentional choices, some big but mostly small, in the direction of greater love. \nA daily shaving ritual provides us the perfect opportunity to think about our choices. I hope each time you use a Mammoth scent, you\u2019ll think about the story behind it, and make a choice to be better. Not because an ad told you to, but because love is the best way to live.\n\nMuch love, and thanks for listening. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc18\u2764\ufe0f"

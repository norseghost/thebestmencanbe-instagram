It's so hilarious that some men are acting like headless chooks over @gillette's latest ad... I mean how fragile is your masculinity that you're offended by an ADVERTISEMENT?! If you're really so offended about an ad against being a jerk, you're probably a jerk that needs to do some self-improvement. Go eat a bag a limp dicks whilst you go whine some more on 4chan. P.S. Don't bother whining in my comments either, if you don't like what you see here, fuck off. #blockanddelete #thebestmencanbe #toxicmasculinity #metoo⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

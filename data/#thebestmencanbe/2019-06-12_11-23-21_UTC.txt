With #FathersDay coming up, I wanted to share a few words with my godson Leon – it’s advice I wish I truly understood earlier than I did, but I’m happy to say I’m striving to live by it on a daily basis.

I’m glad @Gillette and @Fatherly tasked me to do this as part of their #LettersToBoys program, to inspire the men of tomorrow to be their best selves, with words of wisdom from today. We’re all better off – as a society – if we all strive to be the best version of ourselves individually and inspire others to do the same. Check out the link in my bio for more heartfelt advice from other great men 👌🏼

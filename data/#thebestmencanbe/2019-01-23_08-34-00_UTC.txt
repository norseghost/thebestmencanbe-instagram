@gillette's “The Best Men Can Be” ad featured a row of similarly tight-lipped #men in front of grills, suggesting a shared concept among men for what men should look like and how they should behave, generally with an incorrigible “boys will be boys” mentality. Unfortunately, this mentality extends to men’s concept of their role in reproductive health—virtually nonexistent. Men commonly expect women to prepare/plan for AND prevent pregnancy. The ad is a spring board for The EMERGE Lab’s message that men can be better by engaging in reproductive and gender equity. #thebestmencanbe #reproductivehealth #masculinity

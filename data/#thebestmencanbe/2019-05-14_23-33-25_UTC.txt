Unlock Masculinity’s KEY of health is defined as, “taking care of your body through movement and nutrition.”⠀
⠀
When we as men take care of our physical health, it creates a domino effect. It fuels our progress and breathes energy into all areas of our life. ⠀
⠀
So men- tell us: ⠀
1. Why do YOU take care of your physical health?⠀
2. What has stood in your way before: knowledge of how OR motivation to do so??? ⠀

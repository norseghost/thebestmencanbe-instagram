To the feckless hacks @gillette , apparently men and boys are the problem and they're the only ones who need to change. Have they considered the impact that wankraggery such as this might have?
Maybe a depressed boy is trying his best and you're telling him his best isn't good enough. What do desperate or impressionable people do when their best isn't good enough? Don't think I need to fill in the blanks there.

Who in the intergalactic cheese rolling hell thought this was a good idea? 
Don't use virtue signalling to sell your products. All it does is piss people off and knee cap your bottom line.  Disgusting.  #TheBestMenCanBe #virtuesignaling #waronboys #waronmen #Gillette #menmatter

We love this campaign by @gillette. What do you think?

We talk an awful lot about the amazing women in the Shebah community, but we wanted to take a moment to shout out to the dads, husbands, sons and partners who support, love and respect the women in their lives everyday, and to the brave men who step in, step up and speak out when they see the wrong thing - thank you. We would not be here without your ally-ship.

We get a lot of message from men about how they can further support and share Shebah - and boy, have we have found a way! Please stay tuned as we'll be launching something soon that will ensure that Shebah's success is your success too.

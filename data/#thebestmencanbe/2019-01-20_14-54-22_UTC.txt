Have you guys seen the new @gillette #thebestmencanbe commercial?! Excuse my language but holy sh*t. Iâ€™ve watched it several times and itâ€™s brought me to tears. ðŸ˜¥ And itâ€™s inspired me to this idea: Iâ€™d like to host campaign photoshoots for causes this year to help bring awareness and conversation and light to important topics. I think Iâ€™ll start with parents and boys; how very much we all need to work hard at redefining masculinity in this country. Being a mother to a son this is a very sensitive and important topic to my own life and my own heart.

Have a look into one of @unlockmasculinity boys' events!

At this "Warrior Confidence" event, we partnered with @warriorchallengearena to foster one of the keys of healthy masculinity, confidence in our identity. Our activity time allowed these boys to not only get some energy out, but also build a relationship with each other as they worked together. During our "Impact Time," we had @jackoury49 speak to these boys about your confidence coming when you are being who you were created to be not just trying to "fit-in" with the crowd and having them realize they are stronger then they think they are. We also encouraged them to have the foundation of their self-confidence be what the people who truly care for them are saying about them and to celebrate themselves and others.

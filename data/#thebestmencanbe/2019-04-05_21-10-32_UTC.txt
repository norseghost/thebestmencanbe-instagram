The best men can be counselors that form deep bonds with kids who are having a hard time in school and in life. || “I spent time as a young man incarcerated. During that time I started to think about how I wanted to support others. Outside of the harm I caused, I wouldn't take back any of my mistakes because they're why I'm able to be patient with people. My experiences are why I'm able to look at a young man, see what he's going through and be able to offer something different.” — Ethan #TheBestMenCanBe || “Eight or nine years ago one of the kids I worked with told me he hadn't had a hug, he couldn't tell me the last time he was hugged. I realized that a real feeling of being loved was absent in so many young men’s lives. Ever since then, I try to hug every young man I work with and greet them with love. With permission and understanding, hugging the young people I work with is part of my day to day.“ || “I feel it's equally important for men, and even black men, to be able to connect. To be able to talk. To be able to have feelings. I think when I started talking about my own feelings, in my early 20s and started connecting with who I was, I was able to identify the needs of other people as well.” || “The students that I serve are one of the best things that have ever happened to me. The students that I serve are resilient, caring and brilliant. The students that I serve are young people who come from huge backgrounds that are finding themselves. The students that I serve are change makers. They have character. The students that I serve believe in social justice and they believe in justice as well. So, they're really passionate about making positive things happen in the world as much as interrupting negative things. The students that I serve are going to serve us. They're going to help make the world better. The students that I serve are important.” || Ethan is one example of #TheBestMenCanBe, and inspired by his compassionate approach with his students, Gillette is making a donation to Open School.

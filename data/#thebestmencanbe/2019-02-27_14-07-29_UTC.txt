The best men can be veteran firefighters who lead by example and promote diversity within their crew. “I was a part of the earliest crews in Oregon to diversify ethnically and along gender lines. Today you probably see that 30-40 percent of field level crew firefighters are women. And the firefighting science says we are all safer because of this diversity of opinions on our crews.” – Don || “My first fire assignment was in the summer of 1968. I've had assignments every year since then, so the math says I've got 50 years now. When I first went on fires, there were only men on the crews. Forest fire-fighting then was not generally seen as  a woman's occupation.” || "When my wife joined the forest service as a firefighter, there were not many women at that point. I think she probably resisted a lot of sexism. I met her working on a fire lookout, and she was on an engine. I think I impressed her because I had spent months ahead of time repairing an old refrigerator that I found there. I got the refrigerator working. I was able to make ice. When the crew came up there to work on the heli-spot, I was able to offer them iced tea. I think that caught her attention." || "In the fire culture, you are measured by how well you take care of your crew members and how much fire line you can build. How well do you adhere to the mission? That's all I need to know about you."

Late to the party, but I wanted to add my thoughts to the conversation surrounding Gillette’s new ad #TheBestMenCanBe. I think it’s another great campaign done by Kim Gehrig and has certainly had the intended impact as everyone seems to be talking about it now. Yes, it's an advertisement, but we now live in a time where corporations are asked to take a stand and what better way to create change than an ad seen by millions?

In my opinion, aggressive versions of masculinity has never been an attractive trait. Instead, it is the strength shown through compassion and sensitivity that makes one stand out in a crowd, and is the type of traits I believe would be the most important to encourage in any future son (or daughter) of mine. It boggles the mind why for many years society has falsely considered such traits exclusively feminine. We are all human beings who should stand up for injustice and treat others as we would like to be treated ourselves. Perhaps if empathy were given the importance it deserves, then the world would be a much different place.
.
Toxic masculinity has no place in our world. This ad is powerful as it’s not saying all men exhibit such traits, but that such ideas are simply a dated social construct of masculinity that we now need to break from, and that by stepping away from such ideas is where the real strength lies.

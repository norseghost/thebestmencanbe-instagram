Now lets take a moment to reflect on the social media game. We know the best content is organic and from the heart. We love positivity, people who are authentic and real. Social action. Change. You get it, you live it, you're here. Put a clarendon filter on it, a decent blurb and off we go!
Now, our infamous generation is coming of age. We have the money and those multinationals are wanting it... but we're a hard market, we operate outside of the ego or at least we want to feel like we are as we shop. We want to feel virtuous as we're buying - enter @proctergamble and @gillette with their new video... but take a moment and head over to @gillettevenus ... seem familiar? 
Well, you guys... I hate to break it to you... but this is actually just network marketing.  I know because I do it. It's a now very legitimate thing, so much so a multi billion dollar company is getting in on the action too. If you want to see how it should be done - look up "doterra vetiver sourcing" on YouTube. Amazing product. Real life change. Haitian kids having running water and going to school. Amazing!
The trouble is with Gillette, is that no real change has happened. Have a look in your local supermarket and tell me what you see. Still segregated, massively price differentiated basics, some pink, some blue but they do the same thing? High waste plastic? Yup. #nochange 
I've just done an IGTV video on this, going into more detail on P+G and all the brands they run. There's details in my stories too re: safety razors from an insta friend @ohrosetravels - check it out!

This is my face when I hear somebody cry “BUT NOT ALL MEN”.
🙄🙄🙄

It was hard to miss that discussion in the past days and the rage around the vision that “men can do better”. Again, I’m very convinced and thankful that my environment has been mindful and self-reflecting as always. All of my friends were unable to see how anyone could be offended by the latest Gillette advertisement.

I hope none of my friends avoided to talk with me about it because of fear. Listen, I am all open to hear different point of views but if your argument is weak- I’ll point that out.

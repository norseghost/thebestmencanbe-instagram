Last week @gillette made an advert that quickly became controversial. Through the beginning of the video you can see what society as too often let happened as different behavior that are problematic such as sexism, toxic masculinity or even bullying.

Gillette even show that in their past advert they were preaching those kind of of behavior by having the tagline « the best a man can get ». They have now changed it to «  the best men can be ». Even though this advert got so many critics, they are showing that the men of today and their behavior are being what by « the boys of today who will be the men of tomorrow ».
The second part of the advert shows how men can respond in different situation to break those toxic mechanisms that are really issues in today’s society. This advert is worth to be shown to everyone to make a change about it, like the advert is telling us.

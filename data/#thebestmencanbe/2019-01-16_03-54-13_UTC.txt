We can debate whether 'socially conscious' ad campaigns are effective, opportunistic, and / or important to our culture...all valid questions. But what's revealing are the negative responses to the content of this campaign, the critiques burning with vitriol. Even more sickening than the hatred coming from men is the anger spewed by womenâ€”given that 1 in 3 will experience some form of contact sexual violence in their lifetime. The insidious effects of pay inequality and the right to control our own bodies are also directly related to the #metoo movement.

The images and situations featured in this ad are clear cut cases of abuse, misogyny and bullying, and @gillette  suggests that men be allies in the age of #metoo. That the ad has sparked indignation and threats of boycott says a lot about how we ended up with this president, and why people continue to support him. Toxic masculinity is a way of life, ingrained in our culture, and the mere suggestion that we take a closer look at the damage it does, causes a backlash so fierce, that progress seems very much a goal in the far distance. Yes, it's 2019, but an enormous portion of the population still refuses to evolve. -KMW #resist .

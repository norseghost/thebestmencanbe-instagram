[SWIPE FOR FULL STORY>>>] You fucking don't deserve Gillette!! All you men who are offended by the #Gillette commercial are the danger of all our rights and especially womens. Your TOXIC MASCULINITY isn't something you just CAN'T own up to. Your bs manners are not for you to blame on society- you fkn wake up and make the choice every day to be the asshole you are to the people around you. If you think #boycottgillette will make you more of a man? Remember you will have to pick that razor up from the toilet bowl, as you will have to pick up your pride when you realize it's 2019 now and nobody will stand with you. Bye toxic men- I'm about to double my Gillette orders... #metoo #v√•gatala #toxicmasculinity #sexualassault #rawmodels #thebestmencanbe

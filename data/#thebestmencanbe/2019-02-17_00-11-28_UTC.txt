Sexuality has a huge role in masculinity for every man. But sex and sexuality is a tough topic to tackle and by no means do we want to position our organization as an expert in this area. But to serve men and boys in the best way possible, we want to engage in this topic. That's why we need your help.

We are in the beginning stages of collecting information and resources on healthy sexuality. So tell us, what are some organizations that you know of that are promoting good information?

What are resources that are helping parents talk to kids about safety as it relates to abuse, pornography, etc? What are organizations that help men with sexual addictions?

So as we collectively join together to serve our boys and men, comment below on any answers you have to the questions above.

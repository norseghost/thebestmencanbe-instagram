boys can be loving
boys can be shy
boys can be sad
boys can be self-conscious
boys can be intelligent

BUT
.
"boys can't be afraid"
"boys can't be gentle"
"boys can't be weak"
"boys can't be timid"
"boys can't be hurt"
"boys can't look soft"
"boys can't be powerless"
"boys don't cry"

isn't this just boys being boys?
we shouldn't encourage all this "boys will be boys" stuff. letâ€™s promote a healthier masculinity that lets boys be their true selves.

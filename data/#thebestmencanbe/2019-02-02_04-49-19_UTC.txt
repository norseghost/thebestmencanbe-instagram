Open up your fist ✊🏽✋🏽
A misconception
You can fight like this✋🏽🤚🏽
In praise ✨
With the power of prayer🙏🏽
If God's on our side we can take the stairs
To the heavens🌅

Surrender to the love.
Stop making enemies, instead find a way to connect, find something in common. We could all use a bit more love in the world.
Share a smile, give a hug, say thank you, hold the door open... use words that unite vs divide. 
Open your fist and it will open your heart.
Only then you can pray with a full open heart to help guid those who have also lost their way. 🙏🏽😔

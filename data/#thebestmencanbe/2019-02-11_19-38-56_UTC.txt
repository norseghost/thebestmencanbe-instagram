My Brother @heartcenteredman provides us with this beautiful mantra yesterday in our @sacredsons group of the Embodied Masculinity Course.
Thank you, brother, for inspiring this post.

Self Doubt:
I’m not sure when you entered my life or how do you ended up in my mind. For years I struggled and partially still do with feeling “not good enough”.
•
Maybe you entered when my father left my side? Or that time in class where the boys wanted to jump me because I was different from them?
•
Regardless of how you and I combined into one soul, you are part of me but you will no longer be part of my train of thought. With this mantra, I release you to be free to just be me no matter what anyone else thinks, I AM good enough for me.
•
And so it is. ✨🙏🏽✨

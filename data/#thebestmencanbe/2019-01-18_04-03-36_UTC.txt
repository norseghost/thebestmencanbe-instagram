It took me a few days to catch on to all the buzz surrounding this mighty message. It is a message of wisdom, a battle cry in the war for our next generation of young men, and one that I fully stand behind. As I watched the commercial and the societal situations that were courageously brought to the surface, my heart both broke and was mended as the message they conveyed unfolded. Bravo Gillette for continuing a current conversation and being Brave enough to move forward in creating a culture of accountability and positivity. As we move forward in molding the next generation I can only wish the principles brought about for men and women alike! Just as the men of tomorrow watch, so do the women... Let us do our part in creating a culture of kindness! For it is only by challenging ourselves to do more that we can get closer to our best!

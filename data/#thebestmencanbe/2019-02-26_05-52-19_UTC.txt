@TerryCrews recently got into it with @realDLHughley on Twitter, and I think it’s safe to say that DL got owned. Terry is a paragon of healthy masculinity. He’s a shining example of how to address toxic masculinity successfully. He’s a compassionate ally to women and sexual assault survivors; he talks honestly and openly about his feelings and his own experience with sexual assault, and he does it all without feeling threatened or defensive of his manhood. Terry is confident and secure in his masculinity, and he doesn’t feel the need to tear anyone else down because of it.
.
DL, on the other hand, is an insecure man with masculinity so fragile that he feels threatened by Terry’s actions that don’t adhere to the stereotypes of straight men. He is so outraged by Terry’s healthy display of masculinity that he tries to tear him down and basically blames Terry for being a victim of sexual assault. DL is so defensive of patriarchal gender norms that he feels the need to censure one of his peers for acting in an adverse way to heteronormative gender roles. This is toxic masculinity.
.
The funny thing is, when you juxtapose @TerryCrews with @realDLHughley, who do you think comes across as more “masculine”? The physically intimidating, tall, bald musclehead Terry Crews, of course. Terry is a perfect example that, as a dude, you can work on yourself to eliminate all toxic traits while still remaining a masculine MAN.
.
Men need to stop feeling threatened by criticism of toxic masculinity and learn to listen. No more excusing bad behavior and defending sexual assaulters at the expense of their victims. If all men learned to address their toxic behaviors and express their emotions in a healthy manner, the world would become a much safer, healthier, and happier place for everyone.

“We live in a country that “school shooting” is somewhat normal and routine. I remember the day that the Columbine shooting happened. I remember being confused because I had never seen or heard that schools could have someone walk in with a gun and shoot students. Since 1999, I like everyone else in America have been witness to hundreds of school shootings since and most recently STEM elementary here in Colorado. ⠀
.⠀
In 2007, the Virginia Tech shooting happened and I was a high school senior that was just 5 weeks away from graduating. That day 11 of my friends and my English teacher created “A Day Without Hate” in response to what we saw and what we felt. We asked “what if?” Our ideas could work. We wanted to create a better future for our school and have students feel safe, connected, and loved so nothing like that would ever happen in our school. ⠀

I call this generation the Sleeping Giant, because they are the largest generation in the history of the world. They have more power than any other group of people on the planet right now and they are just now starting to wake up to what they are capable of when they work together for the common good. ⠀
⠀
Right now, we have a window of opportunity to create a massive positive change in society and it calls for the voice, heart, and ideas of this generation. The Sleeping Giant is beginning to wake up and I am excited to watch as they realize that Love has always been their superpower.” To contact Adam directly to speak at your event or school email: adambaca45@yahoo.com

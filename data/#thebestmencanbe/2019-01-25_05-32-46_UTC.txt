#TheBestMenCanBe campaign urges men to not only check their own behavior but to intervene when they see others engaging in negative behaviors and harmful stereotypes associated with a style of manhood that needs to be left in the past.
To coincide with their campaign, Gillette pledged to donate $3 Million over the next three years charities such as Boys & Girls Club of America.

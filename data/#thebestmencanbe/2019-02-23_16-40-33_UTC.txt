Masculinity is becoming such a relevant topic. Whether it is the @gillette “The Best Men Can Be” campaign or at the My Brother’s Keeper event with @barackobama and @stephencurry30, we @unlockmasculinity are excited that so many companies and people are understanding the need for boys and men outreach. 
It is not about making men feel bad about being men, it is about helping men of all ages be human as @barackobama describes in the video first. “If you are confident about your strength, you don’t need to put someone else down. Show me by lifting someone else up.” – Barack Obama

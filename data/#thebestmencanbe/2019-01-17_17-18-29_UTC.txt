I'm a fan of the @gillette #TheBestMenCanBe campaign and since some trolls are calling for a boycott, I decided to pick up some extra razors and shaving creme for a local #homeless shelter. If you believe that men should take responsibility for their actions and treat others with respect and dignity, and you'd like to help your local shelter, consider picking up some Gillette shaving supplies for those in need.

And we hope Gillette continues their great work by taking a lead in eliminating the "pink tax" on female shaving products.

Gillette shared the ad, called “We Believe,” on social media, January 14th. The razor brand revealed that the ad is part of the company’s larger effort called “The Best Men Can Be,” which seeks to “actively challenge the stereotypes and expectations of what it means to be a man everywhere you see Gillette.” The “We Believe” commercial opens on depictions of bullying, sexual harassment, and the refrain of “boys will be boys,” while a voiceover says that excusing this behavior needs to end. The ad even directly references the #MeToo movement, before calling on men to be better.

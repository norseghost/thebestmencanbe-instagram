#YourBodyIsAWonderland
@johnmayer 
We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body Is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it.

You want love?
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is‚Ä¶ ‚úÖA lyrics from one of my favourite songs to positively honour our body no matter what shapes and sizes. Our body is ours to own it and no one can dictate us what to do with it. I am feeling #BodyPositive in front and working with @iamadamlannon though I am little bit jealous of his tone muscled abs! üòä Thank you for making me feel more comfortable to accept myself #AdamLannon ‚ù§Ô∏è. üì∏ @peachyraith ‚Ä¢

What a refreshing take on advertising to men. We think it is so important not define masculinity just based on macho behaviour. Gone are the days of showing your dominance in the workplace, at home or with friends by being the alpha male.

#MeToo shone a light on the world and made us all accountable for what is acceptable behaviour. If we want an equal and fair world for our children, our wives, our husbands, our colleagues etc, then we need to all show that we are changing and to be vocal when others aren't.

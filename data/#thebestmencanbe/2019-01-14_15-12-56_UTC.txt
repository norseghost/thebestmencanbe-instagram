Are we still doing #MCM ?  I don’t care if we aren’t , i’m still going to brag on mine. You guys - Jon gets up with the boys every • single • morning (I sleep in until 9 on most days)! 😳🤭 He brings me tea in bed, gets the boys dressed, takes them to school/swim class - all the while continuing to run our business [flawlessly]. I’m in awe of all he can do, even with the lack of sleep from #toddlers. Dad life looks so good on you 🏆

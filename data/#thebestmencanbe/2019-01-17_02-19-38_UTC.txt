Of late, every time an issue is raised and the aspect of gender is brought about, people recklessly open their mouths to blame feminism and feminists. Even those who do not have the slightest clue what feminism is, and have been exposed to toxic, loud women who have abused the term. 
Now, I hear that feminists are being blamed for this @gillette commercial.
I am genuinely surprised by anyone who is against this commercial, since if you ask me, it is challenging men to be the best versions of themselves - something I would love to see everyone become (men and women alike). If you’re of this worldview, I have a few questions for you:

1. Is it really an issue if men are called to be better? Do better?
2. Are you really okay with having just a handful of men treat your mothers, sisters, nieces, daughters and wives with the respect and love that they deserve 
3. Why is it really wrong for #Gillette to have addressed this issue through this commercial?
4. How is it that you want your sons, nephews and younger relatives to behave when they are older? Why don’t you want the men in their lives to set the right example for them? And when you are reminded the importance of having those men in these young boys’ lives setting examples for them, why are you so mad about it?
5. How are feminists to blame for this commercial?
6. Why are feminists to blame for this commercial?

Please respond in order of questions, with a detailed answer for each question.

Thank you. .

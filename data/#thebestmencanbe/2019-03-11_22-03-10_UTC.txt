The best men can be leaders of support groups for men who are dealing with abuse, suicide and addiction. || “To me the primary purpose of why we are there is to listen to each other, and for each man to feel heard, because sometimes that's the only medicine there is.“ – Grant 
#TheBestMenCanBe || “Today I see men facing problems of patience, anger, shame, guilt, isolation, lack of empowerment to move forward, unable to take risks. The men who do the work to address those issues tend to be more fulfilled, more empowered. But those issues by and large never go away.” || “I have been seeking my father's approval since I was 11. I’m now in my 70s. Regardless of how much work I do or have done, I will always be seeking that man's approval. What I've learned in doing this work for over two decades is that most men are in the same place I am.” || “Life comes back and kicks me in the ass unless I keep doing the work to keep my demons in check. That means showing up hopefully once a week to a circle of men where it is safe to be honest, empathetic, compassionate, and nonjudgmental. Those traits to me are what it means to be a man.” || Grant is another example of #TheBestMenCanBe. Inspired by his work as an advocate for men, we are donating to an organization committed to creating communities of dedicated men who are able to guide and support at-risk, often fatherless, boys on their journey to manhood. We're committed to helping me drive change that matters. Join us at TheBestMenCanBe.org. #LinkinBio

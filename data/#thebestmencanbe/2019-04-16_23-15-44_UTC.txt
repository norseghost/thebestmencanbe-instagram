This past weekend I spent four days in service and help nourish the stomachs of over 100 men at the @sacredsons Men’s Convergence ll.

I had the honor of cooking and being of service next to these powerful chefs @heartcenteredman @kevinlucas1700 @felipefasano

We sang, we cried, we hugged and danced. It was powerful. To cook for so long, stand for so long, to clean and prep for all these men while they do some deep powerful work to find some freedom from these chains that life has given us was such a humbling experience. Sharing warm food filled with joy and love brought a deep awareness to what it is to really serve. What it is to put others before your own wants and needs and to do it without resentment or jealousy but with love and happiness that these men are finding their purpose and truth.

It is an honor being a Sacred Son, and I was shown that I need to step into my roll as a man coming into an elder roll. My age came up for me a lot. 36 going on 40, I felt the calling of the great spirit as the chefs and I climbed the boulders and thoughts in my head filled with doubts of my full potential. I quickly slapped myself out of it and climbed with them until we reached the top.

When was the last time you felt that way? When did you gather with men and not have a drop of alcohol on a 3 day of camping adventure and was fully accepted with all your shadows and doubts about yourself without judgment and ridicule for expressing who you are?
Well it’s time you do. “WHO WE ARE
We are Brothers. Fathers. Husbands. Uncles.
We are here to help men heal and awaken to their true power through circles, workshops, retreats, and online courses.  We are Sacred Sons. We are rising.” - Sacred Sons

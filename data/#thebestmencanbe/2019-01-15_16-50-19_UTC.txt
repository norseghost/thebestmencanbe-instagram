#Repost from @venusrackpack with @regram.app ... A viral ad from #Gillette implores men to stop harassing women in public, stand up against bullying and encourages to stop using the excuse “boys will be boys”. Unfortunately millions of men are fuming pissed. Note: If an ad that suggests treating women with respect, encourages to stand up against bullying and be the best man you can be upsets you, you need to seriously reevaluate your life.

Jamie here. With #fathersday coming up, I wanted to share a few words for my son Cooper--It's a thank you really. He changed everything for me. He showed me a world that I never knew existed. He taught me to see the world differently and strive to make it a better place.
I'm honored that @gillette and @fatherly asked me to do this as part of their #letterstoboys program, to inspire the men of tomorrow to be their best selves. So often, fathers to kids with disabilities seem to be overlooked when it comes to the support aspect. Not to mention that society often tells us it is not masculine to share our feelings. Now I see things differently, and I hope the men of tomorrow will too.

A month ago I (Adam) spoke on a men’s panel at a MOP’s meeting (mothers of preschoolers). @rrcarvadamops .⠀
It was clear after that panel men need to experience what women have access to in a culture like MOPS. ⠀
.⠀
As adult men there are few places we can talk about our lives in a nonjudgmental environment. We’re conditioned to feel like we need to do life on our own and just “man up.”⠀
.⠀
Yet, guys, we were made to be in a “tribe.” We were made to ⠀
•cary each other’s burdens, ⠀
•experience life together, ⠀
•be inspired and mentored by other men. ⠀
.⠀
Our networking events provide a space to experience the KEY of COMMUNITY. Our first book club has been awesome to see come together and experience the power of community. ⠀
.⠀
If this is what you’re craving, join our mailing list at unlockmasculinity.com and stay in the know about what’s next. ⠀
⠀
👊 Truly, we want you to be part of this community because together we can build a foundation for healthy masculinity.

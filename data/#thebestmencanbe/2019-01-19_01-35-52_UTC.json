He works out, he\u2019s a good shot, and can ride a bicycle 100 miles in a short day. He provides for his family. If he doesn\u2019t know how to do something, he\u2019ll research it until he can do it. He\u2019s volunteered in various roles at church over the years and now he\u2019s a volunteer firefighter for our town. He loves cars and has owned more than I can say ranging in style from an old Power Wagon to a modern Aston Martin. He can debate politics, shop with his girls, spend an afternoon at Fenway or under a car or in the woods or at the beach, make us laugh until we cry, mend broken hearts, encourage, and sometimes even cook. Back when ridiculous people asked \u201cwhen are you going to try for a boy?\u201d he put them in their place by letting them know how thankful he was for his daughters. He\u2019s not overly expressive, but Gabriella, Jordan, and I know he respects us and loves us and would do anything to protect us. He\u2019s so many good things I couldn\u2019t possibly write it all. He\u2019s manly and I\u2019m thankful for that. I love that we are so different. I don\u2019t want him to be like me. I want him to be the man he was meant to be. He is not a male chauvinist. He is not misogynistic. His strength doesn\u2019t make him a brute. His masculinity doesn\u2019t make him toxic. He is a man who is learning to change with the times while holding strong to his moral and ethical beliefs and standing firm in his faith. He\u2019s a good man. I loved how the #Gillette commercial shows that gentlemen respect women, men can be masculine without being mean, being tough doesn\u2019t mean being rough, and to be strong means to stand for what is right. To all my female friends and relatives, I encourage you to share some of the things you love about a man you are close to. Build him up and encourage him to be #thebestmencanbe"

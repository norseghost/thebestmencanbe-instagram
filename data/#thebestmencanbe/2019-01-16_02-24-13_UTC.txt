A friend of mine sent me the full video early this morning, and it made me so happy!

For so long we as a nation have allowed toxic masculinity to thrive within our culture as an acceptable norm.
💫
Unfortunately, the male ego is so precious, there is only so much that we women can do before men become offended and think we’ve over stepped our boundaries.
💪🏾
Men have to step up to the plate, leave the old cliche that boys will be boys in the past and hold their brothers accountable. 👬
Don’t misquote me. This is a joint effort— a woman’s place is in the movement. Teamwork makes the dream work, and together we are strong.
💫
Remember, how you treat others is a direct reflection of how you feel about yourself.

@gillette took action against toxic masculinity and nailed it! Would love to work with the corporation in the future! #TeachOurBoys #TheBestMenCanBe has a nice ring to it! 💫
Let’s promote accountability in 2019!

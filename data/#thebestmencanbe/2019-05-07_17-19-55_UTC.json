There is more to this though. There are times when the situation, perceived problem or pain does not require anything else but our presence.\n\nWe want to fix in order to feel useful, worthy or of value. I know I have in the past. We don\u2019t realise that our own insecurities prevent us from going deeper with our loved ones. Our beloved at times simply wants to be seen and heard.\n\nNo fixing, nothing more, just sheer masculine presence. This doesn\u2019t mean that we discount ourselves, nor does it mean that we allow ourselves to be abused or mistreated in anyway.

Hold, hold strong, be present, listen, don\u2019t fix, don\u2019t offer advice AND\u2026 place a time on that container. Revisit it, if required and place the structure around it.\n\nIt does no good to anyone to allow the expression (anger, grief, sadness, frustration, projections, pains, etc.) to be prolonged. We all need respite. In my experience as the masculine it becomes imperative that I place structure around the expression... to read more visit Stefanos Page.\n\n#sacredmasculinity #sacredmasculine #menswork  #menscircle #consciousness #mindfulness #healing #selflove #selfcare #gowithin #awakening #thebestmencanbe #thegrandawakening #womenswork #familywork #divinefeminine #choosetoheal #authenticity #beauthenticwithyourself #authentic #spirit #spiritguides"

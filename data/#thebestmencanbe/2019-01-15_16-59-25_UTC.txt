From the “The Best a Man Can Get” to “The Best Men Can Be”, Gillette are reshaping the way we view masculinity!!
.
For 30 years the iconic slogan ‘The Best a Man Can Get’ has been synonymous with the men’s shaving brand. That was until yesterday, when Gillette unveiled their new ad campaign called ‘’We Believe”. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, the new campaign challenges toxic representations of what it means to be a man. No more excuses for bad behaviour. No more ‘boys will be boys’. Men can do better! “We believe” in the Best of Men.” 🙌 And just when you think the campaign couldn’t get any better, it does… Gillette have pledged to donate at least $1 million annually, over the next three years, to organizations designed to help men of all ages "achieve their personal best". Bravo Gillette #LeadTheWay 👏

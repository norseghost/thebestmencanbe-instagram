As we all get ready to celebrate amazing men for #FathersDay this weekend, @gillette and @fatherly are asking men to share letters of advice with boys of today, helping them on the journey to being the best men they can be tomorrow. I wrote a letter to my unborn son that I believe translates to all young men in the world. 
Check out my Instagram stories for more of the letter. Snippet below. #LetterstoBoys #TheBestMenCanBe #GillettePartner “I can’t wait to teach you how to work hard towards your goals, to never give up, to be respectful, to honor women, to treat your friends with kindness, to love and to have integrity with every decision you make. I hope that I’ll lead by example on all of these things, and that you’ll find these traits easy to emulate because you’ll be surrounded by strong role models.

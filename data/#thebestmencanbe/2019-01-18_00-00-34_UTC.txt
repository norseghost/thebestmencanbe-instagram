Well...if you can’t beat them, join them!⁣
⁣
⁣
Seeing as my news feed is full of people commentating the Gillette advert I thought it weigh in on the debate...⁣
⁣
⁣
...well, let’s just talk about a more sustainable and SUPER AFFORDABLE option for EVERYONE when it comes to shaving.⁣
⁣
⁣
Although a metal razor like this costs around £30 it will save you ALL THE MONEY in the long run.⁣
⁣
⁣
Ladies, you are aware that we pay Pink Tax on razors right? To top it off they’re not as sharp as they should be and are designed to blunt quickly...total rip off. We don’t need five blades for a super close shave, just one good one. Don’t believe the marketing lies!⁣
⁣
⁣
Stainless steel razor blades are super cheap (£9 for 100!) and if you dismantle your razor and allow it to dry after use each blade can last up to 6 months.⁣
⁣
⁣
100 blades x 6 months of use each = 50 years of use from a £9 box - in short, a lifetime of shaving.⁣
⁣
⁣
I think the last time I bought razors in the UK it cost around £20 for 5 disposable heads. Extortionate! ⁣
⁣
⁣
⁣
This one really is a no brainer for both the lads and the ladies. ⁣
⁣
⁣
And yes, wild hippy herbivores like me don’t abandon all cultural norms in a bid to be more sustainable...it is possible to keep your luxuries, your grooming routine and cut down your footprint. ⁣
⁣
⁣
What is stopping you?⁣

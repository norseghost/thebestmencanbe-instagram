Recently @gillette dropped their new #TheBestMenCanBe campaign challenging men to call out examples of toxic masculinity in themselves and others.
•
The ad features men of all races displaying various actions that could be described as toxic and other men in their lives challenging them to do better. Not surprisingly the ad has already received much negative pushback from men describing the ad and what it stands for as emasculating men of their masculinity. What do y’all think of the ad?

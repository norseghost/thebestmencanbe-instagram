My reaction to all the men criticising the @gillette commercial about toxic masculinity. The ad criticises bullying, sexual harassment and poor “boys will be boys” excuses - welcome to Twenty-Nine-Queen. You can be manly without sexually harassing women. You can be manly without being homophobic. You can be manly without mansplaining when a woman has already explained the solution. You can be manly without bullying your peers. You can be manly and be a feminist. You can be manly, feminine or anywhere in between, but most importantly, be a decent human being. #gillette #toxicmasculinity #metoo #thebestmencanbe

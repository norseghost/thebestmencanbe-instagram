This #FathersDay, I’m celebrating what it means to be a father, a man, and how to be #TheBestMenCanBe in life. @Gillette and @Fatherly are asking men to share letters of advice to boys in their life, and I’ve decided to write a letter to my younger, closeted self. If you could write a letter to a boy in your life, what would you say? Our journey to be better has just begun. Tag and share your #LettersToBoys here. #GillettePartner

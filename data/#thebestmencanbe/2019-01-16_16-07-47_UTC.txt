Sure it‚Äôs just a marketing ploy to sell a product but I gotta say I really like the new short movie from Gillette. As a newly single dad of 2 boys this hit home. As a dad (and grown man) it‚Äôs our responsibility to teach and model our values to boys growing up. Teach them respect for others regardless. To lead by example honestly and integrity. It‚Äôs not easy by any stretch but it‚Äôs what we‚Äôre called to do. 
Oh and if an ad about being a good person offends you... well maybe you‚Äôre the one that needs to watch it a few more times. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è -

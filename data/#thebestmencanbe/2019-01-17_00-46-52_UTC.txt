This is from the #gillette advert about the best men can be. I want to focus on this scene only. Forget the obvious virtue signalling, never mind the blatant "racism" and just skip over the "sexism", I want you to see that Gillette is satanic. In this scene when the men chant "boys will be boys" (the fact that they are chanting is creepy in itself but very appropriate once you get it) they all have a barbeque grill at the level of their groins and the barbeques are cooking. They are simulating castration. Gillette is literally burning your groin to feminise you. This is a spell. This layer in this advert reveals that the whole feminist movement is satanic, not by accident but intentionally. More and more of the democratic arms are admitting that they are into witchcraft, which is the worship of the evil that came out of darkness. As of now this advert has more dislikes than likes and reading the YouTube comments it seems like Gillette is removing dislikes and comments (which reveals how disingenuous YouTube is) and the underlying reason in my opinion why people are disliking it, is because yes in the conscious matter people disagree with the propaganda but really the subconscious is picking up the negative draconian energy and is rebuking it. Stay safe.

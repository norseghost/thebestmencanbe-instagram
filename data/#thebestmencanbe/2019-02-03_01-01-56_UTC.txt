Strive to be “top of heart” rather than “top of mind.” 💙
.
According to @SimonSinek in #StartWithWhy, the part of the brain (limbic) responsible for all our feelings, such as trust and loyalty, human behavior and decision making; it forms the emotional connection—the heart—but has no capacity for language. The newer part of the brain (Neocortex) is responsible for the rational, analytical thought, words/language, but isn’t responsible for decision making/behavior. Emotional connection first before reason. 🧠
.
With that in mind, today I had the honor of guest lecturing again for this master’s class on Reputation Management at @fiu_sipa. We discussed various corporate social responsibility and cause marketing campaigns, such as Gillette’s recent #TheBestMenCanBe ad, Nike’s “Believe In Something”, Uber vs Lyft’s campaigns, politicized #SuperBowl ads that worked and didn’t work, and more.📢
.
Overall my message was: .
1) Start with and create campaigns/causes that authentically share your mission and values; .
2) Make sure the message aligns with your target audience; .
3) Continue to proactively share content to build the “trust bank” (that can combat or at least mitigate any potential negative news). 🏦
.
Think of ways you can position your brand to make a difference through your actions and campaigns that have heart, are relatable, and align with your ideal clients. I look forward to seeing which brands hit or miss the mark tomorrow at the ad bowl! 🎯

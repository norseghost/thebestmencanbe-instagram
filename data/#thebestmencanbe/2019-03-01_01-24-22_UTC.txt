I teamed up with @Gillette to be a part of their #TheBestMenCanBe #ad campaign. In the next few weeks we’ll see stories from a diverse population of men, who are advocates, mentors and leaders in their community. I’m beyond humbled for the opportunity to be a part of something so special.  These stories will change narratives, perspectives, hearts, and inspire change . Learn more at TheBestMenCanBe.org

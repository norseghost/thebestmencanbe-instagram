‘To Be A Man’: a portrait series challenging the concept of toxic masculinity.
.
Adam. Canada. “It’s okay for me to ask for help. There are a few studies that says suicide rates are much higher for men than for women. This is because men and boys are much less likely to seek help when they need it. The idea of needing to ask for help shouldn’t make you feel like less of a man. Anyone, regardless of their gender, should feel they can ask for help. This should be accepted and it should be what is considered normal.”

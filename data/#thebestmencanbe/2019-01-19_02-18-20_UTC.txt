#thebestmencanbe is man enough to call out another man when his behavior toward another woman is out of line!!!! Thank you!!!!You shouldn’t have to find yourself explaining the basic elements of human respect to anyone. Normal people understand the fundamental concepts of respect.

This isn’t an attack on ALL men. If the shoe fits ..wear it!!This is the ultimate measure of a mans character! 
Bottom line: If he’s not good enough to stand up to another man who is mistreating a woman, he’s not good enough for me and he shouldn’t be good enough for you ladies either!!! Thank you @Gillette for working towards shaping the men of tomorrow! ❤️❤️ #thebestmencanbe

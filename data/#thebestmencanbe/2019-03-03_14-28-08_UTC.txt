I USED to be the Wounded Man. Until I got my heart shattered into pieces watching my older sister, my idol, ruin her life to heroin addiction. Between her addiction, the abuse from my father and abuse to myself, I was fed up with suffering. My PAIN was the catalyst for my transformation. NOW I choose love. NOW I choose to embrace my feelings and go DEEP into my heart and soul. No more hiding.

If you are into podcast, I just posted a new episode on my podcast, The Awake With Jake Show: #51: The Awakened Man. Available on all places with podcast.

hey fam, just a word about the new Gillette  commercial. If you don't think there is such a thing as Toxic Masculinity then you are fooling yourself. It's real and it's frightening. I try not to get into these things but I can't help but take a side. I am on the side of Men who don't have to act like cavemen and then blame it on "Boys will be Boys" No. No that is NOT how we should be. Bravo, Gillette. And if my swearing offends you, good. I meant it to. And I also meant what I said in the video. If you don't like my standing up and applauding, unfollow me. Hell, boycott me. Tell all the world that THIS is what I am saying. Boom, see if I care.

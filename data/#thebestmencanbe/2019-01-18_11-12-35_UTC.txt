🔥The commercial that hurts sexists. 
Did you guys see the latest Gillette commercial? I personally found it a great and powerful ad, speaking directly from one of the most iconic male brand and product type. Honestly I can’t understand the debate all around it’s message, cuz I think it’s pretty obvious that men should change some of their behaviors, starting from us. Starting from me too. But maybe this ad hurt some big men right where we never shave enough, and I hope it was intense. 😁 #thebestmencanbe

#GillettePartner ﻿
As we head into #FathersDay @Gillette and @Fatherly are asking men to share letters of advice with the boys in their life, helping to shape the next generation of men to the #TheBestMenCanBe. I’ve written my letter to my future son. Check out the link in my bio to read more #LetterstoBoys﻿

"Dear son,﻿
﻿
I've learned more from my failures than I ever have from my successes. It’s from being confronted with failure that I was also taught what's truly important in life. I learned that life is best lived when you focus on what you do have, not on what you don't, or on what you have lost. While I never wish for you to face the types of failures that I've encountered, what I can do is prepare you for whatever difficulties you may encounter so you learn from them, and can become your best self as a result."

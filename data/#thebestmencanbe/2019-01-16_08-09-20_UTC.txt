Have you seen this on your feed yet? Early this week, the razor blade brand Gillette released a video that is causing a social media storm and generating a conversation on toxic masculinity. The campaign spins off of the company's tagline of "The best a man can get" to #TheBestMenCanBe speak to issues in the #MeToo era. 
While the video has largely been praised for generating a conversation on bullying and harassment, it's also generated great controversy and backlash from some men's groups, who have even said will boycott the company. How can men be better role models for gender equality? 
Our next fellowship will explore many of these topics in our workshops. Be part of the conversation and change. Apply before Jan 30. See link in bio!

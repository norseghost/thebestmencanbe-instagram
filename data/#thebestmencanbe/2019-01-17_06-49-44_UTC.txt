The first pic is from a CNBC article discussing the #thebestmencanbe ad from Gillette and explores more of what research is teaching us about the challenges that men face within their masculinity context in the world

The second quote is from the newly issued “Guidelines for the Psychological Practice with Boys and Men” released just a few days ago from the American Psychological Association (APA). This is SO exciting, psychology is addressing major stereotypes of what it is to be a man and how our current system of care can best support healthy boys and men within our society!

Men, we don’t want you hurting. 
Men, we don’t want you to suffer.
Men, we want you to be able to honor yourselves above societal expectations and any fear that you aren’t enough.
However you woke up today...whatever direction you want to take your life...enjoying with abandon all the things that bring you genuine joy...
You are enough! 
Please take good care of yourself and of one another.
We love you ♥️ .

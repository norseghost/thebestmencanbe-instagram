Thank you, @gillette for helping to break the stigma of addiction, one man at a time! #wedorecover #soberaf Posted @withrepost • @gillette The best men can be recovering addicts who turn their lives around, and then help others do the same. || “I'm really delving into what it means to be a man and a father. Really recognizing the capacity that I have to make positive change in my community, especially for people in recovery. I would like people to know that men can and do change, if given the space to do it. And I'm living proof of that.” - Tony #TheBestMenCanBe || “A lot of the values that I developed at a young age were from the street—from partying, crime. It wasn't cool to be kind. You had to be tough, you didn't let people in. You didn't express your emotions. I don't think anyone really asked me, ‘What's going on with you? Why are you so angry?” || “Growing up, I thought homosexuality was wrong. My mentor in recovery turns out to be this older gay man. He's not a masculine man who beats people up, he's a really smart, intelligent, kind, older gay man. What brought us together is recovery. Recovery was that conduit and I believe that if we can bring other people together in the same room with a common goal, a lot of people have the ability to use compassion and empathy to achieve something, even if they have differences. “ || “I’m the director of a nonprofit where young people of thirty-five and under go to get addiction recovery support. I remember when I was 12, crying in my bed, wishing there was a place to go where people understood me. The 12-year-old Tony would be happy to know that the 33-year-old Tony is creating that place for other young men to go.” || Tony is another example of #TheBestMenCanBe. Inspired by his work, Gillette is making a donation to his non-profit, 4th Dimension Recovery Center. We’re committed to helping men drive change that matters.

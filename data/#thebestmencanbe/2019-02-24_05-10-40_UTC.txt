Often, the mind will look for an object (an idea, person or situation) and use it to project its own lack of balance and inner peace, moving the attention away from itself and forcing it into an area of imagination. The mind has the tendency to get swept away into examining possibilities that may never come true, because it lacks the training and healing it needs to remain in the present moment.

Of course, there are times when we should use our energy to consider the future and plan properly. With growing self-awareness we can better detect when it is actually useful to spend time thinking of the future and past versus the times when we are unnecessarily creating more burdens in the mind.

Sending love to all beings. May we all understand that inner peace requires consistent cultivation. May we all realize that letting go of the future and the past is a necessary foundation of inner peace. May we all be happy and free.

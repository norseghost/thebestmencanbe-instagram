@Gillette has released a video ad campaign tagged #TheBestMenCanBe with a rather strong social justice message. The tagline is inspired by their tagline, launched 30 years ago - The Best A Man Can Get.

The ad addresses toxic masculinity, the negative image and abuse associated with the male gender, with the centre of its message revolving around taking corrective actions to curb these menaces from transferring to the younger generation. 
But Gillette is not stopping at just awareness. To make their vision of the Best Men Can Be a reality, they will be distributing $1 Million per year for the next three years to non-profit organizations executing the most interesting and impactful programs designed to help men of all ages achieve their personal best.

As expected, the video has garnered diverse opinions from commendation to backlash, withdrawal from brand loyalists and also the sworn allegiance of new loyalists. 
What do you think of the ad? Is the ad worth all this outrage? Or is it something that absolutely needed to be said? Letâ€™s talk.

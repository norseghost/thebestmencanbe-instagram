After watching this add by @gillette I was very happy to see a (primarily) men’s product company has wanted to comment on and has spoken out about this increasingly popular topic. 
But going through the Facebook and YouTube comments I am really disappointed by the overwhelming number of negative comments in comparison to supportive comments! Almost nothing positive about the message and purpose of the advertisement was there, men and a shockingly high amount of women commenting about their disdain towards the ad and the topic in general - it’s really disappointing to see.. Teach your sons, brothers and friends that it’s not ok and that it’s doing a huge disservice to themselves, those around them and society as a whole. (photo: 2015) #thebestmencanbe #gillette

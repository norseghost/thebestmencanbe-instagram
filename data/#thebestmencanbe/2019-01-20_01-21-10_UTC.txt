I marched today to stand in solidarity with the countless women who have shaped me into the person I am today.  The time is now to grant them the rights they all deserve.  To my fellow men: women are human beings.  We are not superior to them and it’s about time we start acting like it. After all, men of quality don’t fear equality. #thebestmencanbe

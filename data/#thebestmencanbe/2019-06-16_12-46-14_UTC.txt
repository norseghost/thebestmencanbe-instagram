I would like to thank the man who taught me how to be strong and showed me that when things go wrong, even in the toughest times in life, you have to face it and brave your way through. The man who gave a big impact to my life and the reason why I’m here, my papa Gomer!

Thank you so much for everything papa! I may not have a photo with you this Father’s Day but I want to let you know that I LOVE YOU!

Swipe left to check the photo of my Papa, Bagets parin diba? Sa kanya daw ako nag mana eh! Same kaming alagang @gillette!

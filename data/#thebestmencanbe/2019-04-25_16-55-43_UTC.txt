W O R K... My husband (Adam) and I have been drawn to finding tools to do this “work” of getting healthy as men and women.⠀
.⠀
Brenè speaks directly to the shame storm we’re up against. She says for women it’s appearance and body image and for men it’s the perception of being weak.  See my story for a blip from her Netflix special! 🙌) ⠀

Adam just launched the website to his non-profit: Unlock Masculinity. His vision is to serve boys and men and build a foundation for healthy. One key element he shares is that true strength is being vulnerable. But women- listen up- we must do our own “work” to create space for men to do this. And girls, we can! 💪⠀

.⠀
@unlockmasculinity is about to share some great communication tools for y’all to better love the men in your life. You won’t want to miss out. 😉 ⠀

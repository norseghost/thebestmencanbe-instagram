“Is this the best a man can get?" asks a new ad by Gillette that has been the subject of intense social media reaction since its debut on Monday.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Some have praised it for addressing toxic masculinity and the #metoo movement. While others have described it as condescending and virtue-signalling.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Procter and Gamble which own Gillette have said they are aware of the controversy and have no plans to pull the ad as they hope it furthers the conversation. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

♡BOYS TODAY . MEN TOMORROW♡ 
Being a #boymum use to really upset me. Dont get me wrong, I love my boys! and I wouldn't change them for the world but I couldn't help but feel as though I was missing out on the chance to raise a woman, a strong powerful woman. 
But I quickly realized I have an even better job!! I have the opportunity, no privilege to raise 2 boys into men of tomorrow. 
Men who will respect, love and support their woman when the time comes. Men who will create change  who will suck up for the underdog and fight for what is right. "The Boys who are watching today will be the Men of tomorrow" - @gillette

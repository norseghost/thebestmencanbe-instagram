The lifting up ðŸ’›
Itâ€™s not just about the tears, we donâ€™t just cry to heal the traumas.

We lift each other up by playing, wrestling, chanting cheers of love and bravery.

We service what is needed to lift a brother up after pouring their hearts and souls out.

We remind each other of our own individual divine power, our inner warrior and sacred responsibilities to our children, partners, extended family, friends and Mother Earth. 
We know itâ€™s difficult doing it alone so we encourage to stick together.

The time of the lone wolf is gone.

We welcome YOU to the pac.
We are waiting for you.
You are waiting for you to return to your truest essence.

                        "text": "Recently, Gillet came out with a short film commenting on toxic masculinity & I have seen numerous people sharing their thoughts & opinions. I have been reading through them all quietly, & to be completely frank, it\u2019s been overwhelming & I still can\u2019t pretend to know anything.\n\u2728\nI don\u2019t know what it feels like to be sexually assaulted or raped. I do know, however, numerous women who have been sexually assaulted & raped. Many of whom I have called close friends at one point or another in my short lifetime. & because I am a huge feeler (though you may not realize it at first), I empathize strongly with the women who have been strong enough to share that piece of their story with me. & I am sorry. I am sorry no one stood up for you & I am sorry your voice was silenced. \u2728\nHear me out when I say this, though, please. I read an article this morning on Desiring God commenting on this commercial. It said \u201cmasculine men lead, protect, initiate, love, sacrifice, work, & worship...\u201d A man can do all this & still be introverted, bashful, caring, hospitable, & kind; not all characteristics associated with \u201cman.\u201d I know enough great men in my life (my dad, my Grampy, old pastors & current leaders in my church, friends even...) who embody what it means to be a good well-rounded man simply because I see them live it out. \u2728\nWomen and Men: We have value. All of us. Maybe this is a blanket statement what will make people roar with opinions far and wide, but I really think we can all do so much better. I think we all need to start listening and stop casting so much judgment. \u2728\nWomen, Feminists, Moms, Sisters: Listen to your men with open ears, your brothers, your friends. Hear them out. Men, Dads, Brothers: Listen to your women with open ears, listen to your sisters, and listen to your friends. \u2728\nIt\u2019s simple. There are things to be gained from both sides of the story. Have you taken a second to really listen? You might be surprised to hear that at the end of the day, that\u2019s all anyone really wants. To be heard, seen, known, and loved.\n\u2728\nI\u2019ll go now. Thanks for hearing me out.\n\u2728\n#Gillet #toxicmasculinity #thebestmencanbe #webelieve #listen #hearmeout #littlelion #faith"

***SWIPE👈🏻***
@Gillette just released this wonderful ad against toxic masculinity and aimed at promoting the healthy expression of men’s emotions, so naturally, the incels, wife abusers, sexual assaulters, and misogynists of all kinds rose up to renounce the ad because NO ONE tells them to self-reflect and learn to be a better person! How dare they?! 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
.
This ad is fantastic. It gave me chills. I’m hoping more brands pick up this kind of positive messaging against the harmful behavior of men that leads to horrible violence, sexual assault, and presidents like the pussy grabber-in-chief. I’ll only be purchasing @Gillette razors going forward. We, as men, can be better, and we should always strive to be our best. #TheBestMenCanBe #BoysWillBeHeldAccountableForTheirActions

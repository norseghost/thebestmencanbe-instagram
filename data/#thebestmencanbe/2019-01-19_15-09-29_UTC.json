Another wrote that 'being a man is not a disease nor a pathology,' adding that 'it is grotesque to repeatedly ascribe collective guilt onto half of humanity known as men.'\"\n\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffb\nLike \"how dare you market products to us and ask us to exhibit human decency?\" \ud83d\ude02\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udfff\nThis sounds like #notallmen or what people of a certain hue say when they hear words like \"white privilege\" and \"white supremacy.\" #alllivesmatter\n\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffc\nReminds me of when people boycotted Nike and #ColinKaepernick by cutting out the check mark/swoosh from their clothes.\n\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\nNewsflash: Nike and @gillette already have your money (but if you insist on being a fool, please dispose of your razors safely).\n\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffe\nIt saddens me deeply that people are more upset at being told to be morally decent than they are about #racism and #toxicmasculinity. It bothers me that this ad is seen as divisive -- and not by just a few people on the fringe.\n\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udfff\nIf you are offended when an ad or campaign challenges your privilege, ask yourself, \"Why?\"\n\ud83d\udc68\nNo one is saying that there is anything wrong with being a man -- unless you define masculinity as denigrating others. Then it's problematic. You may not ascribe to toxic masculinity but you do benefit from patriarchy and #maleprivilege. And if you do not *actively* do your part to question your privilege, dismantle toxic masculinity and use your privilege to protect and promote the voices of the vulnerable other, you are part of the problem. You are complicit. Silence is complicity. Be offended.\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\nSo this ad basically says what we've been saying since time immemorial and definitely since #metoo: #dobetter.\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\nWe only ask that men do better because we know that they can. You have the potential to be better men."

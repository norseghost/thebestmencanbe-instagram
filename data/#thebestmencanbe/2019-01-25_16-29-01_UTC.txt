Yall see this yet? Shortly after @gillette released their #TheBestMenCanBe short film, watch company @egardwatchco released an ad titled, "What is a man? A response to Gillette" A clip of the ad seen above shows men in various walks of life, while the narrator asks questions like: "Is a man brave?", "Is a man vulnerable?", Is a man trying?" ending with the narrator saying, "We see the good in men."
•
On our episode this week, we commented on how while we fully support the Gillette ad, it did little to empower men the ways in which some ads for women empower women. While we acknowledge how important it is to call each other out for our problematic behaviors, sometimes in terms of reaching men, by simply calling each other out with no level of empathy or understanding the messaging will fall flat.
•
On the other hand, while the Egard ad is a masterpiece in empowering men it certainly falls flat in terms of accountability which the Gillette ad is aiming to accomplish.
•
There's a delicate balance of accountability and compassion that we've even began to navigate through on the microphones because we don't want to run the risk of shutting folks out who may benefit from the message.
•
Together, messages from both ads are necessary. Accountability from Gillette. Empowerment from Egard.
•
But what do yall think?

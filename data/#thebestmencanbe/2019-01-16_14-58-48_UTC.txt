Watch @gillette’s latest ad campaign and pay attention! ✊❤️We’re living through a pivotal cultural shift in social consciousness. This is about the DAILY manner in which women globally, i.e; HALF the world’s population is treated. And this can no longer fly. .

For men burned by this ad, there’s many more women watching gutted, traumatised, hurt...remembering each scenario in our lives. More often than not, it’s quiet men on the sideline enabling misogyny & abuse by louder men, the angrier men. Don’t be either. MAN UP. .

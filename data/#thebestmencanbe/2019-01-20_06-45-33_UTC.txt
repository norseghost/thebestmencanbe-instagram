#TheBestMenCanBe I’m excited that this is a thing. I’m glad we’re out in the open about this. I’m glad we’re being called out on behaviors that have been the norms for a long time. This isn’t about belittling. This isn’t about a hierarchy of power. This is about being a better human. It’s about standing for what’s right and accountability. It’s about the oldest law since the dawn of humanity, Love your neighbor as yourself. People don’t always want to change, but change is good. There will always be backlash. Just know that there’s nothing wrong for standing out, for breaking the norms, for doing something different because it makes you better. So here’s to being better men. To being loving men. To being open, and vulnerable men. Men who listen and not yell. Who discuss and not fight. Men who share their hurts and feelings. Cause I’m striving to be #TheBestMenCanBe #gillette

I'm sure there's theories out there about what I'm about to write. But this is my view, my observation, my experiences.

Men have always been the leaders, the breadwinners, the sole income bearers, women have been dependent on men. These are the factors that a man would measure his manhood against, and in competition only with other men.

Now, we're in an era, where women are rising, have risen. And are adopting more and more of the traits that since forever only men would have had. Rather than a minority of women that are working, it's more so the norm. This has lead to a manhood crisis.

Men of respect, confidence and intelligence help fuel their mother's, sisters', daughters', wife's success. But there are men, particularly within our society, that cannot fathom that a woman is flourishing. That she is earning more, that she has more assets, or that she is simply more.

And so, what form of "masculinity" comes forward in such a desperate unfortunate man's brain? Physical strength. Force. Cursing. Blackmail.

I had always thought it was lack of education that made a man feel insecure and behave out of jealousy towards the independent woman. But, not at all. Highly educated men, in highly respectable positions within the workplace and society, seem to think it's okay to behave beastly behind the closed doors of their home. The height of hypocrisy.

Badly raised boys, turn out to become badly behaved men. Yes, ofcourse there are also badly raised girls who become badly behaved women, this is not the greater problem of our time.

I think of myself facing the same scenarios I have faced, but in another country, where I don't have the readily available resources such as reliance on the police, the justice system, the nhs- the support system that is requires for a woman to just survive! And it sends shivers down my spine, my heart aches for all those girls silenced and oppressed, living a life of compromise.

All this suffering, just for the sake of a weak man's struggle at befitting the man-made definition of 'masculinity'.

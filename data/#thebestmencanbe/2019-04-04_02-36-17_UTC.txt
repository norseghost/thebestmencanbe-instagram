Tonight was the first meeting of the @unlockmasculinity Book Club! It is always impactful when a group of men meet with the intention of growing as men and living life together!

For our first book, we are reading @lewishowes book, "The Mask of Masculinity." The book is all about these versions of ourselves we create as men to not have to deal with our emotions and to be accepted socially.

If you are interested in joining the Denver-based club, you can go to our website and subscribe to the email list! www.unlockcoach.com/unlock-masculinity

“Fitting in is about assessing a situation and becoming who you need to be to be accepted. Belonging, on the other hand, doesn’t require us to change who we are; it requires us to be who we are.” -Brené Brown⠀
⠀
💡More than ever we need our young men to know that belonging to the conviction of who they are is more valuable than fitting in. ⠀

📝 You’ll find a worksheet called, “Building Confidence 101” on our website. This tool is a gift for the young men in your life that have external pressure to “fit in.” This tool gives them the understanding of how to practice accepting & believing in who they are. ⠀

👊 Confidence is something we build from the inside out.

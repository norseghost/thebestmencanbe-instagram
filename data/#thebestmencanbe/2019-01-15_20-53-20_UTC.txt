I’m not a perfect man but it’s my responsibility to be the best man, father, friend, husband, and person that I can be. I make mistakes everyday and promise to minimize those as I learn to be my best.

My son and daughter will read this one day and I hope by then - this behavior will be common knowledge.

I’d like to start a challenge that doesn’t cost you a penny. This is to challenge you to reach out to other men. It’s about time that men held each other accountable. 
This won’t get any of us notoriety, millions of followers or free Gillette. This WILL however show that as men we will be better and do it together even if it’s just an Instagram post of promise. Standing up and saying YOU will protect the persecuted, the bullied and harassed with knowledge that it’s not okay anymore. It was never okay.

‘To Be A Man’: a portrait series challenging the concept of toxic masculinity.
.
Caspar. The Netherlands. "It's okay for me to be insecure. I have always felt like, as a man, I am supposed to be confident and dominant, and not supposed to ever feel shy or insecure. This pressure of masculinity made it very difficult for me to deal with my insecurities. Learning to accept them helped a lot in understanding, and in the end, dealing with them."

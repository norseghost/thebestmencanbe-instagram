Back in January, Gillette flipped their long time tag line on its head. Instead of portraying a lifestyle that was “the best a man can get”, they challenged the traditional view of masculinity asking viewers if the current state is “the best that men can be”. Despite some controversy, the brand is continuing to push for what they believe, launching an ad featuring a trans man shaving his beard for the first time with the help of his supportive father. While some Twitter users responded saying the brand should “stay in its lane” the majority of reactions have been overwhelmingly positive. We’re definitely #TeamGillette on this one! 📷: @gillette

Woke advertising >>> not woke advertising.

Have you watched Gillette’s “We Believe: The Best Men Can Be” commercial yet?!
The ad attempts to tackle toxic male masculinity by challenging men to take a deep look at themselves in the mirror (while they shave, of course). This ad is labeled controversial, however, we are all for it! Any piece of media (whether designed to sell a product or not) that deals with social issues by presenting a better world is a win in our book! Every ad is trying to sell you something, at least Gillette is trying to sell us their product wrapped up in a world of less toxic masculinity!

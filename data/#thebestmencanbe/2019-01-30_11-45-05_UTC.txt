#Trans* Yes, I used the @gillette to shave destructive hair in my face, legs and everywhere before I had my hair laser removal. And tonight would be the opening night of #MyDadsGapYear @theparktheatre which I feel the fear of letting go of those self destructing thoughts won’t be anymore part of my life. I want to be happy, I want to live authentically and truthfully, and I need to be #me.❤️🏳️‍🌈 In support to all the men out there. Isn’t it time you stopped excusing bad behavior? #PressureOff #TheBestMenCanBe

What am I missing? Why are men offended? The ad is simply saying to the good men out there that you need to start calling out yuh bredrin dem for their bad behaviour. It doesn't say all men are bad but it does call out the behaviour that needs to stop. This is not mass feminist conspiracy to marginalize men. Just saying do better. Maybe I'm missing something. #TheBestMenCanBe #DoBetter

#gillette #thebestmencanbe @gillette is a wonderful ad campaign. You take a brand that has cashed in on the old tropes of masculinity for generations, and they're stepping up their game. Well done. You should see the vitriol kneejerk from insecure men though. Wha? Amazing in 2019... check out the ad to see what these pinheads are threatening to boycott.

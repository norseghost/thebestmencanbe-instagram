KEY #1. COMMUNICATION.
üëâThis is a tough one for guys. From a young age we are conditioned to believe that ‚Äúman up‚Äù means to stuff our fears, concerns and feelings down. 
Studies show that boys as young as 5 years old begin putting on a mask and pretending to be someone that they are not in certain situations  because is it more socially acceptable. 
Then, skip ahead to when a man gets married and his partner wants him to open up and be real, but the problem is, men traditionally haven‚Äôt practiced how to do this. Men have not learned how to validate and communicate our feelings, so they shut down.

As guys we get stuck in a rut and only talk with each other about the approved topics such as: ‚Ä¢sports‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢jobs‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢weather‚Ä¢ 
So how can we break the surface conversation and dig deeper? 
Here‚Äôs a good place to start:

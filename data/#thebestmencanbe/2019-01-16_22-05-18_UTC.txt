"The ego isn't wrong; it's just unconscious. When you observe the ego in yourself, you are beginning to go BEYOND it. Don't take the ego too seriously. When you detect egoic behavior in yourself, smile. At times you may even laugh. How could humanity have been taken in by this for so long? Above all, know that the ego isn't personal. It isn't who you are. If you consider the ego to be your personal problem, that's just more ego."

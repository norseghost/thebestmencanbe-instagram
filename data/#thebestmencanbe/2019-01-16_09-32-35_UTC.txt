This Ad by Gillette set more🔥 to my 💓. The underlying theme of this vid #TheBestMenCanBe is 1 of the reasons I feel both honored and excited by the mission God gave my hubby Charlie & I :

To raise (now) 3 #BoysToMen.

We both try to give them a solid foundation of Christ-inspired #respect, love, joy, #justice & kindness towards others...
Intentionally #RaisingKings. .
. 
Because beyond  being Male & Female, we are human beings made in the image of God, and so each one of us - - because of that inherent nature - - is valuable & deserves to be treated with #dignity.
.
.

Now, I have a message to 2 types of people:
1. To those who sometimes complain that God blessed them with children who are "only" (in quotes because I feel even bad to write out that thought) of 1 sex (I said sex, not gender) - - whether all boys or all girls;
 and
2. (Let me shout this for the back of the class) 🗣️ : to those who tell you (the parent) that "next time, you should conceive a...boy/girl" (1. As if you are the one choosing🙄, 2. As if what you already have is negligible 😒),
.
. 
Listen: When God gives you something, it's generally for you to be a good steward of  His blessing (e.g. This Planet, your Health, children, your career, your mind, your heart, your neighbors, your family, your country).
.
. 
We should try to understand "why did God entrust me with this specific blessing?" "How will my use of this benefit the world, contribute to causes grander than myself and be a blessing to others?" God's blessings to each of us, is rarely JUST for us. .
. 
The question I ask myself these days is, "How will my use of God's blessing in my #life contribute to creating part of the #KingdomOfGod on Earth?"
.
. 
With my kids, I believe God wants me to raise them right, according to His Purpose and #values,  exemplified by Jesus: LOVE, TRUTH, JUSTICE, FAITH, JOY, HOPE, not for themselves but for the growth of their community and for the establishment of God's #KingdomOnEarth. .

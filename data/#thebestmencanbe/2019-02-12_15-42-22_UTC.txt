With #ValentinesDay just DAYS away and so many headlines focusing on men who do things so HORRIBLY wrong, @bloomex_canada challenged a number of men to show an entirely different side of masculinity by integrating flowers into their favourite pastimes. Some men put flowers in their locker rooms, some wove them into their beards. ⠀
⠀
But me? I've always been a creative soul and spent some time drawing a self-portrait that I HOPE speaks for itself.⠀
⠀
It doesn't HAVE to be #ValentinesDay to get flowers for the people you care about—or even for YOURSELF—but if there's any time of year to remember that, this one's as good as any! ⠀

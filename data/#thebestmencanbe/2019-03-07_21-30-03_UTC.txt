The best men can be mentors who teach art to underserved and incarcerated kids. “In my experience young people who are locked up are desperate for a creative outlet. Few programs existed like that for kids in detention so I created one. Some people are critical of our project, I've heard things like, ‘Oh, what are you going to do,  create a summer camp for these kids?’ Well, maybe that's what they needed. Maybe they wouldn't have been incarcerated if they'd had a chance to be  involved in something positive like this earlier on in their lives.” - Carlos #TheBestMenCanBe||“I've been around gang culture, it's something that I've often been exposed to. I know why kids are attracted to gang life. There is a camaraderie, a whole family element that was attractive to me when I was going through rough patches with my own family. Gang affiliation is really about young people trying to find a place to be, trying to have ownership of a space, trying to create an identity that's their own.“||“When any breaker steps into the circle we know that's a vulnerable space. We always cheer them on. We clap when they get in there. If somebody else is giving some negative energy we clap louder so that we can change that energy. Then eventually that person starts clapping too. We're here to encourage each other. We're a family here. It doesn't matter what our backgrounds are or affiliations are or anything like that. We're here to support each other. Each of us are better when we do that.”||“For me, dealing with my emotions can be frightening. In my life sometimes I go right to frustration and anger. I have to remind myself when certain things are triggered that I have to take a step back, to take a breath and to think about those around me. And to work through it.  If I’m going to lead young people by example I have to walk the walk.” Carlos’ work is another example of #TheBestMenCanBe, and inspired by his ability to reach at-risk kids through art, Gillette is making a donation to his non-profit, Morpheus Youth Project. We’re committed to helping men drive change that matters. Join us at TheBestMenCanBe.org #LinkinBio

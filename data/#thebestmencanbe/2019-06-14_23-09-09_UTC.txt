This #FathersDay @Gillette and @Fatherly are asking men to write letters of advice to the boys in their lives to inspire and encourage them to become #TheBestMenCanBe. I thought about all the different things I could tell my boys but one thing seemed to stand out above the rest- enjoy life, even when it puts challenges in your way. As their dad, I not only want to tell them, but I want to show them every day that life can and should be fun and that it’s way too short to focus on the negative. I will be an example to them each day as they grow to be the best men they can be, even in – and especially in - those times of adversity. So far, I think I’m doing okay.

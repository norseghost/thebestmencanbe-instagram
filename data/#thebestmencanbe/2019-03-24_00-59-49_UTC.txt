This man is magic and I am honored to share this very vulnerable video with you all.
There is no shame is tearing down the walls of trauma. It’s gonna be ugly, snotty but that’s the work and it’s gonna hurt before it feels better.
Thank you for sharing these moments with me @lightningtree_mg . Love you brother. 🙏🏽💛

Framework for Healthy Masculinity 🌿

Michael Gay, Therapist and Gestalt Facilitator specializing in Wilderness Therapy, shares on the  importance setting space for men to connect and feel. “Something’s missing in the way that we live where that’s not happening”. Sacred Sons Convergence is that place.

Join us and our epic team of facilitators at Convergence II April 12-14th in the beautiful high desert, east of San Diego, CA as we shift paradigms and tap into the depths of our potential as men!⚡️

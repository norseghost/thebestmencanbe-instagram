This boy has my heart. ❤️ We're halfway into year two of school for my little man, and every school morning still makes my heart ache a little (for excitement and separation anxiety 🙈) as he jumps out of the car, carrying his huge dino backpack. I feel it even more on Fridays since the husband is off work and he drives the car, and I get to watch my little man as he gets out of the car and walks away. Sometimes he stops, looks at the car, and waves. I mean, melts me. 😍

Fellow crazy-attached Mamas, when does it get easier? Or will I have this feeling forever? Ha. 😅💕

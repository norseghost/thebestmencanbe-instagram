Have you ever felt emasculated? In a relationship? At work? By just being a Black man in this country? Coming off of last week's new @gillette Gillette #TheBestMenCanBe ad, and the American Psychological Association's new guidelines for treating men and boys we discuss the response from large numbers of men who felt that these efforts are emasculating men and taking part in the constant effort to attack traditional masculinity.

We talk about why these efforts are NOT emasculating men and discuss through healthy visions of masculinity, emasculation does not exist. However we do acknowledge that for some men who may have not yet defined masculinity for themselves, emasculation does exist. Link in bio.

#Gillette made an advertisement that targets the grave issues of toxic masculinity, sexual harassment, and the #MeToo movement. It also encourages men to hold other men accountable for mistreating a woman and stand up to them when such instances occur.

While this is a great way to convey a powerful message, it was bound to hurt the egos of several men who felt attacked and decided to boycott the brand altogether.

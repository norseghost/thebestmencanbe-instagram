#Gillette, I raise a #razor to my face’s facet of my #Januhairy mission. Submission acknowledged but mission accomplished. I can have feminine facial hair and rock it 🚀 with a feminine identity and presentation. The pressure to conform to binary expectations is CO$TLY❗️ I faced it. W/ no  safe space to save grace I had to shave face to save face.
⏩It’s *that* bad. ⏪
While #feminism fuels my ability to make due, over the last week, overt #toxicmasculinity and transmisogyny made me want to #BlastOff these cosmetic strings. Take a #laser to a 💎  and see what happens!  Lasers could help me focus my light and keep beaming. 
My words and pictures now #orbit the #universe. Infinite. Eternal.
I’m an extraterrestrial
so extra and special
I’m extracelestial
In my #multiverse 
My #heavenly body gravitates toward #Venus. 
I am an amazing #goddess of #love. 
You can empower yourself with this sort of #selflove in your personal monologue.  There is nothing wrong with trying to counterbalance all the put-downs.

•To really take steps in the right direction, men must learn to honour women by respecting their personal space. Instead of blaming women, men should restrain themselves and not gawk at them or humiliate them.
•We are all born of women hence we must treat them with the kindness they deserve. An honourable man will always treat women with honour and integrity. Women should not be coerced to do anything against their will. They deserve an equal chance at life, in all spheres - education, careers, finance, inheritance and the freedom to make life-decisions.
•We are all equal in the eyes of God since we have all been created from the same source. God does not discriminate between the efforts of a man or woman. 
As equal human beings we should not discriminate against women. Whether it’s at the workplace or anywhere else, women deserve equal opportunities.
•Men need to actively enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong between themselves for us to really make a difference. 
Remember “women are not a garment you wear and undress however you like. They are honored and have their rights.” (Umar ibn Al-Khattab)

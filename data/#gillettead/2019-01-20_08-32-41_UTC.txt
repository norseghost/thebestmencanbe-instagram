Thought I would write my thoughts on this Gillette ad. I thought it was garbage and ate empty to preach new age feminist crap on us. Tell me what is toxic masculinity and how does it differ from just being masculine?
Also why is it in the ad, whenever they showed men being bad, it was always white men and when it was men being good, it was black guys?
Just another attempt to say white men are the devil.. People wonder why men are so angered by this but imagine how it would have gone if this ad was about women being better and portrayed them all with those who lie about rape, taking children away from loving fathers, abusing partners in relationships and so on. Better believe people at Gillette would have lost jobs, provided a public apology and protests in the streets from outraged women. Hypocrisy at best

In my book if your frigging upset over an ad saying HEY be more kind.. be more supportive.  Then yeah U deserve to be cut like a hair and not grow back.  @Regrann from @motherofsnot - The best a man can be?

Have you seen it? Gillette made an ad that said, like, maybe, mayyyyyyyyybe it’s a good thing for men to be kind, express emotions healthily, help prevent bullying and not sexually harass people… and the internet is losing its freaking mind!
😱
That’s right, amongst all the crappy things going on in the world today, a bunch of men are crying because an ad suggested they should be good to women?!!
🤨
It never says men are dicks. 
It never says men aren’t already doing great. 
It never even says ‘all men’ (even though ALL the men’s rights activists decided to hear it)
💥
It  just joins the 21st century conversation, chewing the olde cud about how everyone deserves equal treatment, regardless of what’s going on between their legs.
👏🏻👏🏻
Boys can cry. Women deserve respect. Being kind is cool.
💥
And of course the likes of the delightful @thepiersmorgan and Gad Saad are disgusted. 
Waffling on about ‘virtue signaling’ and the troops landing at Normandy (sorry, what?)
😑
Frankly my friends, they and their fragile little egos can go sit on a shit!
💩
I think @andrewPStreet summed it up quite well when he tweeted... Seriously: if your masculinity is THAT threatened by an ad that says we should be nicer, then you're doing masculinity wrong!
Boom! 💥

(Oh and I highly recommend checking out #gilette #gillette #gillettead for some seriously entertaining commentary on all the silliness! I’ll pop some of the best ones in my stories 😆)

Does the public have a right to be enraged over the new Gillette Ad? -Personally, I think the whole Gillette controversy proves how outdated society can be. This new commercial recently aired by Gillette shows multiple clips containing videos of young boys getting bullied/ bullying others. The ad then goes on to show clips of different people speaking about things such as the "Me Too" movement, Terry Crews speaking about how men need to be held accountable, and other things. Gillette has received numerous outraged customers complaining that, "The Ad was made for profit." and "It's trying to play a whole new perspective on what masculinity is." But in reality, is it a bad thing that this commercial makes men rethink what it means to be a man? Is it so bad that maybe, this commercial can teach young boys to stick up for themselves and others? If you're one of the people enraged towards this company for airing a good hearted commercial that teaches its viewers what a real man should look like, then you're part of the problem.

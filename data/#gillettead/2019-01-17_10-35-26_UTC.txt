If you are a man and find the #GilletteAd offensive the way I see it you misunderstood the point of the advert. If all you see is an attack on all men then you have missed all the positive examples of men that the advert shows and have identified with the negative examples - because that is who you are. Maybe instead of ranting and throwing your razor in the toilet you should try and be better person. 
Also - I am completely aware that Gillette in all likelihood don't give a shit about the issues raised in the ad and are only doing it to make money. This doesn't mean what it's saying is any less true

“Boys will be boys” isn’t it time we stopped excusing bad behaviour? Bravo to Gillette for taking a stand with their “TheBestMenCanBe” advert. This is how you use your brand, Gillette being aware of mostly having a male audience and using their influence as a global brand to make a change for the better! Brilliant concept with so many layers. A positive message to the next generation of men.  #gillettead

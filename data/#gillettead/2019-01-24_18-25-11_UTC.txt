In light of the recent buzz over the @gillette ad (have you seen it?), we’d like to do a #ThrowBackThursday. Our Fall 2011 exhibition, titled “Manhood: Masculinity, Male identity, and Culture,” featured artists who sought to explore, challenge, critique, and celebrate both traditional and nontraditional ideas of what it means to be a man. Among them was photographer Jesse Burke (@jesse_burke), whose work from the series, “Intertidal,” is pictured here. He makes the following claim in his statement: “The idea of masculinity is so incredibly fragile, so sought after and lusted for, because of what it stands for, because of the history of men. There is a delicate balance that exists between the heroic idea of masculinity and the true reality of men. My work is an autobiographically driven investigation into presence of vulnerability and sensitivity that acts as forces against this mythology of male dominance and strength.” We’re grateful that we were able to act as a venue for artists to participate in the conversation all the way back in 2011--let’s continue the conversation.

Sooo... @gillette launched their new #ad yesterday and to this exact moment the video has 305k dislikes on #youtube. I’ve also red some pretty mean comments about how a shaving product company should mind their shave business... As a #marketer, as a person and at least but not last as a #woman, I am speechless! I can’t imagine how people can actually get offended by an #ad telling you not to be a dropkick?! I mean it, guys seriously??? This is an #ad with a pretty simple social message - do not harass woman, do not bully other men, give a good example to your sons. If this makes you mad or offends you, maybe you’re part of the problem! #boyswillbeboys is a perfect excuse only for those who can’t be men. 😉
@gillette you have my personal admirations for this exact #ad. I haven’t seen something like this for a long time and guys you really should be proud! 👏

What are your thoughts on the #GilletteAd ?

I personally thought it could've been done a lot better... I get what they're trying to do, they had great intentions but the execution wasn't good in my opinion (Judging by the negative feedback and the amount of dislikes, a lot of people feel the same way I do). It's gonna be a no for me dawg. 
Don't get it twisted, I'm still buying their products, just like I'm still going to listen to R. Kelly, I'm still going to watch PewDiePie and still visit certain restaurants etc... I learned a long time ago to separate the art from the artist.. or the product from it's owners... If I started boycotting every company for making dumb decisions, I would honestly stop buying almost everything and go live out my life on some secluded island or something lol

But hey... That's just how I live my life, to each it's own üëçüèΩ

GILLETTE::: 👨🏾👨🏼👨🏻✂️
This Gillette Ad that tackles the subject of Toxic Masculinity has gotten social media talking & divided? 
The ad has received both praises and criticisms since it's been published, we find it surprising that anyone has a problem with it- this ad simply says 'don't be a jerk, don't raise a jerk and call out jerks' how difficult is that we wonder 🤷🏼‍♀️Btw, very creative ad @gillette 👍🙌🏾👏

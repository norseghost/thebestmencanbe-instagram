If you haven’t seen the controversial ad, we’ve posted the link in the Bio.

For me, it brought up a feeling of pride and happiness that a brand was so cleverly able and conscious enough to speak up.

However it received more hate and outcries of rage from men online than I would have expected.

So my partner Jenn and I decided to tackle the controversial subject of challenging our audience to do better and be better as well.

That will be this weeks theme. I hope you enjoy it!

With Love,
Christopher Isaac

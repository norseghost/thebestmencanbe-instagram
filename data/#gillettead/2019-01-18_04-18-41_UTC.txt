I haven’t been doing any painting lately. Life decided to take a curve and painting has been the last thing on my mind. The world is all so negative lately, and people are all so shitty, thank god for companies like this. But honestly, the way people have reacted to the Gillette ad is just super depressing. If you’ve felt offended over the suggestion at working on not being a shitty person, then you are a shitty person. #thankyougillette #gillette #gillettead #toxicmasculinity #toxicpeople #itsnotjustmen #womencanbeshitty #peopleareshitty #dontbeajerk

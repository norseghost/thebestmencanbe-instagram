Why are some men's egos so fragile that they would find offense in an ad who's message essentially is "Don't be an asshole and have some fucking respect!" This ad doesn't attack all men or masculinity, it attacks the toxic masculinity that has been allowed for far too long. If you want to be a neanderthal, then by all means boycott @Gillette, they don't need you or your bullshit. I am glad this has been addressed and see nothing wrong with the ad. #timesup #evolveorgtfo #quitbeinganeanderthal #growthefuckup #mendontrulethefuckingworld #dontbeadick #gillettead #gillette #menCANdobetter

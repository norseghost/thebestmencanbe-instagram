The Shinedown cover of this song has been on repeat on my playlist for the last few days.  When I’m sitting in my cubicle or on my commute I imagine a flow while this plays.  It reminds me of my paternal grandfather, my Papa, for whom my second son was named after. He helped raised my sister, brother and I to be strong and independent.  I still remember him beaming with pride with each achievement we shared with him.  I think of the messages in media of how we are raising our children.  As a mother to three boys I constantly check my inner dialogue -“would I be any different with a girl.” I hope the answer would be no.  I am raising strong men that lift others up and that are humbled by the privilege afforded to them.  #gillettead #momofboys

I will need someone to explain why people have a problem with this.  Sure, women can suck too [I can be a terrible one myself ðŸ˜‚] but toxic masculinity/behavior is a problem. THATS WHY THEY CALL IT TOXIC. What do you think?  Am I wrong? I think we all can strive to be better. ðŸ¤” #gillette #gillettead

Every woman I know has a #metoo story. 
If you are not like the men they portray in the ad, why do you feel attacked???ï»¿
I am shocked at the controversy, I can see clearly that men boycotting Gillette only reveals that they want things just the way they are. Holding other men accountable!?!? NOWAY!! Etc.. etc... I wish they had touch exposing their reasons, it is so obvious it hurts a little.
THE WORLD NEEDS TO CHANGE, PEOPLE!! Holding other men accountable!?YESS!!
And let's see if we can turn this men's world into a world for ALL:. ðŸ”¥

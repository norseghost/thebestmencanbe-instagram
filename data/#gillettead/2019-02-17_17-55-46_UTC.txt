with most issues, I see both sides. however, I’m more inclined to side with Gillette and the whole toxic masculinity thing. obviously not all guys are like that and I don’t think Gillette was trying to say that all guys are. they were just showing an exaggerated example of how a lot of guys act and have acted for centuries. of course you see it in that commercial a lot more than you do in real life, but frankly, the people complaining about the ad aren’t the people who would be exposed to people like that. the people who would see this type of toxic masculinity in their life would be women in the music industry, film industry, modeling industry, and a lot of other industries where they have to prove their worth. now of course, in our society today there’s a lot more respect for women in power and situations where women aren’t able to truly apply themselves are a lot less abundant. that doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen though. on the other hand, I understand how a lot of men can feel attacked by this but honestly I see it as a kind of playful take on a serious issue so I feel like it’s kind of immature to get upset about it. but I do hate the whole “men are scum” ideal, but that’s an extreme belief that not many people truly hold. so yes, I think toxic masculinity is real and I think it’s a lot harder for women to get far in life, but it’s not impossible or even nearly as hard as it used to be. comment your opinion. -Sam

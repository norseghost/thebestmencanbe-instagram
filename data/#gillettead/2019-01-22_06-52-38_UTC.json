                        "text": "Exactly. Decency and honor are incompatible with toxic masculinity. Personally, I loved the Gillette ad. Conservative outrage over the ad really shows their true colors when it comes to how they see the world. I hate that this needs to be explained, but if it must then we'll just keep on explaining it. Being a man or just being a decent person means leaving all of these unhealthy and antiquated ideas about masculinity in the past. Nothing a man does ever simply entitles him to sexual favors from anyone, partner or otherwise. It doesn't matter if you feel you were led on, and it doesn't matter if you did her a million favors. No means no. If you think being nice to someone entitles you to sex then you are the worst kind of human trash. Boys fighting and bullying should never be boiled down to \"boys will be boys.\" Fights happen, and there will always be justifications for violence, but defending the violent actions of kids by using the strange idea that boys are somehow supposed to be violent is disgusting. Boys need to be taught that violence is only always ever a last resort. It cannot be the norm. You can't teach children that acting violently is okay or that hurting people is an acceptable way to express yourself. Bullying cannot be tolerated. There is no honor in it. If you teach your kids to be bullies then you have no honor or decency. Men need to hold men accountable. How can we hope for a better future for our kids when grown men act like walking excrement? We need collectively be better. \nPhoto credit: @vikingwanderer \n#mencandobetter #toxicmasculinity #wecandobetter #gillettead #gillette #gilletteadvert #menwillbeheldaccountable #holdmenaccountable #menholdmenaccountable #redefinemasculinity #feminism #feminist #truth #facts #true #fact #boyswillnotbeboys #boyswillbefeminists #redefiningmasculinity #boyswillbeheldaccountablefortheiractions #boyswillbeheldaccountable"

As somebody who does not watch TV and uses adblocker, I don't really see a lot of commercials. But it was impossible to escape Gillette's recent powerful ad. Coincidentally I needed a new razor and made sure that it was Gillette.

The ad speaks the truth - toxic masculinity is a problem. Men need to be better men to each other, to women, and to the planet as a whole. It's a tiny symbolic thing to pick one razor over another and it does little for the growing up men have to do collectively. But, regardless, I'm looking forward on using this on my face.

YES @gillette YES. The whole world is talking about you. 
Changing a 30 year old tagline to “the best a man can be” is a real bold move for any brand. I loved the intent of their new oh so very controversial ad people be hatin on. If you really thought that gillette was trying to shit on their main consumer, their source of moooola, boi you trippin. Why would they be anti-male?? To sell less? 
The ad spoke about how we’ve changed, both genders, aaall genders, humanity as a whole. 
Its defos a long ad that didnt give as smooth of a shave, but i loved it. Plucking out one bad ingrown hair at a time. Be bald yall. I mean bold. #anditalic #gillettead #advertising

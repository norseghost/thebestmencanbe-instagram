When we were not looking, @gillette dropped a thought provoking ad. There has been so much debate surrounding the "The Best Men Can Be" ad which followed the narrative of calling men to be better in a world of toxic masculinity. .

Some people have applauded this empathic ad from Gillette, while others are PISSED, saying it is an attack on masculinity.

We think it's great in terms of furthering conversations around these issues, what are your thoughts? Yay or Naah? .

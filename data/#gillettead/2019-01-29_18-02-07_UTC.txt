RAZOR BLADE  Forget you and forget the lines. Wouldn’t everything just be fine?
Anger from a commercial is linked with critics denial.
What offends you will end the love. What offends you may just be part of what you have yet to confront.
I’ve torn out my guts just to see my stomach.
I’ve made an ass of myself in public.
Doesn’t mean I didn’t overcome it.
Understand, ask, and touch a base we can all stand on.
It’s okay to be wrong it really is okay to be wrong.  As long as you take notes and want us ALL to make it.  America is a big drum and the resonance is louder than what YOU think.

I’m a few weeks behind, but I’m still seeing things. Some of these posts about the Covington boys and the Gillette commercial are just trying to divide us. I definitely don’t side with Covington and I loved that commercial. If you have an opposing opinion let’s talk it out and see where it takes us.
Big love everyone.

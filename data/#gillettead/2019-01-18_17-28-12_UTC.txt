I think we can all agree that if you feel an advert denouncing behaving like a dick is targeting you personally, you should perhaps reassess the way you travel through this world. Or consider not behaving like a dick.

I saw a man call it “crass” on a friend’s facebook wall, in a delightful piece of supercilious grandstanding (using all my longest words today). I imagine that will be the wanton barbecue imagery.

Most of these guys are only angry because they know a woman made the ad, & are delighted to have an excuse to be outraged at being An Oppressed Gender (that’s not how it works). Like, chill guys, watch some of the ALMOST ALL OF THEM sanitary product/deodorant/make up ads created and directed by men.

Seeing big companies like @gillette decide that there’s money in promoting this kind of message is really interesting, and a promising swing. Hopefully it’ll continue beyond just being a fashionable statement. 
A little light in dark times.

‘There is no greater gift for our world than for men to be in their benevolent, awakened power.’ - Gillian Pothier

After the debate triggered by the Gillette ad, this weekend's #ElectricSpark is ‘Unhidden’, a new book by @Robert.Kandell which powerfully explores and redefines what it means to be a man in today’s world. It navigates the roles, stereotypes, assumptions and the masks men wear. And it's filled with powerful, vulnerable stories, exercises and practices. 
Rob is a good friend of Nikki’s and an expert in men’s personal development having spent many years as a coach. 
We love this book - thank you Rob!

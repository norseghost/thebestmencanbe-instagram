This week Gillette released advert, "Believe," as a part of a new campaign..👨 The company, known for their slogan, "The Best a Man Can Get," is tackling issues with toxic masculinity, aggressive male behaviour and sexist attitudes. 
Adapting their well known slogan, Gillette asked, "Is this the best a man can get?" The campaign has been produced in support of the latest metoo movement but this has resulted in negative backlash with the latest campaign being called "feminist propaganda.." Many have been left overjoyed with Gillette's powerful advert but many males (Piers Morgan included) have been left angered and have vowed to boycott the brand..❌ Was this a bold move from Gillette? Should people be angry? Do Gillette need to apologise? What are your thoughts?💭 #gillettead#metoo#prgirls#cardiff#riverandbear#marketing#pr#publicrelations#eventsmanagement#advertising

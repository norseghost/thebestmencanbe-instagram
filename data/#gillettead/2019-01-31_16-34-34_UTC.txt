“They can’t control an urge to be the antithesis of a decent human being? Are you really exempting men from basic human decency because they have more testosterone in their bodies than women? Are you really holding men to a lower morality standard because they supposedly have a more intense sex drive than women? Do you really think that a man’s increased libido — and a woman’s outfit (even though it has been proven time and time again that men who rape will rape anything with a vagina, regardless of clothing) — is an excuse to violate someone in the most vile, despicable, inhumane, aggressive, and demeaning way?”
.
“Perhaps it’s not about a lack of control but a REFUSAL to control themselves because they’ve been enabled by a society that dismisses rape and pins it on the victims’ shoulders because “women should know better than to wear seductive clothing around men” or “women should know better than to walk alone” or “little girls should know better than to be alone with a grown man, even if that man is a dad, step-dad, teacher, babysitter, pastor, family member, etc. who they trust” or “women should know better than to go into their boss’s office alone” or “that’s just what men do” or “boys will be boys.”

We were shocked by how many men were angry at Gillette commercial which challenges TOXIC Masculinity. It is unfathomable that some people don’t understand how to treat other humans. There is nothing wrong with being masculine but there is something wrong when your masculinity is used to intentionally hurt another human being. Thank you Gillette for highlighting this issue and using this advert to exemplify how men can be better.

What do the "men of tomorrow" think? ðŸ§  Last month, #Gillette shared a controversial new campaign that didn't feature a single razor. Instead, the ad calls on men to put an end to catcalling, roughhousing, and other harmful behaviours that are often excused because â€” as men in the ad say â€” "boys will be boys." CBC Kids News talked to five boys to see what they thought of the campaign. Check back later today to see what they had to say!  #boyswillbeboys #gillettecampaign #gillettead #gilletttecommercail #thebestamancanget #toxicmasculinity #metoo #catcalling #masculinity #feminism #gender #femininity #kidsreact #boysoftoday #menoftomorrow #genderroles #gilette #razor #shave #forkids #cbckidsnews #kidsnews #cbcnews #cbckids #cbc #parents

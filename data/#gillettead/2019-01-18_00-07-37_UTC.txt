Bette knows what’s up. (Sidenote: there is NOTHING wrong with wearing makeup, wearing heels, etc. I enjoy those things- well minus the heels, let’s be real. I’m all for you doing whatever makes you happy and feel like the gem that you are...We are all complicit in the beauty industrial complex. But there are also profound consequences to being constantly bombarded with cultural messages about how to look, how to dress, how to behave Day in and day out, who’s allowed to wear what, what we should and shouldn’t be exposing. How we are allowed to move our bodies and how much space we are told we can take up.) ALSO- the backlash to this ad highlights how far we have yet to go in the advocacy and prevention of sexual assault and harassment in this country. Let’s get to work! 💪🏼

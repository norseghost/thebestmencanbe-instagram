The American Psychological Association (APA) has issued new "Guidelines for the Psychological Practice with Boys and Men" suggesting that the way society defines masculinity may not be the healthiest thing for our boys and men.
. 
As much as this "toxic" version of masculinity hurts women, it also hurts men. It puts pressure on men to hide or ignore their emotions and conform to the societal standard or be labelled as "weak" or a "sissy." Changing the way we view masculinity might be better not only for women, but for men as well ðŸ’œ

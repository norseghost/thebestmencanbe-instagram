So who’s seen the #Gillette advert? The one expressing what real men behave like, in terms of respecting women, encouraging their peers to respect women and raise their own young males to grow into men that respect women? It seems to have caused a stir for some reason. If you’re a man and think it’s OK to harass women and treat them as an inferior sex because you have a penis, well you are a penis! I want my son to grow up thinking nothing but all people are people despite gender, race and all the rest of it. Well done @gilletteuk for using your platform to spread a positive message 🙌🏻

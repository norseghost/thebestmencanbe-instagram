There's a societal belief that teaches boys that the only emotion theyâ€™re allowed to feel and show to prove masculinity is anger. 
And that when he is crying, he is acting like a 'girl'. I've seen people around me who feel its a girly attitude to show emotions. 
Be a man is interpreted as show anger. Don't be soft. 
Then men grow up like programmed robots and they become very good it.

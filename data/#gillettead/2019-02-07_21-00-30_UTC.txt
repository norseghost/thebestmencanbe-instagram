[NEW PODCAST] Three weeks ago I had a conversation with Luke Gifford (@themasterheart) about masculinity and the emotional life of men that changed my life. When Luke said to me, "What if you spent an entire year learning to love yourself?" something in my heart erupted. If you've tuned in to any of my morning meditations recently, they're all fruit of this conversation. We discuss helping men become aware of their emotions, mastering their fear and anger, moving beyond toxic masculinity and raising kids who’ll face their monsters, tame them, and ride them. And yes, of course, we talked about the Gillette Ad too. If you skip everything else I do, don't skip this one. You can listen on every major podcast platform, as well as my site. [LINK IN BIO]⠀

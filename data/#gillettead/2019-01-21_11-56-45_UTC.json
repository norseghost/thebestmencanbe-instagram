                        "text": "A close shave? (Just couldn\u2019t stand by, so #metoo)\nShaving company Gillette has recently launched its new controversial ad campaign which immediately became extensively lauded along with getting severe backlash. Among the objections there are claims that the commercial teaches boys to be cowards and pussies, alleging that there is nothing morally wrong about catcalling, or portrays most men as dangerous perpetrators, harassers and bullies forcing them to feel ashamed of their masculinity. It even comes down to the arguments that males are just helpless victims of demonic and vicious femininity. \nLet\u2019s just do a simple exercise. Think for a moment and list the things a woman should do not to get raped.\n.\n.\nTake your time.\n.\n. \nI\u2019m sure in about five minutes you can come up with the list of at least ten bullet points, among which you will definitely find something like not wearing revealing clothes, not walking alone at night, not drinking too much alcohol at parties, not walking into lifts with strangers and the list can go on. .\n.\nNow think what a man should do not to get raped.\n.\n.\nShare your ideas, if you like. I\u2019ve got only one.\n.\n. \nExploring social dynamics and hierarchy boys learn to man up, to suck it up and brush it off. Boys don\u2019t cry. Boys will be boys. Or will they? The thing is that being a man comes with extra measure of power and the question comes up what to do with that power, either to be violent and sexist, policing each other not to be girlish, or to stand up for somebody who has less power, to be compassionate, to be respectful towards other people\u2019s feelings and desires (or their absence). #gillette #gillettead #gillettecommercial #masculinity #metoo #notaskingforit #blue #staircase"

To anyone reading this (especially male)...if you don't know what the campaign is about this post will probably offend you. Don't let it. The ad is not meant to target masculinity, but rather TOXIC masculinity (ie men who are aggressive towards women, men who objectify women, men who condone excessive violence, etc). It's intent is not to belittle men. But to hold men accountable for their actions and make us all think as a society. Just because you're taught that fighting or cat calling women etc is ok, doesn't mean it is. Be a free thinker and retrain your mind. Masculinity is a very sexy and powerful thing. But like anything, in excess, it becomes unattractive.  As a woman I can tell you is IS very uncomfortable to be looked up and down or cat called. It's awkward and upsetting. Yet we raise our boys to think they have to be this way to fit in. Nothing is sexier than when you see a man who has quiet confidence and is loyal and capable of showing some emotion alongside his strength. My Dad was what I consider a real man. He was very masculine in ways. He was a hunter and fixed cars and could throw down in a fight when he absolutely needed to. Etc. But he taught us to only fight as a last resort. He taught us compassion. We rescued so many animals I cant even begin to count. He wasn't afraid to cry when he would drop me off at the airport for school. He kind of personified that perfect blend of masculine strength and compassion and sensitivity. And let me tell you, he had the respect of the men in my hometown in spades. He was gentle and yet a so called man's man Rip Dad. And also the guy I'm currently dating sort of has that sexy blend of masculinity and sensitivity that I find so intoxicating. So to anyone reading this, it's not meant to degrade men.  I think we can all agree there are a lot of good, great men in this world. Watch the ad and you'll understand. It's making a powerful and beautiful statement. Men should be allowed to show emotions without being labeled "snowflakes" (in fact I find it so sexy when a guy can show emotions) and shouldn't be expected to fight and act like jerks.  Thankfully society is changing. #compassion

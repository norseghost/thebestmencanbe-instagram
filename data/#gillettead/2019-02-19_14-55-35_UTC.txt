Gillette changed the game, giving exposure to the idea of ‘boys will be boys’ being a crutch for society to make toxic masculinity acceptable. Showing that in the current political climate, it is not just the responsibility of women to stand up and call out such behaviour, but it’s also men’s responsibility to change and to also teach one another that being male isn’t an excuse or an affirmation to be violent, grope, catcall or sexually harass etc. Change takes more than just one gender.  #gillettead #thebestamancanget #toxicmasculinity

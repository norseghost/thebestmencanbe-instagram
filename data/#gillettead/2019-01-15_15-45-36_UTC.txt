‪Wow - shall we talk about EVERY SINGLE male propoganda ad there have been throughout history?? Ranging from the 50’s, where women were repeatedly told their place is ‘in the kitchen’ to now, where women are repeatedly told they have to feel bad about how they look so the MALE business owners can coin in. ‬

I’m not here for it huns!! What the ad does do, however is highlight the v real problem of #toxicmasculinity and it does it well. Encourage young boys to be better!!

If you're a male who is a good man and respectful to women ,girls,females of all walks of life..who was not only raised by a good man but are raising and teaching your boys to be good and prepare them to be good men in the future..If your friends and the men in your life are all good men then #gillette and the ad wasn't talking to/about you.

They were talking about those who aren't and surrounded by others who aren't. Those who tell a young boy to stop crying and man up. Those who harass and curse a woman out for not being interested in them.Those who feel they have to control an ex who is trying to live life and move on. Those who feel that showing emotions for a boy is like being a girl or if a woman is angry or emotional it gotta be that time of the month/pms-ing...I could spend all day on examples of who the ad was geared towards but if you're claiming to be a good guy/man and feeling upset and butt-hurt over it then maybe you're not all what you think you are. And maybe you need to do some soul searching to see why you're really pissed off at the commercial and announcing you're boycotting Gillette's products by filming yourself throwing away products you already spent money (I've never understood why ppl do that after and not before if you're going to boycott something ðŸ™„) on.

Gillette\u2019s ad is flaming hot garbage and here\u2019s why. \u201cMen\u201d as a whole, are not liable for the disgusting actions of the few. This ad is rife with the \u201c we are all responsible vibe\u201d. Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, and the like are psychopaths. Sexist collective shame/guilt is just not productive. It can only build resentment. It doesn\u2019t \u201chelp with awareness\u201d. The vast majority of men know and act accordingly in treating women with respect. If you\u2019re reading this and immediately have a vitriolic reaction with this statement 1. Get real and step outside the narrative 2. You probably have a personal problem with men\n\nAnd it seems that the media\u2019s answer is to make men aware of their \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d (with no mention of the opposite gender\u2019s shadow) and to tame \u201cmale aggression\u201d. It\u2019s to feminize men and make them more in touch with their emotions while ignoring true nature (not saying being in touch is a bad thing at all). The problem is not hyper-masculinity, but IMMATURE masculinity. It\u2019s the lack of true masculinity. It\u2019s the absence of STRONG men in kids\u2019 lives. 70% of prison inmates grew up in single parent households. \nAds like these are pointless. Sure, they get people talking so they do draw plenty of attention to the company which is all they\u2019re after in the first place (any publicity is... I guess..?) But do you really think that a razor ad is going to stop some sick moron from mistreating women? Or that it will convince someone not to in the first place? Come on, man.... \ud83e\udd14 It only creates division."

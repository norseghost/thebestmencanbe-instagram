Ok, so there has been a lot of debates about the Gillette ad recently. I would just like to share my opinion:
I like the ad. I know that''s an extremely unpopular opinion, but let me explain:
This ad was not against men. Many people misunderstood it and jumped straight to conclusions, saying it was sexist. How is it sexist? They were simply trying to say that they believe in the best in men. Some comments I've heard:
"Gillette was banned in my house."
"Horrible, sexist ad."
"Stupid feminists."
"You're acting like all men are evil."
I see where they're coming from, but there actually wasn't one time where they said anything sexist against men or boys.
Do you agree or am I completely misunderstanding the whole thing?
(Please be nice in the comments).

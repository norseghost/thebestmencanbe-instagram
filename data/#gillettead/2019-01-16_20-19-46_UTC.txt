This makes me so happy ❤️ The Gillette ad. If you haven’t watched it, do it. It isn’t saying masculinity is bad or that all men are evil. It’s more about if you are a man that fits the norm, let us that doesn’t fit know it’s ok.
.
It is about people thinking that you are weird if you don’t fulfil the masculine norm. 
That you are a girl (in a bad way) if you are sensitive. 
You are not a real man if your sexual prefs include men. 
You play with dolls, what the hell? 
Letting a boy hit another person because “yeah well, he’s a boy”. Oh god, I can’t be friends with a guy who doesn’t like sports. “He patted you on the butt because he likes you :)))”
.
The Gillette ad is about questioning the norm, that themselves have been a part of building. It’s about treating people equally, respect differences as gender and sexual preferences. Not sexualise women in inappropriate ways and not calling gays bad names. .
It’s basically about be a better you and let other men know they are behaving bad, if they are. If you are a man that fits the norm, let us that doesn’t fit know it’s ok.
.
If you don’t agree I recommend the book “Allt vi inte pratar om” by @idaostensson and @thorrutgersson. You can borrow it from me.

The video is on YouTube. Search for Gillette. It’s 1:48 long.

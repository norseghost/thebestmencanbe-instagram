Facing mixed and highly emotional reviews regarding a commercial that addresses “toxic masculinity,” men’s shaving brand Gillette has released a new razor specifically designed to cut off men’s testicles.
-
“We felt our initial efforts to address the problem of toxic masculinity, while well-intentioned, didn’t go far enough. It appears that merely addressing the issue through advertising was insufficient, so we decided to create a product that can physically excise the source of each man’s toxicity,” read a statement from the company. “The new model can quite literally shave away toxic masculinity, and will ensure that boys will no longer be boys.”

The Gillette Mach 7 Katana comes equipped with 7 diamond cut blades to ensure a smooth gelding, as well as a heating pad which automatically cauterizes the wound.
-
While many men agreed with Gillette’s message that bullying and harassment need to stop, some believe that castration of the entire male population is a step too far.
-
“Personally, I have never bullied or assaulted anybody. So I’m offended that Gillette thinks I should cut my balls off,” said longtime customer Rick Sullivan. “Really it’s just a small percentage of the population who give men a bad name. They’re the ones who need this product.”
-
At press time, efforts by the male leggings industry to address toxic masculinity fell on deaf ears, as the entire male population who wear them had already been castrated.

                        "text": "Marketing professor Mark Ritson puts it like this when it comes to the #GilletteAd: \nIn the two weeks before the campaign launch, 69 percent of Americans said they would consider purchasing products from Gillette. In the two days following the ad, that moved to 65 percent. \nThere has a been a lot of discussion about the Gillette ad in the last few days. My take on it was that it made sense to revitalise \"the best a man can get\" but that the execution was flawed. But new data from Glocalities shows that even the strategy is suspect. According to their data drawn from 5000 Gillette consumers across 14 countries these men are more likely to be part of the Achievers or Conservatives segments not the Challengers or Socializer segments more open to a critique of \"toxic masculinity\". And when you look at what societal issues stir Gillette consumers versus average consumers, gender equality lands dead last. Existing Gillette consumers are far less inspired by the message of the ad. Hence the negative responses on social media from Gillette users/former users and the generally positive comments from others. Again, for the hard of reading, this does not mean I endorse this lack of interest in gender equality. But it does mean that a significant proportion of Gillette's consumers think this way and P&G has (probably deliberately) opted to position on purpose rather than consumer perceptions.

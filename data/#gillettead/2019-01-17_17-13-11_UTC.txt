Yes. This is a real person. A self absorbed, privileged, conceded true, typical stereotype definition of a crybaby #Millenial #Liberal #NPC that uses #SocialMedia TO HATE USING SOCIAL MEDIA LOL. You were given every tool in life to live, but instead, you were given most likely a house to live in, a car to drive, & food to be a glutton. You cry about the health you're in while doing nothing to conquer an achievable goal. You argue without logical rebuttal, and place answers with your feelings instead. People like this make EXCUSES for EVERYTHING! And it's disgusting how this #Society lives by almost this exact creed. People like this are given way too many handouts, and not enough ass whippin's. #Poetic isn't it? And a shitty one at that. People like this prefer #Gillette razors, because it really is the best a "ma'am" can get. #TheVoicz #Streamer #Wolf #Twitch #TwitchTV #Trump #Lucybot #GilletteAd #Bot #Soygirl #Crybaby #CryMore #Facts #FactsDontCareAboutYourFeelings #StopBeingSensitive "Be careful what excuses you make in life. One day you're gonna find one you're gonna like." üê∫

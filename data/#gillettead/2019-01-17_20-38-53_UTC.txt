It’s clear that some men (don’t understand why) are triggered by the Gillette ad campaign, however, I think the media and corresponding rhetoric is a little overblown. What % of men do we think actually have a problem with it? 5%? 20%? 50%? In our social media age, it feels like the opinions of trolls and idiots are taking over the mainstream. Also, before brands push out messages asking people to do better, they need to look in the mirror. While Gillette is supporting #metoo, they also charge women more for the same products, aka Pink Tax. A little strange if you ask me #gillette #pinktax #gillettecommercial #gillettead #fakeoutrage #toxicmasculinity #branding #advertising #authenticity #nuance

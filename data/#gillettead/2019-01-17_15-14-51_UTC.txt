.
"Masculinity is toxic."
.
For the past few days, men have been reluctantly forced to go into defense mode against a cheap media ploy by a multinational corporation that could care less about the rights of either men or women.
.
Proctor & Gamble chose to risk alienating a vast amount of their core market to generate 15 minutes of pre-packaged controversy. .
There is nothing wrong with men choosing to stand up against an ad campaign that used them as pawns for the sake of publicity.
.
And to the ladies who support the ad and castigate men who disagree with it - remember that Gillette is not your friend and has been pissing on women's rights by way of the pink tax for many moons.

I have 3 boys, ages 14, 7 and 4 months. Today I showed them the #gillettead and we discussed the meaning of #toxicmasculinity. I simply asked them what this ad and those words mean to them, thier answer : don't bully, just because a girl is pretty or has nice body doesn't mean you have a right to bother her, to think about how a girl really feels and not how you think they feel, don't be a bad man, be a good man. They get it. It's not hard. Pass it on.

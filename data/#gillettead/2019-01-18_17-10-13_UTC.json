As a mother of boys I am PRAYING HARD FOR MY SONS. .\n\nFrom the moment we discovered a boy was forming in my womb we were taught the difference in their anatomy, hormones and growth expectency. .\n\nAs fully formed humans, I honestly was unprepared for how rambunctious and energetic these little men are. They can't sit still for long periods and favor learning by doing, rather than sitting and reading. One loves sports, the other loves art, another loves performing -they love all things! .\n\nAs they continue to grow I hope they love themselves, stand up to negative energy, respect all people and marry someone who honors their role in the partnership. .\n\nBecause there IS a difference between men and women. .\n\nWhen they diet alongside their wives, they WILL lose weight faster. When they have heavy boxes to move, they WILL have more muscle. When it's time to grow a family, one person WILL be responsible for carrying those babies. . ...and it won't be my sons. .\n\nGrowing up with an ambitious mother and disabled father will teach them many things. They will know they don't have to fit in a box. They don't have to be defined by what society tells them they should be (their mama didn't! LOL) They can BE anything BUT they can't DO everything. Respect how you and others were designed - because you are different. What matters most is you live a life of integrity, honor, faith, love and service. .\n\nI believe in our boys. .\n#gillettead #toxicmasculinity #ibelieveinourboys #momofboys"

We just finished Day Two at the Women Deliver conference in Vancouver. Starting with a conversation on how interventions with Very Young Adolescents can transform gender norms and looking at specific case studies, followed by a Plenary Session on the Power of the Present, opened by Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada. Trudeau announced Canada’s financial commitment of 1.4 billion$ annually for women’s #SHRH, maternal and newborn health. 
Crown Princess Mary of Denmark opened the day by speaking about the importance of collecting accurate data to further advancements in gender equality, “dreaming of a time when women and girls have choices, not chance”. We participated in thought provoking sessions about how to encourage men and boys to act and stand up for more #genderequality and also about the role of advertisers in dismantling gender stereotypes in the media.

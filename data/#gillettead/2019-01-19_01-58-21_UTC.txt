Recently, Gillette was praised by feminists for denouncing masculinity as toxic, for announcing that boys must not be boys. 
I think they were trying to increase sales of the women's products - the very ones feminism claimed as oppression, as part of the "Pink Tax". And feminists fell for it. They hated men so much they forgot all about their feud, and claimed they would buy so many products that the lost sales from men would not matter. 
Gotta say,  I can't see it happening!

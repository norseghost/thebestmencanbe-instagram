The @gillette ad (#GilletteAd) got the visuals wrong on male sexual aggressors. Presenting black men #whiteknighting the actions of white men to “protect women” tells a dangerous lie. Presenting a white man grabbing a black woman’s rear and laughing also very misleading and a lie when we become familiar with DOJ victimization survey data and look at the differences between races. Black men annually sexually assault less than 40,000 white women and less than 40,000 black women. White men sexually assault less than 50,000 white women and less than 10 black women. 40,000 to 10. 40,000:10 remember that ratio and know what dangerous lies are being presented to you with subconscious imagery in tv commercials. Also know the #GreyNewYork agency that created the Gillette Ad is pushing #Loxism also not a single mention of Harvey (could have dropped him in the new channel scenes).

I just went through a wave of emotions. Excitement and hope, then disappointment and disgust.

I was reading an article about the new Gillette commercial, The Best Men Can Be. After watching it for the first time, I was moved by the message, especially since it came from such a household brand. It is great seeing brands take a stand and start a conversation to try to help make positive change in the world. 
Then I read the backlash on Twitter. Men throwing their razors away, because the brand is challenging them to be better humans, to be better role models for their kids. I guess I wasn’t surprised, just more disappointed. It is a choice to be a bully. It is a choice to harass others. It is a choice to be an asshole.

If you’re threatened by a razor commercial asking you to be a better man, you don’t need a new razor - you need better standards.

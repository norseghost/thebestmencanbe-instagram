So I've just watched the new @gilletteuk advert. You know the one which tackles toxic masculinity head on? It resonated so much with me as it appesrs to have done with a lot of people. I know what you're thinking? He's not raising sons so how can he possibly comment. You're right, I'm not raising sons but I am raising daughters! I am raising daughters to believe in themselves and their own self worth. To believe the words 'I am strong' and to understand that it's not ok for men to harass women. That it's not ok to treat women to as inferior simply because they have a penis! While I can't pass on to a son the importance of equal rights, treating woman with respect and to challenge their peers to abide by the same ideals. What I can do is make sure my daughter's have a dad who models this behaviour. A dad who behaves rightly, compassionately, full of emotion and tenderness. Having a strong male role model who demonstrates the right kind of behaviour is the best way to carry on the mantle. I am so pleased that brands like Gillette are using their voice in such a positive way. We're all grateful.

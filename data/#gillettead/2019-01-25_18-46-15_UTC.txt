Who am I to comment on this issue? I’m just some 30 something yr old man... Gillette’s ad is flaming hot garbage and here’s why. “Men” as a whole, are not liable for the disgusting actions of the few. This ad is rife with the “ we are all responsible vibe”. Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, and the like are psychopaths. Sexist collective shame/guilt is just not productive. It can only build resentment. It doesn’t “help with awareness”. The vast majority of men know and act accordingly in treating women with respect. If you’re reading this and immediately have a vitriolic reaction with this statement 1. Get real and step outside the narrative 2. You probably have a personal problem with men

And it seems that the media’s answer is to make men aware of their “toxic masculinity” (with no mention of the opposite gender’s shadow) and to tame “male aggression”. It’s to feminize men and make them more in touch with their emotions while ignoring true nature (not saying being in touch is a bad thing at all). The problem is not hyper-masculinity, but IMMATURE masculinity. It’s the lack of true masculinity. It’s the absence of STRONG men in kids’ lives. 70% of prison inmates grew up in single parent households. 
Ads like these are pointless. Sure, they get people talking so they do draw plenty of attention to the company which is all they’re after in the first place (any publicity is... I guess..?) But do you really think that a razor ad is going to stop some sick moron from mistreating women? Or that it will convince someone not to in the first place? Come on, man.... 🤔 It only creates division.

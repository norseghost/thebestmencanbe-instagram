I\u2019m glad to see you once again fail to understand the meaning of intersectionality and your privilege... I\u2019m glad to see you once again fail to understand the meaning of multi variable studies and to see you make the same talking points... there was a great need for feminism until third wave feminism... this new breed of women like you and other condescending white liberal girls who think they know what\u2019s best for everyone are a much bigger problem then men doing the worst jobs no one else wants to do... Go back to your privileged life and act like you have a cause to fight for because you literally have nothing else to complain about and just need something to make you a victim so badly you will believe anything... You already called this country a shit stain and claimed all men do is rape and dominate and now attacked mothers raising kids lol... and yet you think men are the problem. Your liberal arts, gender studies degree is gonna do you well in life \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

Mariana, you said that the social tendency towards men having high level positions and women bearing the brunt on homemaking and child rearing is based in sexism. And I think that is wrong. You as a women do not get punished for pursuing a high level career and not having babies. It is your own decision to do what other people expect you to do. Though in Scandinavia, where the law is the most egalitarian law in the world, the differences in occupation between men and women became the biggest, which indicates that womens and mens interests are biologically based and that the Gender-roles at the workplace are NOT socially constructed. Your Argument is invalid. Also, women taking less shifts then men is not a sexist assumption, it is a statistic fact. According to the United States Department of Labor the number of women working parttime is close to twice as high as the number of men working parttime.

For you to say that men belonging in high level jobs and women belonging in their own jobs being based in biology is simply incorrect, 78% of female business owners in this study (https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/women-entrepreneurs-pay-gap-freshbooks-survey-28-percent-less-than-men.html) said they\u2019re happier working as a business owner than as an employee. women enjoy high level positions but many find it difficult to break into these fields because they\u2019re not taken as seriously as men, therefore, it comes back to more than just biology restricting women in the workforce.",

I said that more men than women have the personality traits that fit e.g. a Manager career and more women than men have the personality traits that fit e.g. nursing. That is not the same thing. Okay, women face difficulties breaking into some high level positions, i agree on that. What about men? They do not face the same difficulties? Don't they have to compete against others too? Don't they have to compete against others, mostly men, that made the pursuit of a high level career their main goal in live and are willing to work 70 hours or more a week for a high monthly income? Women and Men have to compete similarly to get to the top. And men, who compete will do everything to get an advantage, they are also more likely to use unfair ways and do things that will make others dislike them, they are usually not very agreeable. Women usually are agreeable, thats the biggest additional difficulty they face competing for a high end career. Encourage women to be disagreeable in the workplace when needed and they will more easily get to the top. But there is no one preventing women to get to the top because they are women - and if: go to court.",

The ONLY reason one gender makes more than the other is simply the amount of time they put in and the amount of business they bring and nothing more. Most females that work with us have a family and children thus they can not put in the hours men can because of taking care of their families, some women that are single and have no obligations make as much and sometimes even more than the men. It\u2019s that simple. So your comments are very true and correct.",

When this video came out I heard it caused quite a lot of stir that a lot of men were boycotting @gillette .
.
To say I was disappointed is just an understatement. .
.
It's rather unfortunate that a lot of men do not want to be held accountable for their actions. .
.
It's easy to call out women who want to sleep with men for money, but difficult to say you man who promotes such behaviour, take a look at yourself in the mirror and stop what you're doing. .
.
If the reaction from men, in general, is anything to go by, then, unfortunately, we have a long way to go. .
.
It means a lot of women are still at risk and are daily at the mercy of men who think they hold their future in their hands unless they sleep with them. .
.
My favourite part of the video was the boys will be boys part. We've given that silly excuse to justify stupid behaviour, but it's high time we stop justifying nonsense & hold everyone accountable for their actions. .
.
Take a look at yourself in the mirror, I hope you're happy with what you see.

Have a great week.

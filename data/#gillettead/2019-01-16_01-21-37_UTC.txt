Right now, while many of us are in networks debating whether the #GilletteAd is politically correct or not and its moral implications, the crypto market has remained on the edge, with Bitcoin (BTC) at $3,600 with a bearish trend.

Product of that trend, traders and investors have sought refuge taking their money from the market or passing everything to the Stablecoins. In fact, the Market Cap fell to $120,549,086,830 today, despite the volume traded in the last 24h $16,956,713,271. In fact, Bitcoin (BTC) continues to be the king of the market with a domain of 52.6%. As for the Altcoins market, much of the trading has moved towards some of these Tokens that appear in the Top 5 of the currencies that have grown the most in the last 24h: 1) WAX (WAX) $0.042440 +24.18%; 2) Aurora (AOA) $0.012123 +17.32%; 3) Stratis (STRAT) $1.03 +12.05%; 4) Chainlink (LINK) $0.538731 +11.76% and 5) Aeternity (AE) $0.405431 +9.12%. Now, this scenario clearly shows that a new downturn is coming perhaps below the level of +3,300, so for those who are not in HODL and are now doing Scalping, they should be on the market activity.

Good luck with Trading or HODL.ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜° #MarketDown #MarketCap #Bitcoin #BTC #Altcoins #Tokens #HODL #ScalpingTime

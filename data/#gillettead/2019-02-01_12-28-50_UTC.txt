Episode 145: Masculinity Goes Viral: The APA Guidelines, Gillette Ad & Boys of Covington High School

Maybe you’ve even heard about the American Psychological Association’s Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Boys and Men, which some applaud and some condemn. (Two recent headlines: “Toxic Masculinity is Under Attack. And That’s Fine,” from a left-leaning website, and “The American Psychological Association Has Made Choosing a Therapist Easy,” from a right-leaning site.) Discussion of these videos, pictures and guidelines have dominated social media recently — for better and for worse. For better: People are publicly discussing masculinity and the expectations placed on boys and men. For worse: Many people are jumping to conclusions without looking at the actual source material. In many corners, “discussion” has devolved into shouting.

In this episode, Jen & Janet dive in & discuss:

The APA Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Boys and Men

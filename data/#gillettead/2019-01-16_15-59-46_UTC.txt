Gillette’s marketing director was reached for comment: “We figured we may have originally been too obscure and abstract with our message, so hopefully the lyrics to this popular, classic song, plainly laying the message out, by everyone’s favourite musician, will help. Actually now that I’m thinking about it, ‘Better Man’ by Pearl Jam might have fit the targeted demographic better. Or, fuck it, ‘With Arms Wide Open’ by Creed or something. Shit.”

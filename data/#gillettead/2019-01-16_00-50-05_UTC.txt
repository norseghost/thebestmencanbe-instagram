Standing up for men?  Wow.  Refreshing.  I've been hearing a lot about Gillette's "Toxic Masculinity" commercial.  I've read some articles, read about it in different feeds, a couple of friends have even shared the commercial with me on whatsapp... Don't get me wrong, I've been a Gillette customer since puberty.  They've had good years with me. $$. Gillette, owned by the Procter & Gamble Company (originally founded in 1837 by British American William Procter and Irish AmericanJames Gamble) is a juggernaut.  A massive, massive, global giant.  Not a mom and pop shop.  This company that has it's virtual hands in media, nutrition, pharmaceutical industry, etc etc etc is owned by majority shareholders that are also majority shareholders in other juggernaut globally recognized companies.  The one world, global economic friends club... Often referred to by some as puppeteers.  It's probably fitting that the company joined the Western Society social engineering program that's been going on for a few years now.  Where men are made to feel guilty for being masculine and praised for being feminine... So probably not a surprise if you really think about it. 
What is important here is outlining how incredibly disrespectful, condescending, and demeaning it is to the male population.  I can't watch a movie, TV commercial, sitcom, read a newspaper, or listen to the radio without being groomed to feel a certain way.  The pressure is always on at such a level, you would think the globalists were afraid of losing a war. 
Men are not evil.  They are Brothers, Sons, Fathers, Teachers, Firefighters, Doctors, Partners... colleagues, helpers, the list doesn't end.  They are an equal part of our society.  Gillette's stocks will take a tumble.  They will lose one customer for sure.  Unless... #misandry #toxicmasculinity #toxicfemininity #gillettead #greatawakening #fakenews #feminism

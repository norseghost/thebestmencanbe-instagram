In this video I talk about my thoughts on the controversial Gillette ad recently shared as a short film from my perspective as a marketer. It was obviously a bad move on their part as many are now calling to boycott them for alienating and lecturing their biggest audience. Companies that sell toiletries and things you don't worry too much about shouldn't be pushing ideological and political agendas and for the first time men are actually considering what razor to buy.

Let me know what you think in the comments below!

Also I improved my photo for the thumbnail template ðŸ‘ŒðŸ“¸ #gillette #gillettead #news #controversy #toxicmasculinity

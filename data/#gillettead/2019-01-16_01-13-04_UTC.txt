I applaud Gillette for their ad campaign calling on men to hold ourselves and each other to a higher standard. To say no to bullying, sexual harassment, violence, and a form of masculinity that encourages these. Men, we can and must be better and doing so will make us better men than our society thinks we can be now. https://youtu.be/koPmuEyP3a0 #bettermen #bebetter #nomoreexcuses #endtoxicmasculinity #gillettead #gillette #wecanbebetter

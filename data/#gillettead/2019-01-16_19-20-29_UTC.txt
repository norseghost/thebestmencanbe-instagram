Men are getting their boxers in a twist over the #gillettead asking them to rethink if this is “the best a man can get” or if men can challenge themselves to be better. These men are indignant about being prompted to redefine masculinity so it’s less toxic. 
So let’s look at the social constructs and norms @gillette is asking men to rewrite: #bullying #mansplaining #physicalviolence #sexualharassment #streetharassment — the stuff that makes the lives of most women and men hell. 
By raging about how Gillette has “slammed masculinity”, essentially these men accept the masculine traits they strive towards are the above mentioned toxic patriarchal behaviours.
By slamming Gillette for being anti-men, these same men are acknowledging that the actions highlighted in the ad — fistfights, picking on the vulnerable, abusing women — are attributes of the type of masculinity they subscribe to. The kind which is killing us all.

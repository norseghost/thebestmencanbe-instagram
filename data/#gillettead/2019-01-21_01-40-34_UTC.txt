I watched the @gillette ad that everyone has been talking about lately. Many men are outraged, and getting very defensive. The #metoo movement, feminist movements and equality movements are doing better than they have before in 2019 and that's a huge plus.

But why are men becoming this defensive over the ad and why are they acting like their masculinity is being stripped away from them like Gillette has just released an ad about a new nut slicing razor. 
For a lot of men, their entire lives are built off of father expectation, peer expectation, societal norms and is all very superficial. So it doesn't surprise me when men in the masses become defensive over an ad.. their egos. Key word: EGO. Ego should have nothing to do with masculinity but unfortunately it does, it's called toxic masculinity. 
In no way did the ad attack masculinity, it attacked toxic masculinity. And man to man, if you were negatively impacted by this ad, I am not here to push you down in anyway, but to say I understand, I'm on your side and we have to work together in re-shaping what real masculinity means to the world in 2019 for everyone.

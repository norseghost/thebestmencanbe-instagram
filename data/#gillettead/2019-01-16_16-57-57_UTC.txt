Have you seen the new Gillette commercial? It’s fantastic. It sheds a light on the new role of men (and more importantly, fathers) in our modern society to combat issues such as de-valuing women, bullying and toxic masculinity.

Stepping back, I took a moment to evaluate my values, beliefs and stance on such sensitive subjects. Fortunately for me, I have both an amazing dad (thats you @bryan.norris12) and an even better Heavenly Father (Matthew 23:9) that have influenced my character and shaped me into the man and father I am today.

Gentlemen, dads, bros and boys: remember that your children, grandchildren, nephews, cousins and even that annoying kid down the street are watching you.
They are watching how you treat yourself and your wife. 
They are watching how you view women and minorities.
They are watching how you handle adversity and stress.
They are watching how you exhibit masculinity and grace
And most importantly, they are watching how you grow as a man because whether you realize it or not, they are are going to want to be just like you someday.

I have more awareness now than ever before of the ways in which I behave around my son paint a better picture of “manliness” than what the media often shows these days. Will you join me in doing the same?

Gillette's innovation branch debuted this heated razor for an Indiegogo campaign last year, and it was wildly popularâ€”probably because a razor that mimics the barbershop treatment without tacking on more blades sounds pretty nice. In less than a second, the razor heats up to 122 degrees, warming soap and skin for an upgraded shave. Heated Razors ($160 each) ordered during the Indiegogo campaign are set to start shipping in February, and Gillette announced at CES 2019 it would collect feedback and start working on a commercial version.

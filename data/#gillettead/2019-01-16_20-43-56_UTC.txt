The first #onwednesdayswe discuss of the year - and what better topic to pick than the controversy following the Gillette advert. From what Iâ€™ve seen, there are 2 dramatically different responses - some people loved it, others seemed to get offended. I think the advert did what it set it to do - spark debate (probably mainly to sell products) BUT also hopefully with the aim of making people think about how they define masculinity. Have you watched it? What did you think of it? -

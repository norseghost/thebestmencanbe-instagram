"Boys will be boys"

Till we don't hold them accountable for their actions, quietly accept the behaviour and caress the ego.
It is new for men to know, what is wrong with the 'high standards' of Masculinity but not late.
Men can be vulnerable.
Men can be emotional.
Men can be shy.
Men can be supportive.
Men can end toxic masculinity. "Boys will be what they are taught"
After all young boys are impressionable, so let's make an effort and be a role model that you hoped would stand by you forever.

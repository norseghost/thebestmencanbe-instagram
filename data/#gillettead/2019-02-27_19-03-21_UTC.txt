I started to see on my feed something about a Gillette commercial so I was like let’s see what’s the hype all about. So I watched the ad and it’s just another feminist piece of shit that tries to tell men that they are wrong for being a man. Feminists want men to be nice guys, but nice guys don’t get anywhere in life. If you want to boycott Gillette’s agenda, you must first know that other razor companies do similar man hater ads. But apparently, after the ton of negative feedback on the Gillette ad, they removed these ads and tweets. All razor corporations are in the same business: to make you a soft, weak, nice guy/boy. If you want to boycott Gillette, grow a beard.

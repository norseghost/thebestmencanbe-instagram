Razor-brand, Gillette's ad slamming toxic masculinity is tearing the internet apart. 
In the campaign which was tagged, "The best a man can get", the company showed images of bullying, sexual harassment, sexist behaviour and aggressive male behaviour and then examples of more positive behaviour like stepping into prevent these behaviours when they happen in public. 
The company says it wants to hold each other accountable. 
The video currently has more dislikes than likes on YouTube.

Imagine trying to start a conversation on the root cause of the #MeToo movement, that is, #ToxicMasculinity and you get hate from your target audience because they misunderstand and are prime examples of what is being talked about, then imagine they lose their mind and destroy their products😂😂🤷🏽‍♂️

There is no "emasculate men" agenda out there against #masculinity or men. Stop making shit up😪 Men just need to be held accountable for what they attribute to and the #rapeculture they perpetuate. We need to help eachother be better, men need to help other men be better. No one is perfect, we can all be better, but the focus here is toxic men, and if this hurts you, then maybe you should look in the mirror👀
- (While I don't support Gillette and I don't think you should buy their products, I still like when big companies start an important conversation that must be had!(Fu*k Nike too while I'm at it😂😂) -

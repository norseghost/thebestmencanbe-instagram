If anyone still wonders why so many men are outraged by the Gillette ad, here you go. Now imagine the media was constantly telling women and girls about the evils of women and telling them to be accountable for the psychos. Judging from the backlash against The Red Pill, March for Men, and due process, the same people praising Gillette and mocking the guys who are offended would probably would be rioting outside Gillette headquarters. #phenoMENalAct

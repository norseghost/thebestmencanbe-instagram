Recently, #Gillette released a controversial video ad called "#WeBelieve", which depicted young boys bullying each other and men sexually harassing women, calling upon men to watch men carefully. #FoxNews anchor #TomiLahren thinks releasing a man-bashing ad will do nothing to correct sick men doing sick things. Psychology professor from U of Toronto #JordanPeterson points out that #ToxicMasculinity comes from a pathological world view propagated by the #libtards -- the entire human history is a history of oppression of women by men.  #FoxNews Anchor #TuckerCarlson (2018) argues that one of the hidden agendas of global business tycoons advocating identity politics is to sell their products by brainwashing libtards into imagining that they are fighting the power by purchasing their products. #GilletteAd (by #ChapmanChen, #LocalPress, #HongKong)

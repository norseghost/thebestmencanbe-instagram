This comment was left on my stream from last night about Gillette’s new ad. While I don’t think this represents all or even most men, I can say from experience that this kinda thing isn’t isolated to only the incels either. 
This kind of thinking pops of frequently in religious communities and I’m sorry to say that once upon time I thought this way, though less intensely than this moron.

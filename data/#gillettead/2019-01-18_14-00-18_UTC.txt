MEN FIGHT THROUGH THE PAIN - Arushi Pachoree (@arushipachoree)

Most men I know
Never once popped a painkiller,
Because their virility doesn't negotiate,
Because the terms and conditions to their masculinity,
Don't account for the inability to endure
Trivial pain, once too often.

When men die, undiagnosed,
Of emotional trauma,
It is more a disgrace than a tragedy.
Because men don't die of inconveniences,
Men fight through the pain.

There are men I know,
Men whose skulls burst open
Every night,
And no one puts them back together in the morning.

Men who carry the weight of the world
On their broad shoulders,
When their necks threaten to snap
Under the weight of their own
heads.

Men who lose their lives
To clinical depression
Don't get much sympathy,
Even less medical attention,
Because they don't know when to ask for it.
Because you told them,
Men fight through the pain.

Men fight through the pain,
And it's a battle they are rigged to lose.

Because when they die,
And they will,
It's not on you, is it?

It's on the grit they are made to put on
Because grimaces shouldn't grace weather-beaten faces.
Because their ill health is a blemish,
And they owe the world spotless lives.
Because who will change the world,
If not for unfeeling, rational men,
Responsible for women
Whose fragility is all-inclusive?

You don't blame the lies you told them.
You don't blame the ideas
That you drilled inside their skulls.
You don't blame the times
You made him drink his tears
And suck on his own blood.
You don't blame the disease,
Because mental illness is just a fancy way
Of saying he wasn't strong enough.
You blame the man, too weak
To have surrendered,
To pain that could've killed
Half the world, all at once.

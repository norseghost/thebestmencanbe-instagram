Happy to support Gillette Deodorant who is doing big things to support our servicemembers, veterans, & their families. They are launching a program in partnership with @OperationHomefront. They help our service men and women thrive not just survive when they get back home. ================== Gillette will be running a “For Every 2 Sold, We Donate 1” program for their new Hydra Gels at select retailers throughout the summer.
Visit​ w​ ww.Gillette.com/MilitaryDonation​ ​to learn more about the campaign and watch Gillette’s new video​ ‘Every Hero Sweats, Some Never Show It’
The film showcases the lesser known challenges that servicemembers face when retiring or separating from the military and re-entering civilian life and finding a job. It’s important to celebrate the everyday heroes who persevere through that transition all while balancing the everyday demands of their job, family life, and any number of additional challenges they face.

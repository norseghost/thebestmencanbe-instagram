WE’RE BAAA-AACK!!! And coming at 2019 like Blippi in a ballpit. 🤪🤪🤪

Episode 15 is going live TOMORROW and we’re talking saga, scandal and controversy with @ubuntubaba , @woolworths_sa and @gillette. Our hearts also break a little as we discuss going #backtoschool and we think fondly back to December memories with the #benoni Monkey and Bird Park, @sandtoncitymall’s Nutcracker Circus and the @grinchmovie with @sterkinekor . .

The show is jam-packed, guys. Please tune in on Spotify, Apple Podcasts or SoundCloud (and don’t forget to leave a review!). Like, share, comment and show some love ❤️. .

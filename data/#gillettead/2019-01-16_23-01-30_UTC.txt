I watched the advert and saw nothing wrong with it. The message #gillettead was trying to pass was men should be better role models to the younger boys looking up to them and treat women better.. What's wrong with that?. Now I don't think all men are dickheads. There are some fantastic, amazing men out there. The only thing is they are the minority.the other percentage of men no offense are just ass holes.  The ad was for those group of men..... Shout out the the amazing men

In case you haven't seen it yet, this is the @GilletteUK ad that is currently provoking so much discussion, both negative and positive. 
My take? I think it's an emotive, timely and important ad. It tackles issues head-on but not in a way that is opportunistic; it's absolutely consistent and authentic with what Gillette has stood for for decades - encouraging men to aspire to a better version of masculinity. 
Gillette didn't create the issues the ad addresses but they are, nonetheless, prevalent in our society at the moment. What Gillette is doing, as a responsible brand, is encouraging change on a subject they have a right to talk up on. I applaud them.

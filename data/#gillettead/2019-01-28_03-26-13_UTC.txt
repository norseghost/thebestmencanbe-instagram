After our last post, we thought it was necessary to go a bit more in depth about what toxic masculinity is, in case not every one is aware. We've put together a really useful and diverse thread which gives a good idea of what it is and how it's different from just masculinity. We want to reiterate that masculinity is great, as you'll see in the posts, but toxic masculinity isn't. That's when we tell our boys that they "shouldn't cry" or need to "toughen up" so that when they grow up they will have issues with communicating their feelings or seeking help for mental illness in fear of their masculinity being questioned.
Feminism works to break down gender boundaries, meaning it includes the struggles of men, instead of rejecting it, which many ppl who are misinformed believe. Also, masculinity CAN be positive!! Positive masculinity is when we let men know they get to be whatever they want to be, even if it's not something a man would traditionally have done e.g nursing or other forms of care, or being emotional or gentle. To all men, even and especially those ridiculed for being "not manly", we see you. We value you. #toxicmasculinity #masculinity #positivemasculinity #gillettead

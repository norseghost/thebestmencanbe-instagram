Dr. #GadSaad is a Lebanese-Canadian evolutionary behavioural scientist at the John Molson School of Business @ #Concordia University who is known for applying evolutionary psychology to marketing and consumer behaviour. He holds the #ConcordiaUniversity Research Chair in Evolutionary Behavioural Sciences and #Darwinian Consumption and has a blog at #PsychologyToday titled #HomoConsumericus. One line of research that Saad has been exploring is how hormones affect consumers and the decisions they make. Examples of this research include how showy products affect testosterone levels, how testosterone levels affect various forms of risk-taking, and how hormones in the menstrual cycle affect buying decisions. Another line of research has involved gift giving, including how men and women differ in why they give. #üßê Saad also has a #YouTube series titled The Saad Truth in which he makes videos critiquing political correctness, the ideology of multiculturalism, #postmodernism, #thirdwavefeminism, the ideology of Islam, #safespaces and trigger warnings. üëâüèæ His recent critical observations have been directed towards the #gillette campaign focusing on the pathologizing of masculinity. Via #twitter, he has correctly stated the following; Dear @Gillette: Some men are violent #misogynists. Most are willing to die to protect our liberties and freedoms (including those of women). It is grotesque to repeatedly ascribe #collectiveguilt onto half of humanity known as men.  Being a man is not a disease nor a #pathology. üåê #thegadfather #nofear #virtuesignaling #toxicfeminism #sjwcringe #gillettead #thebestmencanbe #themetoomovement #metoomovement #superbowlad #superbowlads #superbowlads2018 #superbowl53 #superbowlads2019

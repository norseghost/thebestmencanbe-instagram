Hey guys
Here's #69 - sort of my take on the BACKLASH regarding the recent Gillette advertisement.

First of all - no one here hates men, or masculinity. This fight is very much against TOXIC masculinity, same way there's a fight against feminist extremists. (You know the ones - the ones screaming about how it's not ok that Santa is a man? Yeah, real feminists don't care about that kind of thing. We're busy caring about all the rapes and other injustices.) Furthermore - respecting people is not a political standpoint. Just because "politically correct" stemmed from the way politicians talk, (or used to talk, we've seen trump lately,) doesn't mean that respecting people is now a politics problem. The ONLY purpose of an advertisement by these companies is to get people's attention - and this did it. Good on them. Simple as that.

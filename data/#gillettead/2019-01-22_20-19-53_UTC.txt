#BoysWillBeBoys is a phrase I want to reclaim before it becomes as toxic as @gillette . We each, every one of us, carry masculine and feminine energy. Aaron can be a gentle giant my Lottie can be fierce! And how girlie or boyish they each are fluctuates. Yes gender is fluid. But what *is* toxic is when we harness feminine or masculine energy and exhibit it in its shadow form. Think of a coin. A coin has heads and tails so too do qualities. Aggression to chop a tree down might not be appropriate in another situation. Balance is key. Women don't bring the best a woman can get to the work place if we act like men to survive in a man's world (think internalised misogyny). If you find yourself wanting to act "masculine" for reasons other than just being yourself, it may have misogynistic roots.

It's when we are at our truest, sure and certain, channelling our masculine and feminine qualities in their most divine purest form that positive shifts occur.

Yes telling a sensitive boy to man up is not helpful but neither is preventing a boy from being a boy. Rough housing as academics call it, is a natural and required part of a boy's development and bystanders KNOW when it's playfighting. And children learn where the boundaries lie through this process. Watch the @gillette youtube video on 0.25 speed you'll see how the boys touch hands and the one on top is about to lift the other up before it cuts.

Boys also have bromances with their very best mates and sometimes they show affection through this rough and tumble.

Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water. Let boys be boys.ðŸ’™ The pics of Aaron are from 2014/2015. I have so much more to say on this subject but will save it for a blog post. #GilletteAd

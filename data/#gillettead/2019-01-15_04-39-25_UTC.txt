Gillette’s direction with their new and controversial ad is exactly the direction I’m headed in terms of redefining dating through SugarPunch.co 🍹. Women should no longer be expected to tolerate ANY kind of #abuse ANYWHERE, but in my neck of the woods, while #dating I’m hoping to see more of this line of thinking as we move through 2019. In the meantime, props to @gillette 💕💕💕 for taking a stand.

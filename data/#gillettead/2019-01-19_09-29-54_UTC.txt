On a grey Winter‚Äôs day in London, there can still be a ray of sunshine, and in the murky world of the internet there can still be amazing people trying to share important messages. Thank you to everyone who wrote such lovely, supportive comments on both my #10yearchallenge and #gillette advert posts this week - I know weight loss transformations and pro-feminism posts can spark some negative reactions, but it makes me happy to know there are positive people out there who support what I do. Like everyone, I have ups and downs with social media - supportive comments then trolling, being inspired then being sent dick pics, seeing a great workout I want to try then seeing someone promote a weight-loss tea.... but this week I saw way more good things than bad. Knowing that sharing my journey and experience helps even one person is the exact reason I set up this account, so to anyone who left me a supportive comment or DM this week, thank you. You guys (and memes about F45 and videos of cats) are the reason I do still have love for social media ‚ù§Ô∏è (And seriously if you‚Äôre not following @f45.memes what are you even doing?! ü§£) #wildcatfitnessuk #londonpersonaltrainer #londonblogger #socialmedia #londonphoto #girlssupportinggirls #empoweringwomen #weightlosstransformation #bodypositivity #gillettead

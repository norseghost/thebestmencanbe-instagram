I'm trying really hard not to be negative on my Instagram, but sometimes I just have to speak up. 
I just saw the new Gillette ad and realized that it had over 1.1m dislikes. If you haven't seen, go watch it now cuz it's one of the best ads I've ever seen.

This ad is about toxic masculinity, role models, bullying and sexual harassment. It's not about wanting men to be feminine and weak. It infuriates me that people still think that masculinity is about power, strength and patriarchy. That it's about manipulation, sexual harassment and abuse. It infuriates me that people still think about feminism as women who hates men and that they're mostly lesbians.

It makes me so sad that in this ad people see only this. When in the end of the day this ad is about being kind to each other, taking care of each other and about being a good role model to the new generation. 
I hope the day when people will start to see past their nose, but it's not gonna be today.

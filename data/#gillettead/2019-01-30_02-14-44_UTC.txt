I love a good AD. In fact, if it were up to me I would have the cheaper Hulu version with no ads, but my husband hates them so I have to get my commercial fix through websites like @adweek and @advertisingweek.

The #gillette ad from a few weeks ago, along with the backlash of (some) guys saying “don’t tell me what to do” made me cry from hope while watching... and cry from anger and shock while hearing some of the backlash from people that didn’t understand that it’s a pretty simple concept.

I have a son who we are trying to raise as a good human being. As a guy who will stand up to others when they are being bullies or toxic.

Like I said, it’s pretty simple – when you see someone picking on someone else - say something. Hold others accountable. Because right now we live in a world where some bad people are in charge. And we have to hold them accountable. 👊

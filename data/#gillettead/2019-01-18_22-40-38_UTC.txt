That's Jimmy Carpenter @jumpinjimmyflash and Nic Peterson-stocks. At the @bbcleicester Radio today on the Jimmy's afternoon show. We had a blast. I even got on my feet and had a little dance with Nic. Jimmy has tweeted the dance. Check it out on Twitter.
If you missed us, you can listen again here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p06w253d
You'll find the link on my bio.
Happy listening!

My eyebrows are non-existent in this. Also in other news, I wanted to talk about how everyone is freaking out about the new @gillette advert. .

I don't have a problem with the advert message itself, but the more I see about it the more I'm concerned about whether we're talking about the right things. .
My major arguement with it is.... I have yet to decide if it is good. Like, Gillette are you going to follow through? Or are you using this statement as fodder for your machine? Do you actually take this stance, or is it just you capitalizing on real life problems as a trend/buzzword. Cause you're calling out toxic masculinity while at the same time still using all the same business tactics and buzzwords on your products, while still having your razors separated by gender norms (and the "feminine" razors still being more expensive for less usefully product) and the feeling of your "masculine" product is still "real men use THIS" WHICH GOES in direct contrast to your advertisement. 
In short, words are meaningless without action taken on the COMPANY'S part to back it up. 
Step up your game @gillette

(#DearMenThankYou) - These are some of my daily products that help me feel good, both inside and out. ü•∞ @dermalogica @julepbeauty @sundayriley for glowing healthy skin. @givemethedirt @essentialoxygen @Schmidtsnaturals for clean natural health. @buxomcosmetics @urbandecaycosmetics for just a touch of makeup. And A new addition - #SmartlyRazors, a razor that I‚Äôm really excited to try for many reasons. It‚Äôs the same price for men and women! And because as much as self-care is important, it‚Äôs equally important to care about those who are different than you. I know some absolutely amazing men, and I want to thank you each and everyone for the positive influences they‚Äôve been on my life. They‚Äôve given me support, protection, love, and kindness. Thank you for your #PositiveMasculinity‚ù§Ô∏è #Equality #Love #GoldenRule #TreatOthersLikeYouWouldTreatYourself #StopSexism  #StopTheHate  #GilletteAd #ThinBlueLine #SupportOurVeterans #MyDadIsAmazing

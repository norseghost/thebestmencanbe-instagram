We weren’t expecting a shaving commercial to bring us to tears. Bravo @gillette for making a powerful (and unfortunately controversial) statement on toxic masculinity. This ad is worth two minutes of your time, especially if you’re a parent of boys. How we raise our kids today determines what is and isn’t acceptable tomorrow. Link in bio. #bebetter

Gillette has apparently struck a nerve with men across North America with their latest ad calling out toxic masculinity and displaying acts of non-toxic masculinity. The full advertisement on YouTube has over 800k dislikes compared to 400k likes and has been seen 16M times. Men are complaining that Gillette should stick to just selling shaving products and not getting involved in “politics”. Some are even going as far as to boycott all Proctor and Gamble products. What do you think?

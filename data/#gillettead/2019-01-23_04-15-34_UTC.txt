sorry for the bad quality on this post, but so important! the gillette ad never said, “all men,” it never said, “men are trash,” or anything like that. it simply referenced the toxic behavior and asked for a change. if you aren’t guilty of any of the behavior in the ad, and you stand up for women and tell other guys off when they treat women badly, then you don’t have anything to worry about and the ad isn’t targeted at you, you are already doing your part. but if you felt attacked by the ad, it’s probably because it hit too close to home.

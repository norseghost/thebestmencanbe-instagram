Also, quick history lesson for you: the overwhelming majority of African Americans (those of us who are descendants of African slaves in America as opposed to people of African descent whose ancestors were not taken to the U.S. during the slave trade or who immigrated over here from Africa) have European blood in us because of the rape that our ancestors endured. I’m 10000% sure slaves never wore revealing clothes, short skirts, lipstick or makeup, high heels, or tops that showed their cleavage. Yet they were raped incessantly by their slave owners. Why would they be raped if they weren’t “dressed like a slut” or as if they were “asking for it?” 🤔
.
Also, rape is most prevalent in countries in the Middle East, such as Afghanistan, where women are covered from head to toe and aren’t revealing an ounce of skin. And children are also victims of rape and sexual assault. According to RAINN, “one in 9 girls and 1 in 53 boys under the age of 18 experience sexual abuse or assault at the hands of an adult.”
It’s estimated that more than 50,000 children are sexually abused each year. So, please tell me again how women and their clothing choices are to blame for rape? I’ll wait.

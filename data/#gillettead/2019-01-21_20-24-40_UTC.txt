Dale spends twenty minutes explaining his literary masterpiece. Saying that men should be less shitty is apparently a really controversial statement to make, as we found out with the #GilletteAd backlash. We also discuss peeing on people, Dale's gout, #Trump's fast food photo op and pandering to the poors, competitive eating, shrimp forks, #MAGA hats, poor people breeding, slut shaming, sex vs Pokemon, how children impact mobility, and more. You aren't going to hear this shit on NPR!

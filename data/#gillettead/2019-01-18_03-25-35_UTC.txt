Alright, before anyone has a heart attack over an advertisement... because ya... people are freaking out over an advertisement. When i first saw the video i knew the reaction of it wouldnt be good, specially men would find it offensive. Rightfully so, it is taking the actions of some men and putting them on blast making it seem like this is most men. But lets take a lot at ads targeted towards women. Over sexualized. And thats what women deal with ALL THE TIME. But when Gillette was making this ad they knew what they were doing. Same with the Nike Kaepernick ad, they want a reaction, and taking a political stand works out for a lot of companies. They may lose hundreds of thousands of customers but theyre still gaining. In the average household, 70% of women do shopping. So when a mom or girlfriend sees this and is in support of it theyâ€™ll pick up Gillette. The message of the ad is strong but the way they did it was very negative and didnt represent men as well as i think it could of. I personally think this ad will help them. Because though the ad has double the dislikes people who are watching it and disliking it are angry and youre more likely to comment negative things than positive things. -

Also.. today at uni there were 70% of people that liked the ad and 30% that didnt out of a class of mostly equal females and males. So... take that for what you want.  #gillettestadium #thebestamancanget #gillette #gillettead #socialjustice #boyswillbeboys #toxicmasculinity

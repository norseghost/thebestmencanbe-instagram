Hey, #boycottgillette warriors. A quick reminder that the market is overwhelmingly female. And for all your threats of a boycott, I see your year-old neck beards. Not to mention, everybody in marketing (including Gillette,) knows that women make the majority of household purchases, which means razors for their own use and for the men in their lives. So, carry on with your twitter tantrums. Or …. you know, reevaluate your righteous anger and help redefine what masculinity means.

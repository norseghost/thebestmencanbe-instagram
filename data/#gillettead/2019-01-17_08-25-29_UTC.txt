#ToxicProgressives “Big corporations have HR departments that set policy for employee hiring, training, and education as well as indoctrination into corporate ‘culture.’ Yes, each company has a stated culture, which are all pretty much the same.

The HR departments tend to be populated by social justice activists and politically correct types. Their job is to make sure employees fall in line. This is achieved by fear. Companies will not tolerate racist, sexist, or otherwise intolerant behavior. Anyone caught telling an off-color joke by the water cooler could be fired. A male employee who compliments a female employee on her appearance could find himself in big trouble.

It’s all so much theater. Adult workers for the most part do not need to be drilled in common courtesy and how to treat others. It comes from within and pressuring people to learn stuff they’ve known since their school days seems silly.

Now global companies want to influence the behavior of their customers. Gillette came out with a commercial hectoring men for being too aggressive.

We need to tone down our toxic masculinity, we’re told. NIKE hired Colin Kapernick and subjected potential customers to lectures on race, political correctness, and virtue signaling. PayPal kicked off people who didn’t align well to their own political correctness. Patreon did the same thing.

This is not a good trend. We aren’t their employees—we’re customers and we have a choice. We need to stop patronizing companies who patronize and scold us with their unctuous, politically correct advertising.” (Ben Garrison)

#TrumpTuesday Be a man, be like Trump. What the left actually wants, is men to behave like real men. They don't want us looking at women like objects even though women pose as objects. So, it's just really stupid, we don't tell you girls how you should look at us, or talk about #toxicwomeninity 😂. This is one of the best advertisements ever, and @egardwatchco have sold out of 16 of there 40 watches which is insane!!!! Way to take advantage of the lefts stupidity!!!

Pardon the beeping! 
Here’s a clip of my take on the #Gillette ad. It’s a male brand challenging the men out there, to be better. And honestly I saw it as challenging all humans to be kind. Men and women. So many folks are taking it offensively which makes me realize... it’s truly an issue. Some of the comments bashing them are unfortunately telling. Please check out the whole video so it makes complete sense @ https://www.facebook.com/339552669972493/posts/346007329327027/  Pardon the beeping... #ranchwork happening in the background. #boltranch #workboots .

Thank You Gillette for choosing the hard right over easy... and safe silence. 
I felt the need to share with you all how this ad and the backlash it’s causing makes me feel. Some folks are taking it as an attack on all men. They are missing all the good men in the video and the clear message that we simply need to be good people and help others do the same. It’s not an attack on masculinity, it’s suggesting that everyone do something about toxic behavior they observe. They took a huge risk on this and may lose some sales, but you know what, it stokes my faith a little and helps me believe there’s still a chance of a positive shift. 
Pardon the back up beeps... the skid steer was working hard out my window. 
Here is the link to the Gillette ad if you haven’t seen it yet. It brought tears to my eyes. https://youtu.be/koPmuEyP3a0

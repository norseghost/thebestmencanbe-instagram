They stated on Facebook “We created First Shave to demonstrate that 'The Best a Man Can Get' includes all men. As a brand that holds respect and inclusivity as an important value, we have a responsibility to make sure we are embracing and promoting inclusive representations of gender. First Shave is part of our #MyBestSelf campaign and will be shown The Inside Out LGBT Film Festival in Toronto. We are also committing to ongoing monetary, product and volunteer support for The 519 – the space for change serving the LGBTQ2S community in Toronto. We kicked off our relationship with the 519 by making a donation in observance of Trans Day of Remembrance. Our support will continue throughout 2019 and beyond.” -

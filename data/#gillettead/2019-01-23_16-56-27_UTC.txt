Krystal is dropping more fire truth bombs in this open letter to the ‘Good Men’™️. 🙌🏼 Link in bio. 🙌🏼 "You may never be able to truly empathize, but you can listen and by doing that alone you make yourself a true ally. We don’t need help opening doors, using our brains, or paying our bills. We need you to listen. We need you to believe us." #goodmen #men #women #sexism #misogyny #notallmen #smashthepatriarchy #feminismisforeverybody #fuckthepatriarchy #destroythepatriarchy #mansplaining #toxicmasculinity #internalizedmisogyny #patriarchy #society #allies #equality #believewomen #metoo #gillette #gillettead #oppression #feminism #feminist #feminists #feministagenda #feministmagazine #juliejoplin #joplin

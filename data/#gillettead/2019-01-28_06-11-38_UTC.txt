Our response video to Gillette. Thank you everyone for watching our video. Over three million views. We stand behind this message and will continue to make positive messages.

Buy an Egard watch and support this company! The otherhalf doesn't need one but I am buying one anyway. That Gillette ad was disgusting as are those endeavouring to defend it. I feel so sorry for men in these times. Young men need positive reinforcement and role models not constant bullying and destablising and punishment for being born the 'wrong' gender Take a look at the full ad on YouTube.

An A. V. O. is an Apprehended Violence Order, or sometimes called a restraining order. They are usually carried out by law to protect victims of violence (domestic or not) or if someone is fearful for their safety. A friend I follow shared this pamphlet.  Of course in true P.C fashion here we have an image of people of diverse racial backgrounds on the cover, probably so as not to offend anyone... But they forgot to include a male gendered rep.  Maybe males only perpetrate violent acts but are never victims themselves... misandry #toxicmasculinity #toxicfemininity #gillettead #greatawakening #fakenews #feminism

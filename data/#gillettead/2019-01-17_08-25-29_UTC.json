Their job is to make sure employees fall in line. This is achieved by fear. Companies will not tolerate racist, sexist, or otherwise intolerant behavior. Anyone caught telling an off-color joke by the water cooler could be fired. A male employee who compliments a female employee on her appearance could find himself in big trouble.\n\nIt\u2019s all so much theater. Adult workers for the most part do not need to be drilled in common courtesy and how to treat others. It comes from within and pressuring people to learn stuff they\u2019ve known since their school days seems silly.\n\nNow global companies want to influence the behavior of their customers. Gillette came out with a commercial hectoring men for being too aggressive.\n\nWe need to tone down our toxic masculinity, we\u2019re told. NIKE hired Colin Kapernick and subjected potential customers to lectures on race, political correctness, and virtue signaling. PayPal kicked off people who didn\u2019t align well to their own political correctness. Patreon did the same thing.\n\nThis is not a good trend. We aren\u2019t their employees\u2014we\u2019re customers and we have a choice. We need to stop patronizing companies who patronize and scold us with their unctuous, politically correct advertising.\u201d (Ben Garrison)"

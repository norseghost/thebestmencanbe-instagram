Last one so leave a 🙏🏾 if you feel this and tag a friend:

“I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
 I know right now you can't tell
 But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
 A different side of me”

When struggling with mental illness or our darkness, we tend to hide our true feelings quite often. 
People think that we are just unhappy or unstable but we are just unwell.
_____
We want people to know that we are more than our illness, and that it is not our true personality. 
At times our darkness can overcome us so much that it seems to have completely enveloped us, and although you can’t tell, we are still there, it’s still us, despite all of this.
_____
We just want one person to stay, and get to know us, see beyond the darkness and mental illness and see us as a human worthy of understanding and unconditional love .
_____
In case no one told you today, you are loved and valued.

In your corner,
JB

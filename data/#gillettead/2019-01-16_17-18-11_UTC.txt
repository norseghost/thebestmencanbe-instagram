I feel some of you didn't even bother watching the ad or listening to it's message. Btw Women buy razors too thanks to a society that frowns at women having any kind of body hair and women pay more for their razors than men while the sales of men's razors is going down (bearded gangðŸ™„) so apart from a good social message, #Gillette is meeting the need of a growing section of its market (women). #thebestmencanbe

Saying "men we should help ourselves to become better people for ourselves and generations to come" doesn't mean "Don't drink beer, don't have sex, don't watch football, don't diss arsenal fans, don't compliment women, just wear skirt and high heels" So Calm Down!!!

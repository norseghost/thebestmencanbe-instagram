Have we all seen the "The Best a Man Can Be" Gillette ad? We don't know about you but it's blown our tiny minds.
.
The core ad, before looking at politics & morals, is a chronological MANtage (get it!) of bad men who undermine women's intelligence becoming good men who teach their daughters empowering values. And for the most part we love it!
.
...But does letting "boys be boys" mutate every male into the sexual predator that is Mr Masculine? And does teaching a boy to embrace affection transform him into the equality-promoting modern man?
.
We love the ideology & appreciate the brand ultimately had a job to do (& in less than 2 mins!), but even we call bullshit.
.
There's far more to good Vs bad &, quite simply, masculinity does not make - or break - the man. .
He seems sexist when you see him honk a female colleagues tatas but what we don't know is that he only works that job to keep a roof over his family's head while his wife persues her paid-in-peanuts fine art degree - is he still a bad man?
.
He seems the personification of the modern man when you see him stop a fight between kids but what we don't know is that he only did it because the underdog was his son who he walked out from years ago, having never paid a penny of child support - is he still a good man?
.
While we cringe at the offensively stereotypical examples used (soz!), what we really want to ask is that with the many ways in how society/life/men/masculinity/overpriced razors with huge PR budgets have changed over the years, ARE WE REALLY STILL IN 2019 JUDGING A BOOK BY IT'S COVER? Because, really, that's all of this is; deciding if his entire being is wrong/right based on lighting a BBQ or speaking up about sexual assault.
.
The fence is SO up our butt but this quote from Catriona Harvey-Jenner at Cosmo sums up our feeling towards Gillettegate (& our overall feeling towards humanity, for that matter!):
.
"Gillette's message isn't complicated, but it's fundamental for a positively evolving future. We just need to treat people as people; to exercise care and respect regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, shape, size, diet preference, left-handed-or-right handed,Â whatever".

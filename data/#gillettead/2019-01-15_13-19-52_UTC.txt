So Iv just read this, read the total crap some ‘men’ are throwing a paddy about. If you have a chance watch the video! 
Hats of to them, course they new some morons would start stomping their feet and saying ‘we aren’t buying you anymore’ .. yet they still took a stand. A stand to encourage better behaviour, to encourage more people to stand up for what is right! We have enough illnesses and natural disasters killing off off with out the evil stuff we are doing to each other. A stop needs to be made..an example needs to be set. So I say well done to @Gillette .. It’s 2019 it’s not ok to feel free to touch a woman because you want to, it’s not ok to bully someone because you feel like it, it’s not ok. I for one am trying my best to bring up my 3 boys to behave right, notice when someone needs help, not treat anyone in a way they shouldn’t. Can you imagine if we all worked together .. what a world we could live in? ___________________________

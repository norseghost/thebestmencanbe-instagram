I found meaning when I developed faith. // I love the outdoors and as I type this I am on my back deck listening to birds singing and I love it. // I exercise regularly. I run, lift and do a lot of body weight exercises. // I have hunted and fished and had a blast doing both. // I hike and backpack as much as I can. // Growing up I was into sports, especially baseball and basketball. // Since then, I am a football and basketball fan. The Golden State Warriors and Miami Dolphins to be exact. // I have a great family. My bride and I have been married for 25 years and we have a 23 yr old son and a 15 year old daughter. // I served in the Armed Forces as a mechanic on F/A- 18C aircraft onboard two different aircraft carriers. // I have a higher education degree. // I have a decent house and an awesome job. // Sorry there are a lot of I’s in this post but here’s the point. // Sadly, I have chased meaning from everything mentioned and ended up disappointed. // My identity, meaning and purpose comes from God and God alone. // Everything else has been the necessary tools and relationships to shape and equip me as a man but they don’t make me a man. // God made me a male and by His initiation and my willingness to submit to Him. He has given my life meaning as a godly man. // God has never disappointed me in my quest for masculinity or manhood. Never. // He has healed many self inflicted wounds or the wounds inflicted by others. // // I believe God wouldn’t disappoint you either. // This is who I am and this is why I am the man I am today. // @anewkindofman has been birthed out of my journey as a man. If I can help one man, it has been worth it. 👊🏼⚔️ #masculinity #menofcourage #menofvalor #mystory #veteran #navyvet #menofservanthood #menofrighteousness #bandofbrothers #leadership #dadblogger

Does this look like a "fair life" to you??? Open your eyes, this is the reality of ALL dairy farms!! Don't give me that "there's always a bad apple" bull shit!! It is ALL animal abuse if the goal is to profit from them!!
.
➡️Undercover investigators from Animal Recovery Mission (ARM) confirmed abuse virtually on a daily basis and that male #calves are in fact transported to #veal farms (Midwest Veal and Calf Start), despite the corporation's claims that it does not. .
The largest undercover #dairy investigation in history is being released with video evidence documenting systemic and illegal abuse at Fair Oaks Farms in #FairOaks, #Indiana. 🐄💔 #FairOaksFarms is one of the largest dairies in the U.S. and produces dairy products for the Fairlife milk brand - which is produced, marketed and distributed by the Coca-Cola Corporation.
.
 This footage was released about a week ago. This treatment is NOT out of our hands! When we purchase any dairy product we are funding this kind of treatment! Do your research, do better!!
.
Please watch and share this video. Please stop funding this industry! There are so many dairy free alternatives! 🌱

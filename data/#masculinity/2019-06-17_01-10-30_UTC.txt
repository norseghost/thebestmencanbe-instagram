A lot of men are scared to be gentle because they don't want to lose their masculinity.
.
Fortunately,  I was blessed with a lot of great father figures in my life who were tough when they needed to be, but also practiced being gentle as well. .
Thanks for my dad for always working hard to provide for our family. So many hours you put in and you didn't ask for anything for yourself. Thanks for letting me help you fix up the house on the weekends. .
Thank you to my Coach Horstmeyer,  who pushed me athletically and academically. You told us running and school was our job and we had to earn our scholarship. At the same time you always cheered for us and put a good word in to our future coaches and job prospects. .
Thank you Coach Weinhandl who was definitely gentle with us. Maybe more than you should have.  But you always believed in all of us and wanted the best for me.
.
Thank you to my father in law for accepting me into your family and always being welcoming.
.
Thank you to my husband for sacrificing your needs for your child and practicing what fatherhood really means. .
Finally, thanks to God our heavenly father for being a father to us all, and especially to those who don't have a father. You are the example that I see in each one of the father figure's I mentioned.

Happy Father’s Day Everyone! But especially to my father Martin! He taught me how to be analytical & logical, dig deeper, ask questions and feel comfortable going against the grain! He taught me early on that materialism is a dead end road. I wouldn’t be the person I am today without him. Me & my dad just had a dance party in the living room. 💃🏻 🕺
Go look at the moon tonight it’s full!

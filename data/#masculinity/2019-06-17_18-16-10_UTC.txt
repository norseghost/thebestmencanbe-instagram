Learning to reclaim my masculine energy has been the most challenging and important journey I've taken in my 27 years. It's an issue with today's young men that is taken way, way too lightly. We are hinted at from society that there is something wrong with us as men at our sexual core. Therefore we supress the greatest gift we have, which is to penetrate the world with love. So many men shy away from this because in the past it has come out in many negative ways, and we now believe it is toxic. Therefore we are lacking bold men who are not ashamed to go for what they want, to lead, set boundaries, face conflict, speak their truth and follow their desire in a beautiful respectful way. We need to learn how to balance our safety ( love, respect, compassion) and our danger ( boldness & desire to bend the world over )
When you were young riding a bike and building jumps, your mom told you to put a helmet on and rather play where it's safe. If your father were there, he would have probably told you to build the jump a bit higher. Your mom wants you to be safe. Your father wants you to feel your danger, your masculine edge. The problem is most of our fathers won't there. We have no male initation and no leadership. There's no point blaming anyone for this, but it's 100% our responsibility to reclaim it. Both my career and romantic life started to take a 180 degree turn when I made this a priority, and I know it's only the beginning.
If you don't get in touch with your masculine essence and learn how to express it in a healthy, grounded way, you will never live your truth or be fulfilled ðŸ’™ðŸ”¥ðŸŒ… #masculinity #liveyourtruth #spiritualgrowth #masculine #masculineedge #masculineenergy #love #respect #grounded #bold #freedom #fire #wildman #warriorenergy #kingwarriormagicianlover

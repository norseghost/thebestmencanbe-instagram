A very nice #hike celebrating #fathersday ... a big #shoutout to all of the positive male role models in our lives!! Grateful for all of the #men stepping up and showing my daughter what healthy #masculinity looks like. She may not have a #dad, but she has many #uncles #grandpas #brothers #cousins and  #friends who will give her the love that is needed to survive and thrive in this crazy world. ğŸ’™ğŸ’™ğŸ’™ğŸ’™ğŸ’ªâœ¨

Happy Father’s Day to the transmasculine people and trans men reinventing masculinity and passing it down to transmasculine and trans men earlier on the journey—to those who create safe spaces to exist and express.  Happy Father’s day to gay male couples who face discrimination.  Happy Father’s Day to all those figuring out how to father themselves with no template or example in place.  Happy Father’s Day to all who father in small or big moments.  Happy Father’s Day to men questioning what it means to be a man.  Happy Father’s Day to those who provide protection and care and acceptance of their children, metaphorical or literal.
And also...happy Father’s Day to both of my abusive fathers. Thank you for showing me exactly what and who not to be: and exactly who and what I AM.  Thank you for liberating me through intense pain.  Thank you for exploding my heart open, for my awakening. Thank you for allowing me to grow through all you did and did not teach me.  Thank you for really not loving me:  I love you.  Though we cannot speak, I wish you all the love and support and healing in the world.  I am doing all of this for you (and me, and your fathers, and their fathers, and also for all of those that I have and will father in my life.  I hope there will be many). Bless all fathers everywhere. 
Love,
Danny

To all fathers out there who are worthy of the title. Who don't get much appreciation, but nevertheless work tirelessly to give your children the best, to love your wife, to set the example. .

Protecting, providing, leading, loving. .

You are heroes, and society needs you more and more each day. Don't stop fighting the good fight. Though they may not say it, people see you and they try emulate you. .

Happy father's day.

Hi all, I know you guys are all wondering by now why I've been posting so many transgender related subjects to my story and why I'm so passionate and involved in it. I don't know if you all have picked up by now or even care about this topic but, this is my public coming out. I, Kris Arakelov, am a transgender man. It might be a shock to some of you or it may not. You may accept me, you may not. I am here to educate and inform people about the trans community and issues following it. I will hopefully be posting more later about myself and this topic, because this is something important to me. I want to make a difference in the world and be another voice. More to come.

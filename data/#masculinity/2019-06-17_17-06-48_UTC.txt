Toxic Masculinity refers to a negative and sometimes harmful attitude commonly associated with men, such as the need to repress or hide emotions during stressful situations and or to act in an aggressive and dominant way.

‘The new Age of Innocence’ is an investigation in to the vulnerability in masculinity. It’s aim is to highlight a man’s femininity and the relationship with his body in order to show a contrast of how other people perceive a shirtless man and how sensitive he actually is about himself.

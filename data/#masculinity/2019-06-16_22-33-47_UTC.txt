@buzzfeednews: Aaron Gouveia says his 5-year-old son, Sam, loves to get his nails done by his grandma, but came home in tears because he was bullied for his polish. Gouveia was heartsick over his son's pain and decided to share the story to speak out against toxic masculinity. “While we've empowered girls to do and be anything, the same doesn't hold true for boys," Gouveia said. He wants all parents to "allow our boys to experience their full range of emotions without fear or shame.” 👏 (📷: Aaron Gouveia)

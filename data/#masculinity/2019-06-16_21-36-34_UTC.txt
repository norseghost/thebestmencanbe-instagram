I celebrate all the men in my life who have and continue to enrich my life. In this photo my father is at the head of the table. I also think of the many who have hurtful relationships with their fathers. I think of fathers who have not been able to break the violent cycle that have been in their families for generations. The good news is there is a way out of this hurt. There are many professionals who can help us. There are great tools such as the Enneagram that can help you to be your best. #family #fathersday #identitycoach #innerpeace #selflove #selfawareness #selfconfident #selfcare #enneagram #empoweringwomen #emotionalintelligence #emotionalcare #mentalhealth #lifecanbebetter #personaldevelopement #lifecoaching #yorktonsaskatchewan #saskatchewan #canada #usa #unitedkingdom #rolandleggecoaching #rolandlegge #internationalcoachingfederation #iea #icfsaskatchewan #masculinity #youareamazing #socialjustice #socialchange

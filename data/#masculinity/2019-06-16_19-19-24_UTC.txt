These images are from “GOD”—The second theme from the series, which calls the men to encompass the expression of spiritual freedom and ascension from the societal hindrance of what is expected from Black men. Lyrics, such as, "This what God feel like..." calls the men to convey their interpretation of the Divine Feminine Energy (the act of worshipping of oneself, intuition, and creation).

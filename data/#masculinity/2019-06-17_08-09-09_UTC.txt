Most of us are too proud or too unconscious to admit it, but it is extremely hard to be a Man. This is why so many of us give up even trying.

I love to share my philosophies, strengths and my victories on Instagram and to anyone bored enough to listen, Â but I am only now (at the age of 40), understanding why it is so important for my own spiritual development to share my weaknesses and my failures in equal measure.

My "Insta life" and my 'real life" don't always reflect perfectly and I experience as much chaos and tragedy on the journey of becoming everything I was created to be, whilst also navigating this tricky 'maze of masculinity', as any man reading this.

But I am also here to tell you that even with all my frailties and failures, the universe is still determined to use me for something bigger, even with all my mistakes, which means it is detetmined to use you too.

So there are no capes or bullet proof vests in my wardrobe, its obvious to me at least, Batman was really Bruce Wayne. Bruce Wayne was not really Batman.

@nachsonm - Thank you for sharing the watch story in Stockholm, it gave me a profound paradigm shift and allowed me to see myelf through new eyes.ðŸ’ª #masculinity #winning #manhood #king #love #growth #spiritualdevelopment #strength #motivation #wellness #health #krptonite #vulnerable #invincible #silverback

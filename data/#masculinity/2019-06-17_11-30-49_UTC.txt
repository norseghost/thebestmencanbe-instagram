"I get a lot of stick for being the guy into fashion. I get a lot of stick for being the guy who wears heels. I grew up on a tiny island, Antigua. It is very much deﬁned by girls + guys, blue + pink, male + female.Then I moved to London. And since I’ve moved here, I’ve really embraced gender neutral clothing. I should be able to wear random identity heels and not feel judged for it. But there are still a lot of people who think gender belongs in boxes - it’s just a fucking joke, especially in 2019. If I want to wear a corset let me wear a corset. Let me be me!" - @iamstevain ⠀

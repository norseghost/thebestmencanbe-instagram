One of the greatest gifts this #strong, #steady, and #sexy #Man has given me is that he is unashamedly a Man. In a day and age where Women are finding their voice—while beautiful and powerful—has at times, more often than not, robbed Men of the glory of their #Masculinity to a point where Men seem to be overly cautious about taking charge... worse even, sometimes afraid to BE Men or lose their security of being Men, I must say, much of my confidence and strength as a #Woman is rooted in that #God blessed me with a #Man who knows his worth in God, is #secure in his masculinity, upholds and respects my #Femininity, respectful to others, is firm and gentle in his care of our #son, is #set in his values, is #fearless and #faithful, is both kind to others and a defender, and is #steady when the storms of this world are raging. God created both men and women equally but distinctly differently. We are partners designed to bring glory and honor to our God, and we should be proud of those differences, but more importantly, uplift, encourage, respect, and honor those differences. I am who I am because of God first, and thankfully, second, because I had the most amazing Man as a father, and now am married to both the #steadiest and #sexiestmanalive. I love my man.

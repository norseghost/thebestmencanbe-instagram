Today I had go cut off two people in my life but they were toxic and they didn't see me as a person. They saw me as this positivity toy and when they realized that hey I'm a real person with emotions and thoughts then they wanted nothing to do with me. I guess I'm better off without them because I'm not a doll or a toy who's job it is to agree with them all the time and make them  happy to the point its unhealthy for me.  I'm a person and I want to be treated as a person I won't apologize for that. ~ witchy

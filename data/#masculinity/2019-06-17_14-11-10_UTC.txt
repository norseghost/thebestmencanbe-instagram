Humbled, grateful & committed, working on my first book of many more to come by Divine grace. 🙏🏻✨ •

I remember saying as a teenager that I’d write a book as an adult. I recall so many friends throughout my life mentioning the phrase “you should write a book” after listening to stories of my life’s turmoils. I just didn’t imagine it would happen right now or that I’d write a book for Men. No doubt, God and Goddess have their mysterious ways. •

Here’s part of the prologue: •

If you’re feeling doubtful about reading a book for men that has the word ‘heart’ on the title, you’re not the only one. I’m actually feeling quite doubtful about writing it too, but let me tell you something: this book is a calling. And since callings never make sense and usually go against the status quo, I decided to gather my courage to start typing these words. I can’t tell whether I’ll be a witness to the success and impact of this book during my lifetime, but it’s precisely my heart that tells me this book will have the power to ignite many male hearts, enough male hearts to overcome the current silent crisis of men around the world, and above all, enough to make sure our next generations of boys and men are raised with the opportunity to love. •

With love & respect,
MaLe Corona ❤️ •

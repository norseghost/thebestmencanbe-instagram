Had a great father's day lunch with family and especially with this man right here. I couldn't ask for a better father he did everything he could to make sure I had a great childhood and was raised right. It is an honor to carry his surname! #highimpactmartialarts #teamhighimpact #happyfathersday #father #dad #son #fatherandson #thankyou #masculinity #manhood #man #realmanshit  #sensei

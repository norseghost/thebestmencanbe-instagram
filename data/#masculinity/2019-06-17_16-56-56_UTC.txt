MASCULINITY - My feed this morning is filled with the most touching images and reminders that we are surrounded by some AMAZING men!
.
In a society where masculinity is often assumed negative or "toxic", I hope most of us can realize that there is absolute necessity for masculinity and its balance in the world. Yes, there are many toxic examples out there too, but certainly not more than the amazing men who honor their partners, their children, make daily sacrifice for our health and happiness, love us deeply and still have a damn fun time doing it! Scroll your feed, see your yourself!!
.
To all the father figures, I truly hope you were honored, celebrated and thanked for all that you do! Your job is not easy in any way, and we love the way you love us. ❤️
.
Happy Father's Day!

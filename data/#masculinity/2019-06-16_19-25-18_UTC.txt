It’s, for me, unfortunate that Father’s Day falls during Pride month. Many of us have childhoods that were not soft, nor pretty. If your dad doesn’t support you, accept you, or love you, I’m here to reassure you that it’s okay to harbor the feelings that you have. Fathers often leave an imprint on us of how we interpret masculinity, which is a struggle for a lot of us gender nonconforming folks. If you need a daddy, i’m always here to teach you and show you all of the things your dad should have.

Repost from @tomorrowman_au As part of #menshealthweek, we are sharing some stories from blokes about times in their lives when they’ve been up against it and how they got through to the other side. ⠀
.⠀
Talking about the shit that matters not only helps us as men share the load and get some support, but it also lets other blokes know we're not alone in our struggles and challenges.⠀
.⠀
Here’s to telling it how it is and learning from each other’s experiences - first up, Ryder on break ups. #menshealthweek #talkwithgravity #vulnerabilityisstrength #tomorrowmanaustralia⠀

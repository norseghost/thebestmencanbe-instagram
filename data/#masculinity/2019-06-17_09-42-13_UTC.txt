Focus on Little Wins
. 
This is one of the simplest, but most effective motivational strategies.
.
Oftentimes, staring down the barrel of a big goal can be intimidating.
.
Maybe the stakes are high, or maybe you just feel overwhelmed and don’t feel like you can accomplish the goal.
.
To stay motivated in that situation, it helps to find the little “wins” throughout the process.
.
As mountain climbers who’ve tackled Everest recount, they don’t think about getting to the peak of the mountain; they’re just thinking about reaching the next camp.
.
One day at a time, one step at a time. Create smaller milestones for yourself, and do everything you can to celebrate each one as an accomplishment in its own right.
.
Like just being able to fool around and be silly with this little big man of mine. .

At least 50% of TransMen attempt suicide at least once in their lives.
My first thought: But that doesnâ€™t count the ones that actually succeeded.
â€¢
This truth isnâ€™t exactly something shocking to me-
I talk with TranMen all the time who are battling self hate, depression, thoughts of suicide.
I was a TransMan who suffered from suicidal thoughts as young as 12 years old-
I donâ€™t talk in depth about my past battles with depression, self harm and other negative thoughts or feelings.
â€¢
Iâ€™m sorry- because I donâ€™t want to add to the illusion that anything is wrong with you if you are sad.
I really just want you to know that if I can do it- so can you.
We all have our own journey and I cannot tell you which is the best for you-
But I can say to surround yourself with positive people and BEING A MAN means owning up to your feelings and asking your Brotherhood for help
â€¢
Letâ€™s break the stigma-
If you or someone you know is suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts or self harm actions
Drop a ðŸ’™ to show your support

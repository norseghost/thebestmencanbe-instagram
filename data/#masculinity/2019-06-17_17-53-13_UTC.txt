You’re right— this has nothing to do with firearms, preparedness, personal defense, or our constitutional rights. This is something more important that we, as humans, like to avoid, because being open about our spiritual condition and needs isn’t cool, macho, or “sexy”. Guys, we all want to look and act like a bearded SF operator, but this podcast refocuses on what actually holds water with regards to “manning up” in our homes and communities.  The hosts touch on how society is degrading what it means to be a real man— for the Christ followers out here, this podcast takes it to a pretty deep level. For those who aren’t Christ followers, I still encourage you to give this episode a listen, because there is lots of information in here that is relevant to your efforts to care and provide for your  families and communities— but don’t overlook the necessity of knowing how to impact your world  for Christ by being an accepting believer and servant of God! This is a huge part of being guardians, sheepdogs, warriors, etc— let’s not  get so caught in being dangerous that we overlook how to truly be good.

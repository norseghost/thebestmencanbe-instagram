A real man:
Accepts responsibility 
Rejects passivity
Leads courageously
Loves intensely

I'm celebrating the real men in my life, and father's everywhere, who slow down, grab little hands, reject selfishness, embrace inconvenience, and struggle, so that those coming up under them thrive. You understand that the greater reward comes after. Thank you for showing up. 
In a world that's agressively making space for women, sometimes at the expense of manliness, I'm going to push back a little. *Real masculinity is not toxic, it's necessary. *A good man's presence in our lives is completely underrated and absolutely essential. 
Don't think I can honor these men enough. Homemade biscuits and chocolate chip cookies or basically anything they want. 
Happy Father's Day! 
If you're lucky enough to have at least one great man in your life, tell him so!

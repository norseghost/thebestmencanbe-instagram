As men, we are responsible for protecting our families. When my first daughter was born, a lot about me changed. One of the first priorities was protection.  I took the necessary steps to protect my wife and her. A shotgun wasn’t good enough. That’s why I need an AR15. Men, what do you use to protect your families? Stay toxic. #thetoxicman #toxicmasculinity #toxic #masculine #masculinity #lawenforcement #policeofficer #police #officer #deputysheriff #sheriffdeputy #military #armedforces #firefighters #theartofmanliness #liftingweights #weightlifter #pewpewpew #thepewpewlife #conservative #republican #republicans #maga #ar15 #guns #lift #sheepdog  #thinblueline #redpill #gymshark

He’ll Be Okay - growing gorgeous boys into good men by Celia Lashlie 
Genre - Non-fiction, parenting, boys 
Style - Personal voice, direct, frank, heartfelt 
High point - That Lashlie is so positive and about boys and men, about their good qualities, that we need to believe in and trust our young men, that “When he knows it’s up to him and only him whether something is done or doesn’t get done, when he’s able to link action with consequences, then he’ll begin to make good decisions for himself.”
Low point - Though Lashlie means we need to be supportive while giving our young men space some might interpret this as mum’s need to change (not the message) - could also look a little more at our non-masculine boys
Take away - Humour, love, space, independence - He’ll be okay

In trying to encourage more men to talk about their emotions, here are some healthy alternatives to say instead of ‘stop crying’...⠀
⠀
1. It’s ok to be sad⠀
2. This is really hard for you⠀
3. I’m here with you⠀
4. Tell me about it⠀
5. I hear you⠀
6. That was really bad, sad etc⠀
7. I will help you work it out⠀
8. I’m listening⠀
9. I hear that you need space, I want to be here for you. I’ll stay close so you can find me when you’re ready⠀
10. It doesn’t feel fair⠀

|| The Sacredness Of Men’s Work || After experiencing deep and profound disharmony in my own life, having traversed my version of hell and back multiple times it became clear that I must dedicate my life to serving those who choose to also walk a deeper path of awareness.

I feel privilege every time I am able to step in to a space and be present to the needs, exploration and willingness of others.

Whether it be facilitating the cosmic, yet grounding journey of breath work (seen here), speaking to large groups of men on the evolution of their own masculinity, working with groups of women in helping them feel, give their hearts and understand men, one on one deep visceral work, shamanic type exploration or simply being a support, my mission is to serve.

Whether it’s with brothers @jason___mack @adam___jackson @aubertbastiat @innerlightwarrior or serving alongside my beloved @christinehassler healing the collective masculine/feminine wounding; I am here to add value to the course of humanity’s direction. The truth is... We all are. What is your gift? What are you inspired by? How can you give the fullness of you to a world that needs all of you...? I work with men helping shift their consciousness around their own sense of self, worth, masculinity and power. I help them relate to what matters most to them - their purpose, families, women and earth.

We are here to transmute the old and transform in to the new. Are you ready to grow with me? Allow me to guide you, hold your journey as you are empowered to go deeper than you have ever gone. Yes, it will be confronting, but fuck, it will be liberating. You will feel freedom for the first time like never before.

Join me... LINK IN BIO... And for an intensive event with a small group of men facilitated by me and my powerful brothers in August in Southern California, stay tuned - more details to come. You can PM for this.

One is glad to be of service.

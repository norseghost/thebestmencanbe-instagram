Happy monday peeps. Here's a pic of me and the boys just doing what blue collar men do, keeping this country running. .
Here's another thought following up to my last post. "You will know them by their fruit". You have to choose your friends wisely and this sounds cliche but it is key. When it comes to the company you keep quality is miles above quantity. I don't know if any man is a complete lone wolf because human beings are dependent on each other in many ways but your circle of friends must be tight, vetted and proven loyal, trustworthy and honorable. When you see red flags mounting in a person your level of trust should drop down low because that's lifes way of pointing them out and saying "watch out for that one right there". Take it from me, I have experience being a disloyal friend as well as being betrayed so I speak from experience on both sides of this equation.

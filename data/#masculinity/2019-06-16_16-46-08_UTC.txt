I absolutely adore the character of Logan and couldn't imagine anyone other than Hugh Jackman as the bearer of the image in the several X-Men films. What I love so much about James Logan / Wolverine is how he is so clearly a soft-hearted, loving and lovable being despite the violent situations in which he is forced to violently defend himself and his loved ones. Logan keeps a heart of love and longing for peace unto his last breath and is never truly corrupted by the evil that might have overwhelmed him so many times, even though he is often very prickly and standoffish to the point of humor. He is more humane and deeply protective of innocent lives than the ostensibly purely-human non-mutants that try to harm him and those he loves. What a message of the righteous-hearted "animalistic" beings among us.

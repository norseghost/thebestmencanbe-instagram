“I have two kids. My nine year old son grew up with me. I have a fifteen year old daughter, and I wasn’t there for her all these years because I was in and out of jail; we barely started really talking two or three years ago. Our relationship is good now— we call and we talk, text each other.

She even texted me yesterday to ask how I was doing, because she knew I was going through something. Her text made me cry because she said, ‘I know you’re going through it right now and I just want to tell you, even though you weren’t there for me, I still love you. You’re my dad and I really like our relationship right now.’ It’s been hard work, but it’s gotten better. She calls me every day now.

I just want them to look at me as an example. I tell them, ‘You don’t want to be like me, you don’t want to end up in this position.’ I want them to know everything is possible, for them to finish school and make better lives for themselves.

My favorite part is just being there for them, being able to see them grow up— to see them happy. I want to be a good father and for them to have more memories with me.” - Alvin Paez, Trainee at Homeboy Industries

Parents deserve our respect and thanks for everything they do for us.  That’s why we have a Mother’s Day and a Father’s Day.

Some people want to ban Father’s Day because it’s “offensive to single mothers and same sex couples”. Here’s a novel idea: if your dad left and you’re being raised by a single mother, don’t celebrate Father’s Day.  It’s so simple.  Don’t be a baby and go online trying to ruin it for those who do want to celebrate their dad.  As for the same sex couples part, wouldn’t Mother’s Day be just as offensive to same sex couples as Father’s Day is, by that logic?  Again.  If you have two moms, just celebrate Mother’s Day.  If you have two dads celebrate Father’s Day.  It’s so simple.

And I know that if someone tried to ban Mother’s Day, they’d get hunted down with torches and pitchforks. #doublestandards

Yesterday was Father's Day. 
I had 3 Dad's to call.
My Bio Father
My sister's Father, Daddy D 
And My Stepdad, Big Mike

I called Big Mike 1st
Then I called Daddy D..
•
•
Bio Dad was called LAST. We aren't close but, things are getting better.
Yesterday he said he was proud of me. 
Said I was growing up to be a wonderful Womxn. •
•
He went on to comment about how he, "doesn't agree" with all of my "Decisions" but loves me and supports me, "anyways". He was referring to my being Gender Never-Conforming and pursuing top surgery.
•
•
First the fuck off. 
No one asked you what you thought about what EYE was doing with my life.
I ain't never need no approval from no man EVER. •
•
I'm really going to try to not take this backhanded compliment to heart. •
•
But to all the parents that MEAN WELL:
That ain't enough.
•
•
I hung up with that fuck nigga and CRIED like the hardest cry. Then I took my ass shopping, bought some cute shit, went on a cute as dinner date and was treated to Ice Cream. •
•
Happy fuckin Fathers Day to ME!

Women, they have a dark side, but like men, they a light side to them too.
.
Women can be all those bad things but they can be all those good things too.
.
You just have to be an Alpha, strong, calm, grounded, masculine, man to bring it out.
.
They either shape up or shit out and if they value you and want to be apart of you world then they'll shape up.

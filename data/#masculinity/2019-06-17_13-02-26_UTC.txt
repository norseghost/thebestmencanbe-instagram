Brett and Jake continue the three part series about the internal world. After Brett shares how his internal world reacted when getting home from a long day at work, the value of examining the stories we tell ourselves are discussed. Brett and Jake then offer a simple 3 part process for navigating our internal worlds. The podcast ends with a discussion of how a core reality of the Christian life is allowing Jesus to enter and heal our inner worlds.

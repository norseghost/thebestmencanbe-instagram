This is one of my favorite videos of all time (scroll to the end). Not just because of the excitement of the moment, and the thrill of helping Kaitlyn achieve a skill she never thought she’d throw on the floor, but because of you.
.
That look on your face.
.
That’s the look I’ve always strived to see on your face. And it’s been there my entire life. You’ve always been right where you are in this video - behind me with a BIG, PROUD smile, supporting me! No matter what I’ve ever wanted to do, I know that I could never disappoint you because you’ve always just been proud to be my father.
.
And what an amazing father you’ve always been Pop! I’m SO GRATEFUL for the man you are and the man you’ve helped me to become. For the shining example of love and support you’ve given me, and how you’ve shown me what vulnerable masculinity looks like! For messaging or calling me EVERY DAY just to let me know how much you love me! You’re an amazing man, for so many amazing reasons, and I want you to know that I’m beyond eternally grateful and thankful that I got YOU as my daddy!!!
.
I love you man, more than you’ll ever know or understand!!!

Happy Father’s Day to the greatest daddy-o in the game!!! 😜🤙🏽💪🏽

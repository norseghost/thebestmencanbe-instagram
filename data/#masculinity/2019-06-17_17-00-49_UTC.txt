Hey, everyone. Happy Monday - we have a new episode up today! Listen through our link in our bio. Today we are honored to be joined by the writer Thomas Page McBee. 
Thomas is author of the memoir, Man Alive (2014) and reported memoir, Amateur (2018), about learning to connect with masculinity through boxing. With that experience, Thomas became the first trans man to fight in Madison Square Garden. Thomas has written for the television shows Tales of the City (2019, Netflix) and The L Word (2019, Showtime) as well as publications such as Teen Vogue, The New York Times, The Cut and Playboy. It turns out he's great at giving advice too. 
Give it a listen! (And tell a friend!) ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›

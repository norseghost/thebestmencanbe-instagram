B L A C K & P R O U D

Wishing you a wonderful black Monday - being you and being proud.👐👐 P.s why is it so hard for black people to look each other in the eye on the streets of Denmark? What reflection are we hesitating to meet? Especially if they have fully "integrated" in the Danish society?  Wouldn't it lovelier to acknowledge each other, look up and appreciate😊😆 -"Ubuntu, I am because we all are"

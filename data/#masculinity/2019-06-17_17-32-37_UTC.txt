This Friday I will be sharing ‘Dear Sir’  a performance I have been developing slowly over the past few years.

The performance takes a look at my understanding of masculinity and what that is like within different communities.

It looks at my experiences as a gay man, as an only child within a mainly male dominated family, at the relationship between my mental health and masculinity as well as some other things. 
It is a deeply personal performance, that manages to laugh with and celebrate positive masculinity whilst also shedding light on some of the more serious elements.

It would really mean a lot for as many people as possible to come along. If you would like to then the performance is at @upstairsatthewestern this Friday at 7:30pm. Tickets are available from the upstairs at the Western website.

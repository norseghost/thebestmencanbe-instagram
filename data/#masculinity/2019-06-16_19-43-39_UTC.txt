Move to Embody and Explore the Beauty within.
.
.
Sometimes when I approach a sacred time of movement: it‚Äôs soft, loud, wild, sexy and everything in between. I love showing up for every part of my womanhood. .addressing the shadow within and facing the feminine and masculine energy within me. It‚Äôs amazing what happens when your supper power within you 
Is honored and invited to the table. It‚Äôs from this place of acknowledgement that embodiment begins to manifest in our lives. .

Letting Go and Flowing, 
Embracing,
No longer resisting
Creation
Breaking Down 
Boxes 
For sweet Bliss 
To heal oneself and deeply 
Embody the light within me

Pulling in this truth today, ‚ÄúFor it is not from man that we draw our life but from God as we are being joined to Jesus, the Anointed One.‚Äù
1 Corinthians 1:30

What if you started today, moving your body in the way it speaks to you? I believe in you, 
Go on .

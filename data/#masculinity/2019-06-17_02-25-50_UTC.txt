Happy Father’s Day 🏹♾⚓️
May the World come to know 
the importance and necessity of 
genuine paternal energy
which commands Authority 
without cruelty 
and protects Purity 
at all costs; sows only worthy and loving seeds 
in the fertile minds, hearts, and 
souls of Children and Woman🙏🏻
The patriarchy does not need to be eliminated 
but carefully cultivated and preserved 
by Men and Women of Honor. 
The domestication of males 
will not create less toxic masculinity 
or failed fathers. It will only 
impair our boys and men 
from filling their boots. 
Today I honor and hold compassion in my Heart for the immense duty of Fatherhood and all who attempt it with sincerity, fortitude, chivalry and Faith. 🖤

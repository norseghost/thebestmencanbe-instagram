DON'T MISTAKE APPROVAL FOR PERMISSION.

Permission and approval are not the same thing.

It's great to receive approval and external validation for what you want to do or say or create. It feels good.

Yet some people think that before they will give themselves permission to take action, they need to wait until they get outside approval for the things they want to say or the projects they want to implement.

Whether it's from a parent. 
A friend. 
A mentor. 
A guru. 
Their tribe. 
An organization.

And I know many people, including myself, who actually get approval for who they are and what they say, but that doesn't automatically translate into them giving themselves permission to fully step into their power. To do and express what they really want.

But the reality is the only permission that's needed is your own.
There is no accreditation organization for being you. You don't need any letters after your name. You can't get certified as yourself.

Permission is an inside job.

And the funny thing is, the people that give themselves permission, without waiting for external approval, are often the ones who get external approval anyways. But by that point they don't need it.

Of course you can always consider this post as giving you the permission you need, but that would just be weird, wouldn't it? - Jeffrey

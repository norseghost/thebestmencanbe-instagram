Men, can I invite you to "get real" with me for a moment? What keeps you from talking about sex openly and honestly? ⠀
⠀
In my time as a sex educator and podcaster, I've observed my fair share of guys talking about sex, but only in a braggy, jokey way... especially if they're around other men. ⠀
⠀
⠀
Perhaps its the lack of vocabulary, the fear of being judged or this idea that it won't be considered masculine to talk about sex in that way. ⠀
⠀
⠀
I happen to think real men talk about sex openly, and aren't afraid to be honest about their feelings. But let me know what you think?⠀

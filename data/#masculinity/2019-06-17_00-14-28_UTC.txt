It’s Father Day, and have the opportunity to reflect on a few  fathers in my life. For one, there is deep gratitude for my dad, @faragon22 and his embodiment what it means to serve and protect. He serves the homeless community weekly, often sharing his heart with me to stop for the one. Even when faced with transition, good & hard times, It has been a true joy seeing him be the light to others to me and others around him. I’m grateful for my dad and his spirit.  Standing by me, encouraging me along the way, and reminding me that God is paving a wave for me to walk out my destiny. 
More recently, It has been a true joy realizing that my desire to build takes focus and dedication. The entrepreneurial spirit is in my blood and am thankful to honor that within and move it forward. Jesus at center 🙏🏼

@richardgordon_ for showing me so much of the Father’s love during my time in Redding. Excited for you and Libby to welcome your little one soon. Had a dream months prior about you getting pregnant, 🙌🏼

I could go on and on about all the men and fathers who have championed me along the way. {Father God, has led me to this beautiful place in life where I truly enjoy co creating with and listening to his guidance.}

Honoring all the men out there. As a woman, I deeply appreciate your presence on this earth. As I become more in tune with both my masculine and feminine essence I more aware that God truly is a wonder in creating both female and male. .

Men, might men of valor, I honor you 🙏🏼

Radio talk show host and Founder of The Veritas Radio Network’s CRUSADE Channel, Mike “The KingDude” Church is leading a Procession and Rosary Rally in response to the “UNJust Cause, A Boozy Bake Sale” an event we have dubbed “Bake To Kill”. This event was organized to raise funds for Gulf Coast Planned Parenthood and give infanticide defenders the chance to make a statement about the “right” to kill your soon to be born child. We will meet in the parking lot next to Saint Patrick’s Cathedral on Camp Street at 3:00pm Saturday June 22nd, then Process with Our Lady of Prompt Succor leading the way to the “Bake To Kill” party and pray the 3 Mysteries of the Holy Rosary, pleading with Our Blessed Mother to restore New Orleans as the greatest Catholic City in the U.S. and protect and defend all human life therein – as Saint Joan d’Arc did for Orleans and France. @iamkingdude

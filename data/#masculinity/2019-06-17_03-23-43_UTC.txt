As a trans man I spent a lot of time in isolation...grieving the communities I lost with my transition and unsure of where I belonged moving forward and too afraid of rejection to find out. But through my own healing I have come to realize how much of that isolation was of my own making and how much of my fears are universal fears. Today, I spent the majority of my time getting to know the other guys without thinking about it or hesitating or holding back or trying to show up in a particular way. We laughed. We talked about our dreams. We contemplated the unknown. We prayed. We read poetry. We shared our journeys to this point. We reflected on our repressed inner children and artists. We saw each other and held space. We talked masculinity and women ruling the world. We joked. We complimented each other and traded fashion tips. We shared stories of state powers and war and pain. I am grateful to be in space with this global group of imperfect men who care deeply in heart and in hand. And I am grateful in the knowing that I am enough as I am. #men #masculinity #truth #qtpoc #transmen

I had an opportunity to interview @iangiles about the making of ‘After Butt’, a meditation on the legacy of #buttmagazines, a seminal publication (2001-2011) founded by Amsterdam-based editors @gertjonkers and @jopvanbennekom “to tackle mainstream gay aesthetic of perfectly groomed men with something dirtier, frank, more raw” 
The screening was part of the events programme of @strangeperfume at @southlondongallery , followed by an interesting Q&A hosted by @bethsaha, programme coordinator at @afteralljournal Archive Centre at @unioftheartslondon 👏🏻

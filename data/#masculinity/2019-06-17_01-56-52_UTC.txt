Some of you may have noticed the long gap since my last post. At some point I will give a long explanation. But for today I will summarize. 
As some of you know, my wife and I had been experiencing a very complicated and problematic pregnancy with twin boys. Following some significant complications they were born significantly premature (26 weeks). Each was 1lbs. 14oz. Both have experienced significant issues although one, Matthew, much more so than his brother Henry. .

To say these past several weeks have been difficult is an understatement. Today, for example, I began my Father's Day when my wife answered a call from the hospital that Henry was going to have emergency surgery. Fortunately, we just moved our family to a location across the street from the hospital. Our home is an 1.5 - 2.5 hous away due to traffic so getting closer is important. The boys will be here until at least August.

My wife, two other children and I remain faithful that the twins will see a recovery and that the hands of God will work on them. We ask for your prayers. .

As we find a new routine I will try to get back to posting and generating content and moving other plans for the Guild forward. The biggest item of which is our planned Podcast, which I put on hold when all of these issues began. I look forward to sharing more of the details of what we have been through, and what I have learned about manhood, fatherhood and life, having gone through this experience. .

In the meantime, Happy Father's Day to all you amazing father's out there. Be grateful for your children and their health. God Bless. #fatherhood #dads #fathers #manhood #masculinity #man #men #babies #twins #nicu #suffering #strength #faith #healing #prayer #love #premature

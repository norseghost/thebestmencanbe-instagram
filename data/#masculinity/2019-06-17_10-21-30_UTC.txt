"How am I gonna prove that I'm good enough?" A question that most of us ask ourselves more than we need to, as Tim Drury from @fite108_muay_thai_ points out "The people that come to support me, they support me no matter what"

Thanks to Tim for speaking at @heartsandminds_barber for the June mental health night talk.  A world champion fighter and career that includes work as a police officer, community service worker, child protection officer and business owner at Fite108 Muay Thai/Boxing & MMA Tim shared some great insights with us all.

Special thanks to #Domino's Pizza #LakeHaven for their continued support along with Coles #Toukley who have helped keep our costs down, allowing us to focus on the purpose which is connecting people and sparking conversations about mental health in our community.

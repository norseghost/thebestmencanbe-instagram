JUNE 2019: WOW!!! The 5th anniversary of this reading series could not have been more beautiful & nourishing. All praises & gratitude to the generous & magnificent @frankiesotopoetry - our first feature in June 2015 - for returning with gorgeous new work that challenges perceptions of masculinity, fatherhood, race & mental health. We were all so blessed to be in the room where this happened. @cyrus.life #cyruslife #secondsaturdays #poetry #art #fathersday #fatherhood #masculinity #latinx #puertorico #frankiesotopoetry #courage #truth #spokenword

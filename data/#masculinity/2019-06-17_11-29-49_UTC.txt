"Fashion opens up pathways to express yourself. It’s not about wearing tight clothes to just show your muscles.  But now we don’t care. As guys we can do our own thing. If you wanna wear baggy clothes, wear baggy clothes if that’s your vibe. You can show your masculinity through anything and that’s bless." - @taylor-kae-knott⠀

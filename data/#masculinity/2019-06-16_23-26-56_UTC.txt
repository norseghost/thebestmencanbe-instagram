Its #fathersday #2019 . First off, my dad ain't shit. My #godfather , however, is a blessing from the #universe . I was very fortunate to have crossed paths with him.

Now, what I find sad about our #society is that #dads don't get as good a rap as #moms , even those that bust their asses to do for their kids. Many kids go without a dad or they have such a piss poor dad that they grow up broken and have #daddyissues .

For #boys, dad teaches them the important #lifelessons on how to be a successful #man . For #girls , dad is the first #rock or foundation of #strength they ever have in the #world ; he teaches her how to trust #men . Without a good #father , kids suffer in #development .

Happy #fathersday! What looks like a small Mormon is actually me, and what looks like me is actually my #dad. Holding my child-briefcase (with pinky-finger extended), I am in fact about to go to work with my dad at the #publicdefender’s office. I’m grateful to my father for providing such a rare and aspirational example of #maturity, #humor, #manhood, and enlightened #masculinity.

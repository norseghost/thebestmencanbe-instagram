Some people have dad's, but I have bunnies.  Well I mean, I had a few fathers, I even called the one I look like today, but beyond voicemale, abandonment, violence, and inappropriate behavior, I have a mom who let me have bunnies growing up.  I'm thankful for her, these fluffy creatures, and all the males who have built safety and trust with me and who are in the struggle to clarify love with/for me.  #witness #reflect #evolve #masculinity #struggleisreal #fathersday #honoringholydays

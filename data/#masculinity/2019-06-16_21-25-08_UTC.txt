Rock bottom is not where “I found myself”.⁣

Rock bottom is where I went due to the choices I made, it’s there I chose to take ownership. ⁣
⁣
Taking ownership allowed me to take my power back, in ownership I found the tools to build; I built this from the ground up. ⁣
⁣
I’m not the man I know I can be yet, but I’m closer than ever, I have all the tools, and I’m clear on what has to be done to get there. ⁣
⁣
If you are ready to get clear on the man you were born to be, to take ownership, step into your power and start to build; I’m waiting, let’s build. ⁣

Today is Trinity Sunday. On this day, we celebrate the Holy Trinity, the three pieces of The Lord: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Saint Thomas Becket was consecrated as Archbishop of Canterbury on the Sunday after Pentecost, and his first act was to ordain that the day of his consecration should be held as a new festival in honor of the Holy Trinity. This observance spread from Canterbury throughout the whole of western Christendom. The Athanasian Creed, focused on Trinitarian doctrine and Christology, is sometimes, although not often, recited in certain Anglican churches today, usually in High Church and traditional settings. It can be found in the Historical Documents section of the 1979 Episcopal Book of Common Prayer, but its use is not specifically provided for in the rubrics of the prayer book. Trinity Sunday has the status of a Principal Feast in the Church of England and, of course, is one of seven principal feast days in the Episcopal Church. Anglican parishes with an Anglo-Catholic churchmanship observe Corpus Christi the following Thursday, or, in some cases, the following Sunday. Have a blessed Trinity Sunday everybody, and may the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit guide us and care for us all.

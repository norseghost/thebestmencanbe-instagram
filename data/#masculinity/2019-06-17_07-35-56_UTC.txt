#MASCULINITY - here’s my take after doing my own research and reading to understand the crux of the matter. i grew up, like many many alike in the same environment and so, what i have come to learn is to ask the many questions like “why do i feel the way that i do?” i never felt comfortable playing out the macho card, and am STILL continuing to breakdown those traits in me TODAY. i say UNEDUCATED EMOTIONALLY bc it means we can TURN IT AROUND AND IT IS NOT IN OUR DNA. it’s socially constructed - address your emotions 💙✊🏿

The full moon of this cycle, is about releasing final burdens, to propel you into your official bloom. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
What were your lessons this cycle?  What obstacles did you face this lunar rounding? Where are you needing to let go, to allow in? ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
All that you have been working on.  All the seeds you have planted in your winter season.  It is time for you to EAT, and eat good!  But first, you must release, and let go of that final chord still attached to your emotional body. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Let go of all that doesn‚Äôt serve you with gratitude.  Have no fear.  What you are releasing, will lead to a momentous joyous time, far greater than you can imagine! ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Celebrate!  Let go with gratitude!  You have arrived!!!! ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Love,
G1 ‚Ä¢

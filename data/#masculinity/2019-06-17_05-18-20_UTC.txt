This is my Pops. This man was the one, I know everyone who had a good dad thinks he is the best, but he really was. The man was a legend, Jack of all trades, master of none. He had both a strong man's man fix it if it's broke and have a beer side, and an empathetic and emotional one. A great man who demonstrated to me that masculinity did not have to be limiting. He was a tough son of a bitch and a big hearted fool who gave love unlimited chances. I love you still Pops, sorry you missed the road trip, hope you would be alright with what I'm doing.  Happy Father's day. #loss #missingsomeone #dad #father #greatdads #fathersday #happyfathersday #pops #legend #blackandwhite #grayscale #oldman #mansman #masculinity #goodman #love

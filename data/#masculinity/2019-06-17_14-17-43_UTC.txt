A man should always be thirsting for a deep knowledge of his own Faith than the world, because that’s an incentive to strive towards Heaven.

We men should never say, “I know and totally understand my Church and Faith”

No.

This mindset has resulted in many men having a false idea of what the Mother Church is and displays complacency in trusting that they have learned enough and don’t need to know more.

Like cleaning a weapon or maintaining a car, a man must pore over scriptures from the Bible, the Catechism, teachings of the Saints, and through other men who have a strong sense of Faith.

Gentlemen, always strive to learn more about the Faith for the rest of your life, and ensure that other men within your circle do the same.

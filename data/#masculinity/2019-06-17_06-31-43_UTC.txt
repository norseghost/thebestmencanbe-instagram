As a dual citizen of Canada and Finland, I extend a belated Happy Father's Day to my honorable dad, Taimo Majalahti.

Dad lost his wife of 52 years, my Mom, last October after a long battle with Alzheimer's. Today, he works as a pastor and minister to refugees coming to Finland, helping them find The Way, The Truth and The Light. At 82, he still hasn't retired from his calling in ministry.

Here's to my Dad, who taught me to be a knowledgeable Man. Unwavering, solid, strong, courageous, respected and full of heart. I was never confused growing up, thanks to a strong upbringing and example. Today, I know what I am as a Man, and I owe that to my Father. 
Happy Father's Day, Dad!

My father was not a perfect man, but he was a loving one. It took him a long time to be a presence in my life. When he passed away I clung to memories of when he would drive me to college to help me move in, and then weâ€™d get cheeseburgers. I often reflect on his softening, the one I witnessed at the end of his life. He more often said no to work and expressed what was going on behind his calm eyes. Because of him I cherish when I see kindness in men. I wish the softness would extend forever, to become the new code of men.

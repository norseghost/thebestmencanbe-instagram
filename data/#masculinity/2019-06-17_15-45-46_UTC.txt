When your eyes speak louder than words! There is a saying, 'Eyes are the windows to the soul.' It means, mostly, people can see through someone else by eye contact. ... Not only love, eyes can communicate respect, threat, interest, boredom, honesty, intimacy, and encouragement as well.
Keep praying and preparing. Love is in the Air ❤️-

I'm grateful to have men in my life who show up and do their best.

All around me, I am blessed to have men supporting and encouraging me when I need it.

It's a fallacy to think we are alone or that we are weak if we accept help from others. All the evidence proves the opposite.

This past weekend, my friend Oscar, an amazing human and arborist, came and trimmed our trees. It was so rewarding and fun to work together guided by his expertise to extend the health and longevity of these stately beings. He also helped plant a few new trees!

In a men's group I did last year one of the first questions we asked one another was how do you like support. I have to admit that I had never asked myself that question. But how could I receive support if I didn't even know how I preferred it? And if I hadn't uncovered what I needed how could I take the first step of asking for it?

In the process of growth I have learned and challenge myself to be man enough to ask for help. The flip side of an unwillingness to ask is an inability to receive. We live in such an abundant world, it's foolesh to cut ourselves off from what is naturally flowing all around us, like air.

Air flows into your lungs from the first second out of your mother's womb yet we train ourselves  to hold our breath and breath as if we are breathing through a straw. Open those lungs! The universe provides!

Ask and ye shall receive!
If you don't ask you can't recieve.

How do you recieve support?

I know a lot of my brother's are struggling out there and feel alone. I want you to know you are not alone. If you need anything, please reach out. I am here for you.

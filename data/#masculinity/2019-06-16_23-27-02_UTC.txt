Mark Nepo - ”Freefall”

If you have one hour of air
And many hours to go,
You must breathe slowly.
If you have one arm’s length
and many things to care for,
You must give freely.
If you have one chance to know God
And many doubts, you must
Set your heart on fire.
We are blessed.
Each day is a chance.
We have two arms.
Fear wastes air.

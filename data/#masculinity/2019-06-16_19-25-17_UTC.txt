One of the most cringeworthy phrases I hear, little dude... is, “Be a man.” Especially when it’s said to young boys, because the message is often: “Be tough.  Don’t cry.  Suck it up.  Act like nothing affects you.” To me... that’s just empty posturing.  Being a real man means being strong enough to be empathetic. To be sensitive. To be caring, kind, and confident enough to appreciate and nurture your feminine side.  If you start with that as a base, all that other stereotypically “manly” behavior (none of which is exclusive to males, btw) might just accomplish some good.  But in the meantime... it’s okay to be a boy. ❤️

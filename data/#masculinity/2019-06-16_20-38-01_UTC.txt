Another Appearance on Dear Men Podcast! Episode 52: #GuyTalk on Leading on & Being Led on.
.
Dear Men explores #HealthyMasculinity on #Dating and #Relationships. Periodically, the podcast delves into the same topic in two parts, one as Guy Talk, one as #GirlTalk (#51).
.
Personally, the stories shared by #Women about being led on sound way more painful than the stories shared by #Men, which is partly why we focused on our pasts of having led women on.
.
We discuss why we did it, how #ToxicMasculinity promotes it, and how we can do better.
